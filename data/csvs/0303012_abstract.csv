The high-energy limit of stringy symmetries, derived from the decoupling of
two types of zero-norm states in the old covariant first quantized (OCFQ)
spectrum of open bosonic string , are used to reproduce Gross's linear
relations among high-energy scattering amplitudes of different string states
with the same momenta. Moreover, the proportionality constants between
scattering amplitudes of different string states are calculated for the
first few low-lying levels. These proportionality constants are, as
suggested by Gross from the saddle point calculation of high-energy
string-loop amplitudes, independent of the scattering angle $\phi _{CM}$ and
the order $\chi $ of string perturbation theory. The decoupling of
degenerate positive-norm states , which is valid to \textit{all} energy, can
also be derived from these stringy symmetries. The high-energy limit of this
decoupling is found to be consistent with the work of Gross and Manes.
