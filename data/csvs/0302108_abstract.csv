This paper deals with magnetic equations of the type $dH=J$ where the current
$J$ is a $\delta$--function on a brane worldvolume and $H$ a $p$--form
field strength. In many situations in $M$--theory this equation
needs to be solved for $H$ in terms of a potential. A standard universality
class of solutions,
involving Dirac--branes, gives rise to strong intermediate singularities in
$H$ which in many physically relevant cases lead to inconsistencies. In this
paper we present an alternative universality class of solutions for magnetic
equations in
terms of Chern--kernels, and provide relevant applications, among
which the anomaly--free effective action for open $M2$--branes ending on
$M5$--branes.
The unobservability of the Dirac--brane requires a Dirac
quantization condition; we show that the requirement of ``unobservability''
of the Chern--kernel leads in $M$--theory to classical gravitational
anomalies which cancel precisely their quantum counterparts.
