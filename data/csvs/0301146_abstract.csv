Chern--Simons type Lagrangians in $d=3$ dimensions are analyzed
from the point of view of their covariance and globality. We use
the transgression formula to find out a new fully covariant and global
Lagrangian for Chern--Simons gravity: the price for establishing
globality is hidden in a bimetric (or biconnection) structure.
Such a formulation  allows to calculate from a global and
simpler viewpoint the energy-momentum
complex and the superpotential both for Yang--Mills and
gravitational examples.
