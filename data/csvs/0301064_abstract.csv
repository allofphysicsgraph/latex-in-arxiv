 We present an explicit relation between representations of the
 Virasoro algebra and polynomial martingales in stochastic Loewner
 evolutions (SLE). We show that the Virasoro algebra is the
 spectrum generating algebra of SLE martingales. This is based on a
 new representation of the Virasoro algebra, inspired by the
 Borel-Weil construction, acting on functions
 depending on coordinates parametrizing conformal maps.
