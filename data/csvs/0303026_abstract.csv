We identify a canonical transformation which maps the chiral Gross-Neveu model onto a recently
proposed Cooper pair model. Baryon number and axial charge are interchanged. The same physics
can be described either as chiral symmetry breaking (quark-antiquark pairing) or as superconductivity
(quark-quark pairing).
