In this lecture I make some educated guesses,  about the landscape
of  string theory vacua. Based on the recent work of a number of
authors, it seems plausible that the lanscape is unimaginably
large and diverse. Whether we like it or not, this is the kind of
behavior that gives credence to  the Anthropic Principle. I
discuss  the theoretical and conceptual  issues that arise in
developing a cosmology based on the diversity of environments
implicit in string theory.
