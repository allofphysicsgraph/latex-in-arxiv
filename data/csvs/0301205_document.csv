Within the framework of Relativistic Schr\""odinger Theory (an alternative form of quantum mechanics for relativistic many-particle systems) it is shown that a general N-particle system must occur in one of two forms: either as a ``positive'' or as a ``negative'' mixture, in analogy to the fermion-boson dichotomy of matter in the conventional theory. The pure states represent a limiting case between the two types of mixtures which themselves are considered as the RST counterparts of the entangled (fermionic or bosonic) states of the conventional quantum theory. Both kinds of mixtures are kept separated from dynamical as well as from topological reasons. The 2-particle configurations ($N=2$) are studied in great detail with respect to their geometric and topological properties which are described in terms of the Euler class of an appropriate bundle connection. If the underlying space-time manifold (as the base space of the fibre bundles applied) is parallelisable, the 2-particle configurations can be thought to be generated geometrically by an appropriate ($2+2$) splitting of the local tangent space.

\section{Introduction and Survey}

Surely one of the most striking features of matter refers to the fact that one encounters two distinct types of particles: fermions and bosons. As safely as this fact is established from both the conceptual and experimental point of view (for a review see ref.~\cite{Su90}), it seems unclear for most people what is the precise theoretical origin of this matter dichotomy and why there do not exist more than two kinds of material particles. In view of the lack of a right understanding of the reason why there are only two particle species, some people hold that one must first ``\emph{understand why nature makes such a particular choice from among a host of other possibilities}''~\cite{OhKa82}. Consequently for that purpose, they believe, one should ``\emph{pursue every theoretical possibility we may conceive at present}''~\cite{OhKa82} and these endeavours should refer to the rather general framework of paraquantization. Other people do not trouble themselves about the true origin of the fermion-boson dichotomy but take this simply as an experimentally based fact, and consequently they are content with rephrasing this fact in mathematical terms (i.e.\ the postulates of symmetrization for bosons and anti-symmetrization for fermions). In this sense, e.g., Dirac simply states that ``\emph{other more complicated kinds of symmetry are possible mathematically, but do not apply to any known particles}'' (ref.~\cite{Di98},~p.~211). 

One could go even one step further by resorting to the well-known \emph{anthropic principle}~\cite{Ha88} which may be evoked whenever a well-established observation cannot be based upon a sound theoretical foundation. Such a situation typically occurs in cosmology~\cite{KoTu90,ZhiXi89} but the present fermion-boson dichotomy could also evoke that principle, e.g. by asking: ``{\it Did God - for lack of a better word - build a series of failed worlds which spottered and died, or exploded and disintegrated, before discovering the stabilizing effect of anti-commutation relations for half-integral spin fields?}''~(ref.~\cite{DuSu98},~p.~4). However it rather seems reasonable to assume that the fermion-boson dichotomy ``{\it could conceivably be an essential ingredient of a more fundamental view of the world~\ldots This could be the case in fundamental string theories or their successors~\ldots}''~\cite{DuSu98}.

In any case, such an unclarified situation with the matter dichotomy should provide sufficient motivation for studying this problem also within the context of non-standard quantum theories. In this sense the present paper is devoted to the study of the matter dichotomy within the framework of Relativistic Schr\""odinger Theory (RST), an alternative form of quantum theory being based upon fluid-dynamic concepts rather than probabilistic ones~\cite{So97} -\cite{MaRuSo}. Indeed it has turned out that a matter dichotomy emerges in this theory in the form of positive and negative mixtures~\cite{RuSo01,RuSoIJTP} resembling very much the symmetrized (bosonic) and anti-symmetrized (fermionic) states of the conventional quantum theory: the positive mixtures imply a certain kind of \emph{fusion} of two particles into one charge density, and the negative mixtures describe the recession of the two charge densities from one another such that the density of one particle is zero in that region of space-time where the density of the other particle is non-zero (charge separation~\cite{RuSoIJTP}). Consequently both particles in a negative-mixture configuration are forbidden to occupy the same space-time points which evidently yields a ``stabilizing effect'' for composite matter coming about in the conventional quantum theory through the anti-symmetrization postulate (or anti-commutation postulate for operators, resp.).

However before plunging deeply into the physical implications of this RST matter dichotomy, one first would like to understand better both the  differences and the common features of both types of RST mixtures from a purely \emph{mathematical} point of view.  In this sense, the present paper presents a detailed study of the geometric and topological properties of both types of mixture configurations, deferring the discussion of the physical implications to a separate treatment. For the purpose of a survey of the corresponding results, it is very instructive to first recall some of the basic (probabilistic) concepts of the conventional quantum theory and oppose these to the analogous kinematical elements of the (fluid-dynamic) RST. Since, on the conventional side, there exists no successful \emph{relativistic} quantum mechanics for many-particle systems (in contrast to the very successful quantum field theory), we have to restrict ourselves here to a comparison of the {\it  non-relativistic} conventional theory with RST (as a fully relativistic theory). Furthermore we are satisfied in the present paper with a treatment of 2-particle  systems (neglecting also the particle spin) which may be sufficient to display already the essential many-particle effects. (For including also the spin into RST see, e.g.~ref.~\cite{MaSo99}).

\subsection{Conventional Quantum Theory}

Since in the conventional theory the 2-particle Hilbert space is the tensor product of the two 1-particle spaces, a \emph{disentangled} 2-particle state~$\Psi(1,2)$ is simply the product of two 1-particles states~$\psi_{{\mathrm{I}}}$ and~$\psi_{{\mathrm{II}}}$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:prod}
  \Psi(1,2) = \psi_{{\mathrm{I}}}(1)\otimes\psi_{{\mathrm{II}}}(2) \; .
\end{equation}
In contrast to this product construction, a disentangled 2-particle state~$\Psi(x)$ in RST is the direct sum of the two 1-particle states
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sum}
  \Psi(x) = \psi_{{\mathrm{I}}}(x)\oplus\psi_{{\mathrm{II}}}(x)\ ,
\end{equation}
or reformulated in mathematical terms: the 2-particle vector bundle (with the RST 2-particle wave function~$\Psi(x)$ as bundle section) is the Whitney sum of both 1-particle bundles. If some interaction between the particles is switched-on (e.g.\ the electromagnetic interactions, especially the static Coulomb interaction) the conventional state~G\ref{eq:prod}) cannot retain its simple product form~G\ref{eq:prod}) but develops into a general 2-particle state~$\Psi_\pm(1,2)$ obeying the symmetrization postulate
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:syp}
  \Psi_\pm(1,2) = \pm\Psi_\pm(2,1)\ .
\end{equation}
In contradiction to certain claims in the older literature, the modern textbooks clearly state that \emph{``this postulate} (expressing the matter dichotomy in the conventional theory) {\it cannot be deduced from other principles of quantum mechanics''} (ref.~\cite{Ba98},~p.~475).

If the interparticle interactions are switched-off again, the generally entangled 2-particle state~$\Psi_\pm$~G\ref{eq:syp}) does not return to the original disentangled form~G\ref{eq:prod}) but develops to a simply entangled state~$\overset{{"
