It is shown that the quantization of a superparticle propagating
in an $N=1$, $D=4$ superspace extended with tensorial coordinates
results in an infinite tower of massless spin states satisfying
the Vasiliev unfolded equations for higher spin fields in flat and
$AdS_4$ $N=1$ superspace. The tensorial extension of the $AdS_4$
superspace is proved to be a supergroup manifold $OSp\,(1|4)$. The
model is manifestly invariant under an $OSp\,(N|8)$ (N=1,2)
superconformal symmetry. As a byproduct, we find that the Cartan
forms of arbitrary $Sp(2n)$ and $OSp(1|2n)$ groups are $GL\,(2n)$
flat, i.e. they are equivalent to flat Cartan forms up to a
$GL\,(2n)$ rotation. This property is crucial for carrying out the
quantization of the particle model on $OSp\,(1|4)$ and getting the
higher spin field dynamics in super $AdS_4$, which can be
performed in a way analogous to the flat case.
