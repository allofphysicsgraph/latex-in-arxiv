  Let $(\dR^n,\CP)$ be a trivially foliated Poisson manifold with
  leaves homeomorphic to $\dR^{n-k}$ where $k=\dim\mathop{\mathrm{ker}}\CP$.  A set of
  representatives of the gauge equivalence classes of solutions to the
  field equations is given by \be X^I(x) = C^I = const. \; , \; \:
  \quad X^\a(x) = 0 = A_\a \; , \quad \; \: A_I = \a_I \; \: \;
  \mbox{with}\; \; [\a_I] \in H^1(\S) \, .  \ee Correspondingly, the
  classical moduli space is found to be of the form: \be
  \label{dimM}{\CM}_{\mathrm{cl}}(\S) = \dR^{k(r+1)} \qquad \mbox{with} \quad \; r
  \equiv \mathop{\mathrm{rank}} H^1(\S) = \mathop{\mathrm{rank}} \pi_1(\S) \quad \mbox{and} \quad k =
  \dim \mathop{\mathrm{ker}} \CP \; .\ee

 For a given map $\CX$ with image in a symplectic leaf $L$ of trivial
 holonomy which has a neighborhood $U$ permitting a presymplectic form
 $\widetilde \O$ compatible with $\CP$, any solution to the field
 equations (\ref{eqs1}), (\ref{eqs2}) may be written in the form \be
 \label{solu}A_i = -\CX^\ast (\partial_i \lrcorner \widetilde \O ) +
 \a_I \; \CX^\ast (\partial_i C^I) \, , \ee where $C^I$,
 $I=1,\ldots,k$, are some Casimir functions with $L = (C^I)^{-1}(0)$
 and $\a_I$ are closed 1-forms on $\S$. For fixed $\widetilde \O$ and
 $C^I$, redefining $\a_I$ by adding an exact 1-form on $\S$ is a gauge
 transformation. For fixed map $\CX$, gauge equivalence classes of
 solutions to the field equations for $A$ correspond to the set of $k$
 elements $[\a_I] \in H^1(\S)$.

  For a given map $\CX$ with image in a symplectic leaf $L$ of trivial
  holonomy which has a neighborhood $U$ permitting a presymplectic
  form $\widetilde \O$ compatible with $\CP$, any solution to the
  field equations \re{eqs1}), \re{eqsnontop}) may be written in the

  functions with $L = (C^I)^{-1}(0)$.

  The $\alpha_I$ form a transversal Lie algebra valued connection on
  the pull back of the conormal bundle of $L$ to $\Sigma$ with
  curvature $\varepsilon_I$. For a fixed map $\CX$, gauge equivalence
  classes of solutions to the field equations for $A$ correspond to
  inequivalent connections of the given curvature on the given line
  bundle on $\Sigma$. All those connections are classified by $k$
  elements of $H^1(\S)$.
