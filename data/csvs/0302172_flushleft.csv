{\footnotesize Fig. 1: The figure shows the BIon spike solution especially when BI electric field $E=0$. The whole configuration carries the angular momentum due to the mechanical rotation, which triggers the electric charge $e_0$ for the BIon. The linear speed is constant $v_0$ everywhere over the configuration.

{\footnotesize Fig. 2: As the D0-branes dissolved in the tube rotate (gray arrows), the fundamental strings (black wiggly arrows) living on the tube are polarized, which results in the electric field induction.

{\footnotesize Fig. 3: The rotating supertube (Left) is T-dual to the spiraling super D-helix (Right). The charge density of the bare fundamental strings (therefore, winding) on the tube gives the momentum to the helix in the dual picture. The rotation of the tube corresponds to the spiral motion of the helix. The pitch of the helix is in a real motion due to the momentum and is, at the same time, in a virtual motion due the spiraling of the helix. The net speed (real plus virtual) amounts to the speed of light.

{\footnotesize Fig. 4: Two tilted D-strings are passing by each other. This configuration is not supersymmetric in general. Only when the boost parameter $\gamma=0$ and the tilting angle $\theta=\pi/2$, the configuration preserve 16 supersymmetries.
