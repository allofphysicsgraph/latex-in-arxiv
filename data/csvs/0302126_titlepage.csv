\begin{abstract}
A velocity of a point particle in the $\k$-Minkowski spacetime is investigated. 
Characteristic points of the spacetime are that the Poincare group becomes a 
quantum group with $\k$, which is a mass dimension parameter, and is a 
kind of non-commutative geometry. We consider a particle in a
coordinate space instead of it in a momentum space which is discussed in many articles. 
We see that the particle's velocity has an uncertainty which depends on a length of  
particle's propagation.
