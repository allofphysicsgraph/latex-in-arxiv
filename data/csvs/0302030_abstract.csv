We investigate the dynamics of a spherically symmetric 3-brane world in the Randall-Sundrum
scenario by taking the point of view of a 5-dimensional observer. To analyze the
Einstein equations in the presence of matter fields in the bulk, we employ a global conformal
transformation whose factor characterizes the $Z_2$ symmetric warp. For a certain kind of conformal
stress-energy tensor and if the warp factor depends only on the fifth dimension, we find a
new set of exact dynamical collapse solutions which localize gravity in the vicinity of the brane.
Geometries inducing the brane world dynamics of inhomogeneous dust and generalized dark radiation
are shown to belong to this set. The conditions for singular or globally regular behavior and
the static marginally bound limits are discussed for these examples. Also explicitly demonstrated
is the complete consistency with the effective point of view of a 4-dimensional observer who
is confined to the brane and makes the same assumptions about the bulk degrees of freedom.
