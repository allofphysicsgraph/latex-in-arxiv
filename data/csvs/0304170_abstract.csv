The Skyrme model is considered using the explicit parametrization
of the rotation group ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ by elements of its algebra.
Topologically nontrivial solutions arise even in the one-dimensional
case because the fundamental group of the group ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ is equal
to ${\mathbb Z}_2$. Static one-dimensional solutions are found explicitly
and analyzed. There are topologically nontrivial solutions with finite
energy among them. New class of projective models is proposed with a
target space which is an arbitrary real projective space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d$.
