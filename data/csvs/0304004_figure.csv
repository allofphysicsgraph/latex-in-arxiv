\caption{\label{figure1} On the left (a), the shaded region indicates
the part of the $(\gamma,\xi)$ plane for which the potential $V(A)$
has the form displayed on the right (b), with the supplemental
condition $|w|\leq1$; the vertical line is related to the string frame
behavior (see section \ref{substring}). The case $d=3$ has been
displayed, the other cases being qualitatively analogous.}
