We provide a simple low energy description of recombination of
intersecting D-branes using super Yang-Mills theory. The recombination
is realized by condensation of an off-diagonal 
tachyonic fluctuation localized at the intersecting point.
The recombination process is equivalent to brane-antibrane annihilation,
thus our result confirms Sen's conjecture on tachyon condensation, 
although we work in the super Yang-Mills theory whose energy scale is
much lower than $\alpha'$. We also discuss the decay width of
non-parallelly separated D-branes.
