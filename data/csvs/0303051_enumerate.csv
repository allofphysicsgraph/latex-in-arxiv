\item[(i).] Our world-sheet theory consists of $d$ free bosons $ X^{\mu} $ and fermions $\psi^{\mu}\; (\mu = 0,\cdots ,d-1)$ with signature $ (1, d-1) $ and a unitary SCFT $ K $ of central charge $ \hat{c}_{K} = 10-d $ ($ \hat{c} = 2c/3 $). Although we focus on the $d=1$ case below, the extension to $1 \leq d \leq 10$ is straightforward.
%
\item[(ii).] 
We assume that $K$ is unitary and that all states in $K$ lie in highest weight representations. From the Kac determinant (App.~\ref{sec:appC}), the weight of a highest weight state has $h^{K} > 0$ in the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sector and $h^{K} > \hat{c}_{K}/16$ in the Ramond (R) sector. An example of $K$ is a compact unitary SCFT, where its spectrum is discrete and bounded below. Another example is the transverse SCFT.
%Comment: 
%For compact unitary CFT, all states lie in hw reps. However, we do not restrict to compact CFTs. So, ""unitary"" and ""that all states in $K$ lie in highest weight representations"" are different statements. 
%Also, a compact CFT always has a unit operator with \hk=0. So, for a compact case, we'd better include it. It is not inconsistent with Kac determinant; it simply means that the reps with \hk=0 are degenerate, and there is still no null state. Note that the positivity of Kac determinant is a sufficient condition for unitarity, and not a necessary condition. Thus, it's fine to include the unit operator. Now, for a noncompact CFT, even \ket{1} may not be normalizable. So, it is not clear whether we should or we can include it. Anyway, the condition we need is \hk>0. Otherwise, the infrared state is included, which does violate the no-ghost thm.
%
\item[(iii).] The momentum of states is $k^{\mu} \neq 0$.
