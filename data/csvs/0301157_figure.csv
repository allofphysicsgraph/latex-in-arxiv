\caption{Sketch of the quantum parameter space $\mq$ for gauge group $\uuu$. The
sheets are labeled by a state $|k_{1},k_{2};N_{1},N_{2}\rangle$ and
parametrized by $\la$ (if $N_{1}N_{2}=0$) or by
$\sqrt{\la}$ (if $N_{1}N_{2}\not =0$). The cross
denotes the classical $\la =0$ points. The black dots represent
singularities with a massless monopole that are found for
$\sqrt{\la} = 2\sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi q/3}/3$, $q$ integer. 
Each singularity of that type link three sheets, and
the gray lines represent the corresponding three-fold indentification.
The black squares at $\la = e^{-2i\pi k/3}$ represent
singularities with a massless glueball. They are the three branching
points of the three cuts joining the sheets $|k,0;3,0\rangle$ and
$|0,k;0,3\rangle$.

\caption{Sketch of the quantum parameter space $\mq$ for gauge group 
$\uuuu$. The sheets are parametrized by $\la$ or $\la^{1/3}$. The
dots, squares and stars represent singularities with a massless
monopole (at $\la = (4/5)e^{-ik\pi /2}$), a massless glueball (at
$\la^{1/3}=(3^{1/4}/2^{1/6})e^{-ik\pi/6}$), or both (at $\la =
e^{-ik\pi/2}$), respectively. Due to the complexity of the diagram, we
have not been able to represent explicitly all the identifications
between sheets. It is understood that singularities and branch cuts
with the same label are identified.
