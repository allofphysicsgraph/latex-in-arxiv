Some recent studies have considered  a  Randall-Sundrum-like
 brane world evolving in the background of an anti-de Sitter
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole.  
For this scenario, it has been
shown
that, when the bulk charge is non-vanishing, 
a singularity-free ``bounce'' universe
will always be obtained. However, for  the physically relevant  case of a  
de Sitter brane world, we have recently argued
that, from a holographic ($c$-theorem)
perspective, such brane worlds may not be physically
viable. In the current paper, we reconsider
the validity of such models by appealing to
the so-called ``causal entropy bound''.  In this framework,
a paradoxical outcome is obtained:
these brane worlds are  indeed holographically  viable, 
provided that the bulk  charge 
is not too small. We go on to argue that this new finding
is likely the more reliable one.
