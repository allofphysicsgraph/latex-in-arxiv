We discuss the application of the method of characteristics to the 
renormalization-group equation for the perturbative QCD series within 
the electron-positron annihilation cross-section.  We demonstrate how
one such renormalization-group improvement of this series is equivalent
to a closed-form summation of the first four towers of 
renormalization-group accessible logarithms to all orders of 
perturbation theory.
