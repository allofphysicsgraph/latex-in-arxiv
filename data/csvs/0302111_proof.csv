    Homomorphisms in this category are trace-preserving. So, for $a\in
    A$ and $b\in B$,
    \[
    \tau_B[v(a)b] = \tau_B\left[v(a\,v^{-1}(b))\right]
    = \tau_A[a\,v^{-1}(b)]
    \mbox.\]
    Thus $v^{-1}=v^\dagger$.

1,"\begin{proof}
Let $C\subset B$ be the subspace spanned by the
$B_k$'s.  By the hypothesis, for any $a\in A$, $[\beta,a]_-$ must be
orthogonal\footnote{We are using the structure of $B$ as a Hilbert space.} to every $B_k$, and thus to $C$. Hence for any $c\in C$,
\[
0 = \tau(c[\beta,a]_-) = \tau (\beta [a,c]_-)
\mbox.\]
So $\beta\in [A,C]^\perp$. We need to
show that $[A,C]^\perp\subseteq A'$ (the commutant of $A$). The
orthogonal complement of $A'$ is $[A,A]$, so we simply need to prove
that $[A,A]\subseteq [A,C]$.

$C$ is closed as a Lie algebra and acts unitarily on $B$ by $\ad$.
$C$ generates $B$ as an algebra, therefore the only part of $B$
commuting with $C$ is the center, $\co\subset B$.  This is thus the
only trivial $C$-subrepresentation in $B$, and so $[B,C]=[B,B]$.
$[A,C]=\ad_C(A)$ is the sum of the nontrivial irreducible
$C$-representations which intersect with $A$.  Thus indeed
$[A,A]\subseteq [A,C]$, and the claim is proven.

Let $H:=\{h\in \Aut B \mid j_k^\dagger\circ h\circ\iota=
j_k^\dagger\circ\iota\; \forall k\}$ be the subgroup that leaves the
reductions of $\iota$ invariant and $B^H$ the subalgebra of
$H$-invariant elements.  $\Aut A'\subset\Aut B$ leaves $\iota$
invariant, so $\Aut A'\subseteq H$ and $B^H\subseteq B^{\Aut A'} = A$.
$H$ is compact, so we can define the orthogonal projection $p:B\onto
B^H\subset B$.  This is constructed by averaging over $H$.  Each map
$j_k^\dagger\circ\iota$ factors through $p$,
\[
j_k^\dagger\circ\iota = j_k^\dagger\circ p\circ\iota
\mbox.\]

Let $\beta\in A$ be any element commuting with $B^H$.
 For any $a\in A$ and $b\in B^H$,
\[
\tau(b[\beta,a]_-)=\tau(a[b,\beta]_-)=0
\mbox,\]
so $p\circ\ad_\beta=0$.
Thus
\[
j_k^\dagger\circ\ad_\beta\circ\iota = j_k^\dagger\circ\iota\circ\ad_\beta = j_k^\dagger\circ
p\circ\iota\circ\ad_\beta = j_k^\dagger\circ p\circ\ad_\beta\circ \iota =0
\mbox.\]
Therefore $\beta\in A\cap A' =\co$.
This implies that $B^H=A$.

Any other homomorphism can be written as $\alpha\circ\iota$
with $\alpha\in\Aut B$.  If this is distinct from $\iota$ then
$\alpha\not\in\Aut A$, but if $\alpha\circ\iota$ has the same
reductions as $\iota$ then $\alpha\in H$.  We would then have $H$
larger than just $\Aut A'$ and thus $B^H$ would have to be a \emph{proper}
subalgebra of $A$.

3,"\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{main}]
Lemma \ref{reconstruction} implies the uniqueness of the $\m_{\mathrm
P}(\xi,y)$ in Axiom 1. If $\xi$ is a complete past of $\zeta$, then if
a homomorphism $\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,\zeta):\A(\zeta)\to\A(\xi)$ exists
with the $\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,z)$'s (for $z\in\zeta$) as its reductions, it can be
reconstructed by multiplying the $\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,z)$'s together,
so $\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,\zeta)$ is unique. Conversely,
because of Axiom 2, we \emph{can} multiply together the $\m_{\mathrm
P}(\xi,z)$'s to define $\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,\zeta)$.

Analogously, for $\zeta$ a complete future of $\xi$, a unique map
$\m_{\mathrm F}(\xi,\zeta)$ exists, satisfying the requirements of
Property 3.

Suppose that both of these are true.  That is, $\xi\preceq\zeta$ is a
complete pair.  We need to show that $\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,\zeta) =
\m_{\mathrm F}(\xi,\zeta)$ and is an isomorphism.

Because all homomorphisms in this category are injective, the
existence of homomorphisms in both directions between $\A(\xi)$ and
$\A(\zeta)$ shows that they are of equal dimension and therefore
isomorphic. These homomorphisms must therefore be isomorphisms.

So, $\m^\dagger_{\mathrm F}(\xi,\zeta)$ is an isomorphism, and by
Theorem~\ref{unitary}, $\m_{\mathrm F}(\xi,\zeta)$ is its inverse.
The reductions of $\m_{\mathrm F}(\xi,\zeta)$ are the same as for
$\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,\zeta)$ and as it is a homomorphism, the above
uniqueness implies $\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,\zeta) = \m_{\mathrm
F}(\xi,\zeta)$.

Now suppose that $\xi\preceq\upsilon\preceq\zeta$. Let $x\in\xi$ and $y\in\zeta$. By what we have proven so far, $\m_{\mathrm F}(x,\upsilon)$ is a reduction of $\m(\xi,\upsilon)$. By Axiom 3, $\m(x,y) = \m_{\mathrm F}(x,\upsilon)\circ\m_{\mathrm P}(\upsilon,y)$. So, $\m(x,y)$ is a reduction of $\m(\xi,\upsilon)\circ\m_{\mathrm P}(\upsilon,y)$. By Lemma \ref{reconstruction}, since the reductions are the same, we must have that $\m_{\mathrm P}(\xi,y) = \m(\xi,\upsilon)\circ\m_{\mathrm P}(\upsilon,y)$. Using Lemma \ref{reconstruction} again, this shows that $\m(\xi,\upsilon)\circ \m(\upsilon,\zeta)=\m(\xi,\zeta)$.
