  Brane inflation in superstring theory predicts that cosmic strings 
  (but not domain walls or monopoles) are produced towards the end 
  of the   inflationary epoch. Here, we discuss the production, the
  spectrum and the evolution of such cosmic strings, properties
  that differentiate them from those coming from an abelian Higgs
  model. As D-branes in extra dimensions, some type of cosmic 
  strings will dissolve rapidly in spacetime, while the stable 
  ones appear with a spectrum of cosmic string tensions. Moreover, 
  the presence of the extra dimensions reduces the interaction 
  rate of the cosmic strings in some scenarios, resulting 
  in an order of magnitude enhancement of the number/energy density 
  of the cosmic string network when compared to the field theory case.
