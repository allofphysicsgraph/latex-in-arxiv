\item[(S1)] There are no perturbative open string excitations around
this solution, which is hence also known as the ``closed string vacuum of
open string field theory''.
\item[(S2)] The energy difference between the solution with open strings
and the closed string vacuum is exactly equal to the D-brane tension computed
in perturbative string theory.

\item[(S3)] If the initial configuration is an unstable brane configuration
of non-zero codimension (say a D$p$-brane in bosonic string theory with
$p<25$) then the energy stays localized in the plane of the original
brane, in other words, energy is not carried away from this plane by
classical radiation.
\item[(S4)] When computing the energy-momentum tensor of the solution
on finds that, asymptotically for late times, the energy density of 
the solution is constant (in the plane of the original brane) and the 
pressure vanishes exponentially in time.
