Introduction, and is governed by a non-trivial base space geometry of the 
Calabi-Yau threefold. For example, consider 
a two-dimensional locus with an $SU(n)$ singularity and another 
locus with an $SU(m)$ singularity. If they intersect or meet at a point, the
(mixed) wrapped two-cycles give rise to bi-fundamental
matter of the $SU(n) \otimes SU(m)$ gauge group in four dimensions.
This extends readily to multiple intersecting loci.
It was also indicated in the Introduction how the associated toric quiver 
diagrams of $N=2$ QFT$_4$'s are similar
to the usual Dynkin diagrams of ordinary and affine Lie algebras. 



\section{Geometric engineering of $N=1$ gauge theory}


Here we discuss a straightforward way of elevating the geometric 
engineering of $N=2$ gauge models in string theory to a similar 
construction of $N=1$ gauge models in M-theory. 
Alternative studies of four-dimensional $N=1$ gauge models in the
framework of F- or M-theory may be found in refs. \cite{V,acha,FW}.


\subsection{Outline of method}


The method we will be using here is quite similar to the   
geometric engineering of $N=2$ QFT$_4$ discussed above. 
Our starting point is a local description of M-theory 
compactification on a $G_2$ manifold with K3 fibration over  
a real three-dimensional base space $B_3$. In this way, the 
scenario of type IIA superstring theory in six dimensions appears in seven 
dimensions in M-theory. The D2-branes are 
replaced by M2-branes, and we obtain an $N=2$ gauge 
theory in seven dimensions. If we compactify this seven-dimensional theory   
on $T^3$ to four dimensions, we obtain an $N=4$ gauge theory, while
a compactification on $S^2\times S^1$ leads to a system 
with eight supercharges (corresponding to $N=2$) \cite{acha}.

We are, however, interested in models with only four supercharges in four 
dimensions, i.e., $N=1$ QFT$_4$. 
In order to reach such a model we need to compactify on a manifold 
whose three-dimensional base preserves $1/4$ of the remaining 
16 supercharges. The seven-dimensional K3 fibration must also 
have vanishing first Betti number, $b_1=0$, to meet the requirement
of $G_2$ holonomy. An example of such a geometry has the 
three-dimensional sphere $S^3$ as base, in which case we obtain only 
{\em pure} $N=1$ Yang-Mills theory \cite{acha,FW}.
We shall, instead, consider (a collection of) non-trivial $S^2$
fibrations over a finite line segment. 

As in the $N=2$ case, the incorporation of   
matter may be achieved by introducing a non-trivial geometry in the 
base of the K3 fibration. This leads us to consider
a three-dimensional intersecting geometry to describe a product
gauge group with bi-fundamental matter.


\subsection{Construction of the base geometry}


Our construction of the non-trivial base geometry $B_3$ is quite simple
and motivated by recent work on Lagrangian submanifolds in Calabi-Yau 
manifolds \cite{GVW}. We shall consider the three-dimensional base space
as a two-dimensional fibration over a one-dimensional base, where 
the fiber and the base each preserves half of the 
seven-dimensional M-theory  supercharges. The entire base space $B_3$
is embedded in a three-dimensional complex Calabi-Yau manifold.
As discussed below, this ensures that the elements of the intersection matrix
of a collection of such base space constituents are integers.
The Calabi-Yau manifolds are realized explicitly as a family of (deformed)
$ADE$ singular K3 surfaces over the complex plane. 
This geometry extends the family of elliptic curves on the complex plane 
used in F-theory compactifications down to eight dimensions \cite{Vafa96}.
In this way, non-trivial three-cycles, satisfying the 
constraints of the $G_2$ base geometry, constitute an 
intersecting geometry of $ADE$ K3 surfaces fibered over a line segment  
in the complex plane. The ``$ADE$ part'' corresponds to a two-dimensional
geometry obtained by resolving the $ADE$ singularities of the K3 surfaces. 
As already mentioned, the $ADE$ geometry is then either an (i)
ordinary (finite Lie algebraic) $ADE$ geometry, or an (ii) 
affine (infinite Lie algebraic) $ADE$ geometry.

We start by examining the model with an ordinary 
$A_1$ singularity in the K3 fiber. This is subsequently extended
to more general $ADE$ geometries. The deformed $A_1$ geometry 
is given by 
\be
 z_1^2+z_2^2+z_3^2= \mu 
\label{mu}
\ee 
where $\mu$ is a complex parameter. The real part of this parameter, 
being the radius squared of the sphere, is related to the FI terms 
(\ref{U}) and (\ref{S}), while the imaginary part can be identified 
with the NS-NS $B$-field in superstring compactifications. The $A_1$ 
threefolds may be obtained by varying the parameter $\mu$ over 
the complex plane parametrized by $w$:
\be
 z_1^2+z_2^2+z_3^2= \mu(w).
\ee 
The base space $B_3$ can then be viewed as a finite line segment with an 
$S^2$ fibration, where the radius $r$ of $S^2$ vanishes at the two interval 
end points, and at the end points only \cite{HI}. The latter requirement
ensures that no unwanted singularities are introduced.
One way to realize this geometry is 
\be 
 r\ \sim\ \sin x
\label{r}
\ee
where $x$ is a real variable parameterizing the interval $\[0,\pi\]$ 
in the $w$-plane. 

This construction may be extended to more general $ADE$
geometries where we have intersecting  spheres according to affine $ADE$
Dynkin diagrams. Here we consider a general model describing
a family of deformed elliptic $ADE$ singularities of K3
surfaces fibered over the complex plane, and their mirror partners in type II
superstring compactifications.
In type IIB superstring theory, the blow-up of these
singularities can be described in a two-dimensional $N=2$ linear sigma model 
with $U(1)^{\otimes(r+1)}$ gauge symmetry. It has $r+5$ chiral
multiplets $\phi_\ell$ with vector charges $q^i_\ell$, where $r$ is the
rank of the associated affine $ADE$ Lie algebra.
The $D$-terms corresponding to such classical vacua are given by
\be
 U=\sum\limits _{i=1}^{r+1}\sum \limits _{\ell=1}^{r+5}(q_\ell^i
  |\phi_\ell|^2-R_i)^2,
\ee 
where the FI terms are denoted $R_i$.
The $q^i_\ell$'s, being  the quantum charges of $\phi_\ell$ 
under the $U(1)^{\otimes(r+1)}$ gauge symmetry, are identified
with the intersection matrix (known as Mori vectors in toric geometry) 
of the non-compact and compact divisors of the elliptic $ADE$ K3 surfaces.
For the compact divisors\footnote{We shall be using a convention where the
first $r+1$ divisors are compact, i.e., $q^j_1,\ldots,q^j_{r+1}$ 
correspond to the compact divisors.} used in the resolution of the elliptic  
$ADE$ singularities, the intersection numbers are given by minus
the affine $ADE$ Cartan matrix $K$:
\be
  q_i^j=-K_{ij}, \quad i,j=1,\ldots,r+1.
\ee 
This link stems from a nice correspondence between the $ADE$ roots   
and the two-cycles, $C$, involved in the deformation of the elliptic 
singularities of the K3 surfaces \cite{KMV}. In this way, the cohomology 
class of the deformed elliptic curve, $T^2$, is represented by
 \be
 [T^2]=\sum_{i=1}^{r+1} s_i C_i,
\label{TC}
\ee
where $s_i$ are the Coxeter labels of the affine Lie algebra. 

The elliptic $ADE$ threefolds
may now be described using the toric geometry data of these threefolds
and local mirror symmetry \cite{Mayr,BFS,BS}. Applying this symmetry
in the K3 fiber, the elliptic $ADE$ type IIA mirror geometries, 
$ X^{\ast }$, may be described by an algebraic geometry equation of the form
\be
 P\left( X^{\ast }\right)=\sum_{\ell=1}^{r+5}a_{\ell} (w)y_{\ell}.
\label{210}
\ee
$a_{\ell}=a_{\ell}(w)$ are varying complex 
moduli\footnote{Note that only $r+1$ of these are physical.} in the $w$-plane,
while the $y_{\ell}$'s are complex variables satisfying
\be
  \prod\limits_{\ell=1}^{r+5}y_{\ell}^{q_{\ell}^{i}}=1, \quad
  \forall\; i=1,\ldots,r+1.
\label{mirror}
\ee
This defines the mirror elliptic $ADE$ K3  fiber. Eq. (\ref{mirror}) can be
solved by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial in some variables $(x,y,z,v)$, and 
eq. (\ref{210}) becomes
\be
 p_0(x,y,z;\lambda (w))+\sum_{i=1}^{r+1}
  p_i(x,y,z,v;a_i(w))=0.
\ee
Here $\left(x,y,z\right)$ are the homogeneous coordinates of
the weighted projective space ${WP}^{2}_{3,2,1}$, while the index on
$a_i$ refers to a (physical) compact divisor. Parameterized by the
complex structure modulus $\lambda$,
$p_0=0$ now describes a family of elliptic curves over the $w$-plane:
\be
 x^2+y^3+z^6+ \lambda (w) xyz=0.
\ee
The $v$-dependent term depends on the structure of the affine Lie
algebra. In particular, the powers of the complex variable $v$
appearing in the $ADE$ mirror geometries are given by the Coxeter labels
of the corresponding affine Lie algebra. The geometry of affine $A_{2}$, for 
instance, is given by
\be
 x^{2}+y^{3}+z^{6}+ \lambda (w) xyz+v\[ a_1(w)z^{3}+a_2(w) yz+a_3(w)x\]=0.
\ee

A similar analysis of the simple $A_1$ model discussed in eqs.
(\ref{mu})-(\ref{r}) could be done using the 
so-called mirror map in the Calabi-Yau moduli spaces \cite{KMV}. 
Indeed, mirror symmetry relates the complixified FI terms 
$T_j$ in type IIB geometry $X$ to the coordinates, $Z_j$, of the 
complex moduli space of type IIA geometry:
\be
 T_j=B_j+iV(C_j)\ \sim\ -i\ln(Z_j).
\label{map}
\ee
$V(C_j)$ is the volume of the two-cycle $C_j$, whereas $Z_j$ is given by 
\be
 Z_j=\prod\limits_{\ell=1}^{r+5}a_{\ell}^{q_{\ell}^{j}}.
\ee
For vanishing integrated NS-NS $B$-fields $B_j$, equation (\ref{map}) 
reduces to 
\be
 V(C_j)\ \sim\ -\ln(Z_j).
\label{rmap}
\ee
Under mirror symmetry, the constraints on the K\""ahler 
parameters of the two-cycles in type IIB geometry translate 
into conditions on the complex structures in type IIA geometry.
 
In the geometric setting, our choice of base geometry is given as a 
line segment fibered by intersecting 
spheres according to $ADE$ affine Dynkin diagrams.


\section{Gauge group and matter content}


Having specified the base geometry of the $G_2$ manifold, we  
will discuss the corresponding gauge theory of the compactified
M-theory. Our analysis here will be  based 
on a dual type IIA  superstring description. It turns out that, in addition 
to being dual to heterotic string compactification, M-theory 
on $G_2$ manifolds is also dual to type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau 
threefolds in the presence of D6-branes wrapping Lagrangian sub-manifolds 
and filling the four-dimensional Minkowski space \cite{CSU}.  
In particular, a local description of M-theory near the $A_{n-1}$ singularity 
of K3 surfaces is equivalent to $n$ units of D6-branes \cite{LV}. 
Indeed, on the seven-dimensional world-volume of each D6-brane 
we have a $U(1)$ symmetry. When the $n$ D6-branes approach each other,
the gauge symmetry is enhanced from $U(1)^{\otimes n}$ to $U(n)$. 
An extra compactification of M-theory down to four-dimensional 
space-time is equivalent to wrapping D6-branes on the same geometry.
In this way, the physics content of the resulting D6-brane scenario can be 
computed explicitly using the method of the so-called $(p,q)$ webs 
\cite{HI,FHHI,FH,Uranga,CIM}. Using the results of this method,
we expect that the final gauge theory in four-dimensional Minkowski space
has gauge group
\be
 G\ =\ \bigotimes_{i=1}^m U(n_i).
\ee 
$m$ is the number of intersecting three-cycles in the base geometry.
The integers $n_i$ are specified by the anomaly cancellation 
condition. This means that they should form 
a null vector of the intersection matrix of the three-cycles:  
\be
 \sum_{j=1}^mI_{ij}n_j\ =\ 0.
\label{acc}
\ee 
In the infra-red limit the $U(1)$ factors decouple and one is left 
with the gauge group
\be
 G\ =\ \bigotimes_{i=1}^m SU(n_i).
\ee 

As already mentioned, the gauge group and matter content depend on the 
intersecting geometry in the three-dimensional base of the $G_2$ manifold. 
The intersection matrix of real $N$-dimensional spheres $S^N$ 
(constructed as blow-ups of singularities in Calabi-Yau spaces) 
is symmetric for $N$ even and anti-symmetric for $N$ odd. 
In more general geometries, the intersection matrix may be written as a 
linear combination of a symmetric and an anti-symmetric term.

Here we identify the base with a collection of
the three-cycles discussed in Section 3. We recall that they correspond 
to $S^2$ fibrations over a line segment. Thus, the intersection matrix of 
the three-cycles is equivalent to the intersection
matrix formed by two-spheres only. From the obvious similarity
with the $N=2$ scenario discussed in Section 2, we see that 
information on our intersecting geometry is naturally encoded
in the Cartan matrix, $K$, of an affine $ADE$ Lie algebra:
\be
 I_{ij}=-K_{ij}.
\ee
It follows that the anomaly cancellation condition is translated into 
a condition on the affine Lie algebra, thus solving (\ref{acc}) by
\be
 n_i=s_in.
\ee
Here $s_i$, $i=1,\dots,r+1$, are the Coxeter labels of the associated
affine Lie algebra of rank $r$, and $r+1$ is equal to the number of 
intersecting three-cycles. As in (\ref{SUsin}), $n$ is an unspecified positive
integer. The gauge group finally reads
\be
 G\ =\ \bigotimes_{i=1}^{r+1} SU(s_in).
\ee 
 

\section{Conclusion}


We have studied the geometric engineering of $N=1$
four-dimensional models from M-theory on a manifold with
$G_2$ holonomy. This manifold is a K3 fibration over a 
three-dimensional base space with $ADE$ geometry. To that
end we have first constructed the base geometry as 
intersecting two-cycles over a line segment. This special base
has been embedded in a family of K3 surfaces over the complex
plane. Based on the relation between M-theory and D6-branes 
in type IIA superstrings, we have discussed the physics content of 
M-theory compactified on our $G_2$ manifold. In particular,
the resulting gauge theory has been discussed in the framework
of $(p,q)$ webs. In this scenario, the anomaly cancellation
condition was seen to translate into a condition on the associated 
affine Lie algebra.
