We obtain the exact non-perturbative solution of a
scalar field theory defined on a space with noncommuting position and momentum
coordinates. The model describes non-locally interacting charged
particles in a background magnetic field. It is an exactly solvable
quantum field theory which has non-trivial interactions only when it
is defined with a finite ultraviolet cutoff. We propose that
small perturbations of this theory can produce solvable models with
renormalizable interactions.

Quantum field theories on noncommutative spaces have received a surge
of interest in recent years, primarily because they can be obtained as
limits of string theory with background magnetic fields in which the
massive string modes decouple (see~\cite{ks} for reviews and
exhaustive lists of references). They capture many of the non-local
effects possessed by string theory but in a much simpler setting, and
have attained a fundamental level of interest as examples of non-local
field theories which may be well-defined. Various versions of them
have also been proposed as effective field theory descriptions of some
planar condensed matter systems in strong magnetic fields, such as
quantum Hall models. Because of their embedding into string theory,
these models are sometimes believed to be unitary and
renormalizable.\footnote{Disclaimer: Views and opinions mentioned in
  this letter do not necessarily reflect those of the authors.} However,
they possess several unusual aspects which continue to challenge the
conventional wisdom of quantum field theory, and question the
renormalizability and overall consistency of these field theories.

On a canonical noncommutative space, the usual pointwise product of fields
is replaced by the star-product
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi\star\Phi'(x)=\int\frac{\dd^Dk~\dd^Dq}{(2\pi)^D}~\tilde\Phi(k)\,
\tilde\Phi'(q)~\e^{\ii k_\mu\,\theta^{\mu\nu}\,q_\nu}~\e^{\ii(k+q)
\cdot x} \ ,
\label{starproddef}\end{eqnarray}
where the tildes denote Fourier transforms and $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ is a
constant antisymmetric matrix.
The noncommutativity of space is encoded in the
fact that the commutators of coordinates computed with this
product are non-vanishing, as $x^\mu\star
x^\nu=x^\mu\,x^\nu+\ii\theta^{\mu\nu}$. In perturbation theory, the
phases in (\ref{starproddef}) produce momentum dependent vertices in
Feynman diagrams which affect the interactions of the quantum field
theory at energy scales below the scale $1/\sqrt{|\theta|}$ set by the
dimensionful noncommutativity parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. The most
drastic example of this is known as
ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. If one uses Fourier expansion of
fields in a basis of plane waves $\e^{\ii p\cdot x}$, as in
(\ref{starproddef}), then the natural regularization of the quantum
field theory is the restriction of momenta $p$ to an annulus
$\Lambda_0<|p|<\Lambda$, where $\Lambda_0$ is an IR cutoff and
$\Lambda$ a UV cutoff. Removing the cutoffs amounts to
taking the limits $\Lambda_0\to0$ and $\Lambda\to\infty$. Planar
diagrams essentially coincide with those of ordinary quantum field
theory, while non-planar graphs are modified by phases containing
internal and external line momenta and are generically convergent. The
rapid phase oscillations in (\ref{starproddef}) imply that a
high-momentum cutoff $\Lambda$ generates an effective IR cutoff
$\Lambda_0=1/|\theta|\Lambda$. This appears to ruin the
usual Wilsonian renormalization procedure which would require a clear
separation of high and low momentum scales.

However, the puzzling UV/IR mixing properties may simply be an
artifact of perturbation theory which disappears when summed to all
orders. This is a non-perturbative issue which is in general
difficult to address. In this letter we will formulate a
noncommutative scalar field theory which is exactly solvable and obtain its
non-perturbative solution explicitly. The model describes charged
scalar particles in a background magnetic field with a four-point
interaction defined by the star-product~\cite{LS}. We will circumvent the
problems set in by UV/IR mixing by using a basis for the expansion of
fields on ${\bb R}^D$ which differs from the more conventional plane
wave basis and which will allow us to make sense of the field theory at a
fully non-perturbative level. This expansion provides a natural
non-perturbative regularization of the quantum field theory, producing
both a short-distance and low-momentum cutoff
simultaneously. We will show how to extract from this the exact
expressions for Green's functions of the quantum field theory.

The model is defined by the Euclidean action
\begin{eqnarray}
S=\int\dd^2 x~\left[\Phi^*\left(H_B+m^2\right)\Phi+\frac g2\,
\Phi^*\star\Phi\star\Phi^*\star\Phi\right] \ ,
\label{Bmodelaction}\end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi$ is a charged scalar field on flat space ${\bb R}^2$ and
\begin{eqnarray}
H_B=\left(-\ii\partial_\mu-B\,\epsilon_{\mu\nu}\,x^\nu\right)^2
\label{LandauHam}\end{eqnarray}
is the Landau Hamiltonian for a charged particle moving in two
dimensions under the influence of a constant perpendicularly applied
magnetic field $2B>0$. For brevity, we will only work in $D=2$
dimensions. The noncommutativity parameter is then given by
$\theta^{\mu\nu}=\theta\,\epsilon^{\mu\nu}$. Because the commutators
of the covariant momentum operators
$-\ii\partial_\mu-B\,\epsilon_{\mu\nu}\,x^\nu$ are equal to $-2\ii
B\,\epsilon_{\mu\nu}$, we may interpret the field theory
(\ref{Bmodelaction}) as being defined on a noncommutative space whose
corresponding momentum space is also given by noncommuting
coordinates. However, the ensuing analysis carries through to arbitrary even
dimensionality~\cite{langmann,inprep}, and remarkably most of our
conclusions hold quite generally. This follows from the fact that in
any even dimension $D$ there is a choice of coordinates which
skew-diagonalizes the problem into a product of $D/2$ two-dimensional
ones, to which the analysis of this letter applies with the
appropriate changes. The details will be presented in a separate
publication~\cite{inprep}.

We shall find that the UV fixed point of this theory is
trivial. The only scaling limit possible is one in which the coupling
constant $g$ vanishes as the UV cutoff is removed. We shall find that
there is no intermediate scale in between the two natural UV and IR
cutoffs in this model, consistent with the UV/IR
duality found in~\cite{LS}, and the field theory is not renormalizable
because the fields are correlated on the scale of the cutoff. This
result is similar in spirit to earlier observations that asymptotically-free
noncommutative field theories are trivial \cite{Akhmedov:2000uz}, and
that generic ones are only well-defined when they contain
both a finite UV and IR cutoff~\cite{amns}.
The renormalized propagator as an exact function of
external momentum is given in the scaling limit by
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde G(p)=\frac{\sqrt{(p^2+m^2)^2+4M^4}-(p^2+m^2)}{2M^4} \ ,
\label{Grenpexact}\end{eqnarray}
where $m$ is the bare scalar particle mass and $M$ is a dynamically
generated mass scale. The non-free form of (\ref{Grenpexact}) takes
into account a non-perturbative resummation of leading power
divergences in the scaling limit which are generated by the
degeneracies of the Landau levels. Such a renormalization procedure,
though formally consistent, is physically  meaningless and has little chance to
 produce an interacting quantum field theory in the scaling limit. The
 scalar field theory is thereby an example of a noncommutative field
 theory, with a finite cutoff, which is exactly solvable. The exact
 propagator at finite cutoff, which is computed below, produces
 (\ref{Grenpexact}) in the scaling limit and has a qualitatively
 similar but somewhat more complicated form. It exhibits a novel
 oscillatory behaviour in position space on top of its long-distance
 exponential decay, which may be attributed to
 the appearence of an Aharonov-Bohm phase acquired by the charged
 particles in the magnetic background, similar to those observed
 numerically in~\cite{bhn}. Slight modifications of the model, such as
 the inclusion of a background harmonic oscillator potential that
 lifts the Landau level degeneracy, may produce good scaling limits.

Because of the magnetic field in the action,
a natural basis of normal modes
 is comprised of the orthonormal eigenfunctions
$\phi_{\ell,n}$ of the Landau Hamiltonian (\ref{LandauHam}),
\begin{eqnarray}
H_B\phi_{\ell,n}=4B\left(\mbox{$\ell-\frac12$}\right)\,\phi_{\ell,n} \ ,
\label{Landaueigen}\end{eqnarray}
with $\ell,n$ positive integers. Some properties of the Landau
eigenfunctions $\phi_{\ell,n}$ are briefly described in an appendix at
the end of this letter. These wavefunctions form the position space
representation of the occupation
number states $|\ell,n\rangle$ of two decoupled harmonic oscillators,
and with them we can expand the complex scalar fields of
(\ref{Bmodelaction}) as
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi(x)=\sqrt{4\pi\theta}~\mbox{$\sum_{\ell,n}$}\,A^{~}_{\ell n}~
\phi_{\ell,n}^*(x)
\label{Landauexp}\end{eqnarray}
with $\phi_{\ell,n}^*=\phi_{n,\ell}^{~}$ and $A_{\ell n}$ dimensionless
complex numbers.

In this basis, the free part of the action (\ref{Bmodelaction}) is
diagonal, but the four-point star-product interaction term is
rather complicated. However, a special simplification occurs when the
parameters of the model are related through $B=1/\theta$.
In this case, the Landau wavefunctions have a remarkably simple
behaviour under star-products, $\phi_{\ell,n}\star\phi_{\ell',n'}=
\delta_{n\ell'}\,\phi_{\ell,n'}/\sqrt{4\pi\theta}$, which
can be derived by an explicit calculation and reflects the
fact that the one-particle wavefunctions
$\sqrt{4\pi\theta}\,\phi_{\ell,n}$ form the Wigner representations
of the Fock space operators $|\ell\rangle\langle n|$. As we show below,
the quantum field theory defined by (\ref{Bmodelaction}) is exactly
solvable precisely when the magnetic field and noncommutativity
parameter are related in this way, and we shall assume this
relation for the remainder of this letter. The action
(\ref{Bmodelaction}) then takes the simple form
\begin{eqnarray}
