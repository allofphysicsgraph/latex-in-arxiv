At this stage, there are two possible ways to proceed.
${}$For any Feynman graph,
the momentum integrals
in {\it all} kernels (\ref {dKernel})  can either be
(i) left to the end of calculation; or
(ii) carried out first.
These choices give rise to two different {\it manifestly} covariant
perturbation schemes: (i) momentum space scheme;
(ii) configuration space scheme. In our opinion,
the former is most suitable for arbitrary backgrounds,
while the latter is better adapted to special background
configurations such as a covariantly constant field.
We will describe in detail the momentum space scheme.
It is worth noting that the configuration space scheme
was advocated in \cite{BV,BV2,BvdV}.

${}$For the purposes of illustration, we first consider two-loop
contributions to the effective action.
The relevant Feynman diagrams are either of  the `eight'
type  or `fish'  type, as shown in Figure 1.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig1}
\caption{Two-loop graphs: `eight' diagram and `fish' diagram.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The `eight' diagram
is relatively simple to treat since
it involves the product of two Green's functions
or their covariant derivatives in a
coincidence limit.
The situation for the `fish' diagram is somewhat more complex.
This diagram  makes a contribution to the effective action of the
form (with gauge indices suppressed)
\be
\int\limits_0^{\infty} {\rm d} s_1
\int\limits_0^{\infty} {\rm d} s_2
  \int\limits_0^{\infty} {\rm d} s_3
\int {\rm d}^d x \, \int {\rm d}^d x' \,  V_1(x) \, V_2(x') \,
K_1(x,x'|s_1) \,K_2(x,x'|s_2) \, K_3(x,x'|s_3)~,
\label{fish}
\ee
where the vertex factors $V_1(x)$ and $V_2(x')$  will in general
contribute insertions of the background fields, and may also contain
covariant derivatives which act on one or more of the kernels.
The procedure for evaluating (\ref{fish}), to be outlined below,
is to reduce this diagram to
%effectively splits it into two components -
a `skeleton'. The latter is characterized
by the following properties:
(i) all explicit background field dependence is collected
at a single vertex, say $x'$;
(ii) the  vertex at $x$ is connected to that
at $x'$ by four (undifferentiated) parallel
displacement propagators only;
(iii) the skeleton is gauge invariant at each vertex.
%of parallel displacement propagators,
%described diagrammatically by adding an extra line to
%the `fish' diagram,
%and a {\it gauge invariant} factor involving explicit dependence on
%background fields evaluated at only one of the vertices, say $x'$.

The kernels and their derivatives in (\ref{fish})
should be expressed as in (\ref{dKernel})  and (\ref{dKernel3}).
In particular, the background field dependence in the
kernels coming from either $\cP$ or from covariant derivatives
of $I(x,x')$  are
evaluated at $x'$, with $\cP (x) \,I(x,x')$ treated as in
(\ref{P}) .
The  $x$-dependence of each of the  kernels is then only via a
multiplicative factor $I(x,x')$,
Taylor factors $(x-x')^n$,
and via a phase factor ${\rm e}^{ {\rm i} k_i.(x-x')}$, where $k_i$
$(i = 1,2\, {\rm or} \, 3)$  denotes
the momentum associated with the  kernel.
In contrast, the vertices $V_1(x)$ and $V_2(x')$
contribute background fields
evaluated at  $x$ and $x'$ respectively. As stated earlier, the aim is to get
all explicit dependence on the background to be in the form of fields
evaluated at $x'.$ This can be achieved by the covariant Taylor
expansion of the product of fields in $V_1(x)$
in terms of fields evaluated at $x'$,
\be
\cV_1 (x) = I(x,x') \, \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
{1 \over n!} \, (x-x')^{a_1} \ldots (x-x')^{a_n} \,
\nabla' _{a_1} \ldots \nabla'_{a_n} \cV_1 (x') ~,
\ee
where $\cV_1(x)$ denotes the result of removing all covariant
derivatives from the vertex $V_1(x)$.
The covariant Taylor  expansion introduces
an additional factor of the
parallel displacement  propagator $I(x,x')$
(in the representation of the gauge
group under which  $\cV_1$ transforms).
This is denoted by the dashed
line $I_4(x,x')$ in Figure 2, while the
solid lines $I_i(x,x'), i = 1,2,3$ denote
the three parallel displacement propagators
arising from the kernels. The filled square denotes the
dependence on background fields, evaluated only at $x'.$
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig2}
\caption{Accumulation of explicit background field dependence at
one point.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The parallel displacement propagators $I_1(x,x'), \cdots, I_4(x,x')$
in Figure 2 are in general in different representations of the gauge
group. However, their  product
\be
I_4(x,x') \, I_1(x,x') \, I_2(x,x') \, I_3(x,x')
\ee
(gauge indices suppressed) is gauge invariant at  $x.$
Since each of these propagators satisfies the same
equation (\ref{PDO3}), it is straightforward to show
\be
I_4(x,x') \, I_1(x,x') \, I_2(x,x') \, I_3(x,x')
= 1~.
\ee
More precisely, the right-hand side of this relation is a product of
Kronecker deltas.
  Thus the `skeleton' of parallel displacement
propagators collapses, leaving all background field dependence in the
form of fields evaluated at $x',$ depicted by the square in Figure 2.
There are also explicit factors of $(x-x')$
from the covariant Taylor expansion of fields in
the vertex at $x$, and from covariant derivatives of the
parallel displacement propagators.
These can be traded for momentum derivatives by using
\be
(x-x')^a \, {\rm e}^{ {\rm i} k.(x-x')} F(k)  =  - \, {\rm i} \, F(k) \,
\frac{\partial}{\partial k_a} \, {\rm e}^{ {\rm i} k.(x-x')}
={\rm i}  \, {\rm e}^{ {\rm i} k.(x-x')} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial
k_a} F(k) +\ldots ~,
\label{kderiv}
\ee
where the dots denote
a total derivative,
which does not contribute to the momentum integral. This  leaves all the
dependence on $(x-x')$ in the form of the phase factor
$$
{\rm e}^{{\rm i} \, (k_1 + k_2 + k_3).(x-x')}~.
$$
  Since all background fields now depend
only on $x',$ the integral over $x$ is
\be
\int {\rm d}^dx \,{\rm e}^{ {\rm i} (k_1 + k_2 + k_3).(x - x')} =
  (2 \p)^d \, \delta^d(k_1 + k_2 + k_3)~,
  \ee
and this delta function allows  one of the three Gaussian momentum
integrals associated with the kernels to be eliminated.
The procedure outlined above results in an expression for the
contribution to the effective action from  the `fish'
diagram in the form\footnote{All covariant regularization
schemes are consistent with our approach, therefore this issue
does not require elaboration.}
\bea
& & \int {\rm d}^d x'

\times  F(s_1, s_2, s_3, k_1,
  k_2, \phi(x'))~,
  \eea
where $\phi$ denotes background fields and
their covariant derivatives.
The momentum integrals here are just Gaussian moments,
which are straightforward to compute.


At three and higher loops, a similar procedure can be implemented,
although the presence of extra vertices adds a complication. The aim
is to transform the $n$-vertex diagram to a `skeleton' which
has the following properties:
(i) all explicit background field dependence is collected
at a single vertex, say $x_n$;
(ii) the remaining vertices at $x_1, \ldots , x_{n-1}$ are connected to each
other and to the vertex at $x_n$ by (undifferentiated) parallel
displacement propagators only;
(iii) the skeleton is gauge invariant at each vertex.
Consider, for example, the three-loop graph  shown in
Figure 3.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig3}
\caption{A three-loop graph.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Suppose we wish to move all the background field dependence to
a single vertex, say  at $x_4.$
As a first step, we could choose to use the covariant Taylor expansion to
express the background fields in the vertex $V_1(x_1)$ in terms of fields
evaluated at $x_2,$ resulting in the introduction of a parallel
displacement propagator $I(x_1,x_2)$ in the representation of the
gauge group under which the fields in $V_1$ transform. Using the
steps outlined for the `fish' diagram, it is  also possible to
manipulate the kernel $K(x_1, x_2|s_1)$ (or its derivatives if
  derivatives from the vertices   act on it) and the
explicit factors of $(x_1 - x_2)$ in the Taylor series
  so that all of the $x_1$
dependence is in the form $e^{{\rm i} k_1.(x_1 - x_2)} \, I(x_1,
x_2).$ Here, the factor of $I(x_1, x_2)$ is in the representation under
which $K(x_1, x_2|s_1)$ transforms. A new vertex, $\tilde{V}_2(x_2),$
has effectively been generated at $x_2,$ consisting of the original
background dependence of the vertex multiplied by the additional
background dependence generated from $V_1(x_1)$ and $K(x_1, x_2|s_1).$
Diagrammatically, we have the situation in Figure 4, where the
circles denote original vertices and the square denotes the new
effective vertex.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig4}
\caption{Removing explicit field dependence at $x_1$.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Repeating this procedure, the explicit dependence on background
fields can be progessively moved through the diagram, at each step
removing the field dependence at one vertex at the cost of
introducing an additional parallel displacement propagator.
It should be stressed that this procedure preserves manifest gauge
invariance at each vertex.
When all explicit background field dependence has been moved to a
single point, the result is a skeleton as defined above.

Having produced the skeleton from
the original Feynman diagram, it is now necessary to evaluate it.
A very special case is that of a two-vertex skeleton,
as illustrated in Figure
5.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig5}
\caption{An arbitary two-vertex skeleton.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Here, the product of the parallel diplacement propagators
is gauge invariant at $x.$
Since  all the propagators  satisfy the same
equation (\ref{PDO3}), it is straightforward to show that the product
of parallel diplacement propagators simply collapses to
a product of Kronecker deltas,
leaving a gauge invariant contribution at a single point, $x'$.
In the case where the skeleton contains three or more vertices, it is
possible to systematically reduce it to a skeleton with only two
vertices; the resulting diagram then collapses to a single point as
above. We will
explain the procedure for reducing a skeleton with $n$ vertices to
one with $n-1$ vertices; this process is then iterated to produce the
two vertex skeleton.

The generic structure of the skeleton with $n$ vertices is shown in
Figure 6, where $x_1$ is the point where
all the explicit background field dependence is accumulated,
and the lines are parallel displacement
propagators.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig6}
\caption{An arbitrary $n$-vertex skeleton, $n \geq 3.$}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Focusing attention on a vertex adjacent to that at $x_1,$
say that at  $x_2,$ the diagram has  the structure
\be
{\rm Tr} \Big( I(x_1, x_2) \, \chi(x_2, x_1) \Big),
\ee
where $\chi(x_2,x_1)$ consists of the vertex at $x_1$ and products of parallel
displacement propagators (dependence on points other than $x_1$
and $x_2$ has been suppressed).
We can make use of the covariant
Taylor series to expand $I(x_1, x_2) \, \chi(x_2, x_1)$ in the form
\be
I(x_1, x_2) \, \chi(x_2, x_1) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \,
(x_2 - x_1)^{a_1} \cdots (x_2 - x_1)^{a_n} \,
\nabla _{a_1} \ldots \nabla_{a_n} \chi(y, x_1) \Big|_{y = x_1}~.
\ee
By this means, all $x_2$ dependence of the skeleton is now in the 
form of factors $(x_2 - x_1).$
These factors can be replaced by momentum derivatives of the phase factor
${\rm e}^{{\rm i} k. (x_1 - x_2)}$ associated with a Green's function
  in the original Feynman diagram, as in (\ref{kderiv}).
This process reduces number of vertices in the skeleton by one, as
illustrated in Figure 7.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}

\caption{Reducing an $n$-vertex skeleton to an $(n-1)$-vertex
skeleton, $n \geq 3.$}

\end{figure}
This completes our prescription for computing multi-loop
contributions to the effective action
in a manifestly covariant manner.
%multi-loop derivative expansion of the effective action.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the literature \cite{BV,BV2}, the configuration
space approach has been the favoured means to achieve a covariant
derivative expansion of the effective action.
A possible explanation for this is a belief that the transition
to momentum space should be incompatible with manifest
gauge invariance, see e.g. \cite{BvdV}.
As we have shown above, the latter is not the case.
Our momentum space scheme
is well-adapted to the derivative
expansion of the effective action,
in that it automatically links the
factors of momentum  to covariant derivatives of the
background fields. Further, this approach is more economical in that
there is no need to do
separate configuration and momentum space integrals
(configuration space integrals are just trivial).
In contrast, the configuration
space approach
requires separate computation (by carrying out momentum integrals)
of each Greeen's function
in a diagram to the required order in the derivative expansion, and
then the sewing together of
the Green's functions with configuration space
integrals.
As noted earlier, the configuration space approach
is well suited to the computation of the effective action
in special backgrounds,  as an exact
expression for the Green's function can sometimes be computed. An
example is a covariantly constant background;
we treat this case in $\cN =1$ super Yang-Mills in
sect. 6. It is worth noting that the momentum space scheme
can easily be formulated in curved space due to the existence
of a covariant Fourier integral \cite{Avr1}.


\sect{Parallel displacement  propagator in superspace}
\label{super-parallel-dis}

In four space-time dimensions, $d=4$, we consider a flat global
$\cN$-extended superspace parametrized by variables
$z^m = (x^m, \q^\m_i , {\bar \q}_{\dot{\m}}^i)$, where $i= 1,\ldots, \cN$.
We recall that
the flat covariant derivatives $D_A = (\pa_a, D_\a^i , {\bar D}^\ad_i)$
are related to the supersymmetric Cartan 1-forms
$\o^A =  (\o^a , \o^\a_i , {\bar \o}_\ad^i ) $ by
\be
{\rm d}z^M \,\pa_M = \o^A \, D_A~, \qquad
\o^A
= ({\rm d} x^a - {\rm i} \, {\rm d}\q_i  \s^a   {\bar \q}^i
+  {\rm i} \, \q_i  \s^a  {\rm d} {\bar \q}^i ,

\ee
and satisfy  the algebra

(i) left to the end of calculation; or
(ii) carried out first.
These choices give rise to two different {\it manifestly} covariant
perturbation schemes: (i) momentum space scheme;
(ii) configuration space scheme. In our opinion,
the former is most suitable for arbitrary backgrounds,
while the latter is better adapted to special background
configurations such as a covariantly constant field.
We will describe in detail the momentum space scheme.
It is worth noting that the configuration space scheme
was advocated in \cite{BV,BV2,BvdV}.

${}$For the purposes of illustration, we first consider two-loop
contributions to the effective action.
The relevant Feynman diagrams are either of  the `eight'
type  or `fish'  type, as shown in Figure 1.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig1}
\caption{Two-loop graphs: `eight' diagram and `fish' diagram.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The `eight' diagram
is relatively simple to treat since
it involves the product of two Green's functions
or their covariant derivatives in a
coincidence limit.
The situation for the `fish' diagram is somewhat more complex.
This diagram  makes a contribution to the effective action of the
form (with gauge indices suppressed)
\be
\int\limits_0^{\infty} {\rm d} s_1
\int\limits_0^{\infty} {\rm d} s_2
  \int\limits_0^{\infty} {\rm d} s_3

K_1(x,x'|s_1) \,K_2(x,x'|s_2) \, K_3(x,x'|s_3)~,
\label{fish}
\ee
where the vertex factors $V_1(x)$ and $V_2(x')$  will in general
contribute insertions of the background fields, and may also contain
covariant derivatives which act on one or more of the kernels.
The procedure for evaluating (\ref{fish}), to be outlined below,
is to reduce this diagram to
%effectively splits it into two components -
a `skeleton'. The latter is characterized
by the following properties:
(i) all explicit background field dependence is collected
at a single vertex, say $x'$;
(ii) the  vertex at $x$ is connected to that
at $x'$ by four (undifferentiated) parallel
displacement propagators only;
(iii) the skeleton is gauge invariant at each vertex.
%of parallel displacement propagators,
%described diagrammatically by adding an extra line to
%the `fish' diagram,
%and a {\it gauge invariant} factor involving explicit dependence on
%background fields evaluated at only one of the vertices, say $x'$.

The kernels and their derivatives in (\ref{fish})
should be expressed as in (\ref{dKernel})  and (\ref{dKernel3}).
In particular, the background field dependence in the
kernels coming from either $\cP$ or from covariant derivatives
of $I(x,x')$  are
evaluated at $x'$, with $\cP (x) \,I(x,x')$ treated as in
(\ref{P}) .
The  $x$-dependence of each of the  kernels is then only via a
multiplicative factor $I(x,x')$,
Taylor factors $(x-x')^n$,
and via a phase factor ${\rm e}^{ {\rm i} k_i.(x-x')}$, where $k_i$
$(i = 1,2\, {\rm or} \, 3)$  denotes
the momentum associated with the  kernel.
In contrast, the vertices $V_1(x)$ and $V_2(x')$
contribute background fields
evaluated at  $x$ and $x'$ respectively. As stated earlier, the aim is to get
all explicit dependence on the background to be in the form of fields
evaluated at $x'.$ This can be achieved by the covariant Taylor
expansion of the product of fields in $V_1(x)$
in terms of fields evaluated at $x'$,
\be
\cV_1 (x) = I(x,x') \, \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
{1 \over n!} \, (x-x')^{a_1} \ldots (x-x')^{a_n} \,
\nabla' _{a_1} \ldots \nabla'_{a_n} \cV_1 (x') ~,
\ee
where $\cV_1(x)$ denotes the result of removing all covariant
derivatives from the vertex $V_1(x)$.
The covariant Taylor  expansion introduces
an additional factor of the
parallel displacement  propagator $I(x,x')$
(in the representation of the gauge
group under which  $\cV_1$ transforms).
This is denoted by the dashed
line $I_4(x,x')$ in Figure 2, while the
solid lines $I_i(x,x'), i = 1,2,3$ denote
the three parallel displacement propagators
arising from the kernels. The filled square denotes the
dependence on background fields, evaluated only at $x'.$
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig2}
\caption{Accumulation of explicit background field dependence at
one point.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The parallel displacement propagators $I_1(x,x'), \cdots, I_4(x,x')$
in Figure 2 are in general in different representations of the gauge
group. However, their  product
\be
I_4(x,x') \, I_1(x,x') \, I_2(x,x') \, I_3(x,x')
\ee
(gauge indices suppressed) is gauge invariant at  $x.$
Since each of these propagators satisfies the same
equation (\ref{PDO3}), it is straightforward to show
\be
I_4(x,x') \, I_1(x,x') \, I_2(x,x') \, I_3(x,x')
= 1~.
\ee
More precisely, the right-hand side of this relation is a product of
Kronecker deltas.
  Thus the `skeleton' of parallel displacement
propagators collapses, leaving all background field dependence in the
form of fields evaluated at $x',$ depicted by the square in Figure 2.
There are also explicit factors of $(x-x')$
from the covariant Taylor expansion of fields in
the vertex at $x$, and from covariant derivatives of the
parallel displacement propagators.
These can be traded for momentum derivatives by using
\be
(x-x')^a \, {\rm e}^{ {\rm i} k.(x-x')} F(k)  =  - \, {\rm i} \, F(k) \,
\frac{\partial}{\partial k_a} \, {\rm e}^{ {\rm i} k.(x-x')}
={\rm i}  \, {\rm e}^{ {\rm i} k.(x-x')} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial
k_a} F(k) +\ldots ~,
\label{kderiv}
\ee
where the dots denote
a total derivative,
which does not contribute to the momentum integral. This  leaves all the
dependence on $(x-x')$ in the form of the phase factor
$$
{\rm e}^{{\rm i} \, (k_1 + k_2 + k_3).(x-x')}~.
$$
  Since all background fields now depend
only on $x',$ the integral over $x$ is
\be
\int {\rm d}^dx \,{\rm e}^{ {\rm i} (k_1 + k_2 + k_3).(x - x')} =
  (2 \p)^d \, \delta^d(k_1 + k_2 + k_3)~,
  \ee
and this delta function allows  one of the three Gaussian momentum
integrals associated with the kernels to be eliminated.
The procedure outlined above results in an expression for the
contribution to the effective action from  the `fish'
diagram in the form\footnote{All covariant regularization
schemes are consistent with our approach, therefore this issue
does not require elaboration.}
\bea

where $\phi$ denotes background fields and
their covariant derivatives.
The momentum integrals here are just Gaussian moments,
which are straightforward to compute.


At three and higher loops, a similar procedure can be implemented,
although the presence of extra vertices adds a complication. The aim
is to transform the $n$-vertex diagram to a `skeleton' which
has the following properties:
(i) all explicit background field dependence is collected
at a single vertex, say $x_n$;
(ii) the remaining vertices at $x_1, \ldots , x_{n-1}$ are connected to each
other and to the vertex at $x_n$ by (undifferentiated) parallel
displacement propagators only;
(iii) the skeleton is gauge invariant at each vertex.
Consider, for example, the three-loop graph  shown in
Figure 3.

\noindent
Suppose we wish to move all the background field dependence to
a single vertex, say  at $x_4.$
As a first step, we could choose to use the covariant Taylor expansion to
express the background fields in the vertex $V_1(x_1)$ in terms of fields
evaluated at $x_2,$ resulting in the introduction of a parallel
displacement propagator $I(x_1,x_2)$ in the representation of the
gauge group under which the fields in $V_1$ transform. Using the
steps outlined for the `fish' diagram, it is  also possible to
manipulate the kernel $K(x_1, x_2|s_1)$ (or its derivatives if
  derivatives from the vertices   act on it) and the
explicit factors of $(x_1 - x_2)$ in the Taylor series
  so that all of the $x_1$
dependence is in the form $e^{{\rm i} k_1.(x_1 - x_2)} \, I(x_1,
x_2).$ Here, the factor of $I(x_1, x_2)$ is in the representation under
which $K(x_1, x_2|s_1)$ transforms. A new vertex, $\tilde{V}_2(x_2),$
has effectively been generated at $x_2,$ consisting of the original
background dependence of the vertex multiplied by the additional
background dependence generated from $V_1(x_1)$ and $K(x_1, x_2|s_1).$
Diagrammatically, we have the situation in Figure 4, where the
circles denote original vertices and the square denotes the new
effective vertex.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Repeating this procedure, the explicit dependence on background
fields can be progessively moved through the diagram, at each step
removing the field dependence at one vertex at the cost of
introducing an additional parallel displacement propagator.
It should be stressed that this procedure preserves manifest gauge
invariance at each vertex.
When all explicit background field dependence has been moved to a
single point, the result is a skeleton as defined above.

Having produced the skeleton from
the original Feynman diagram, it is now necessary to evaluate it.
A very special case is that of a two-vertex skeleton,
as illustrated in Figure
5.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig5}
\caption{An arbitary two-vertex skeleton.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Here, the product of the parallel diplacement propagators
is gauge invariant at $x.$
Since  all the propagators  satisfy the same
equation (\ref{PDO3}), it is straightforward to show that the product
of parallel diplacement propagators simply collapses to
a product of Kronecker deltas,
leaving a gauge invariant contribution at a single point, $x'$.
In the case where the skeleton contains three or more vertices, it is
possible to systematically reduce it to a skeleton with only two
vertices; the resulting diagram then collapses to a single point as
above. We will
explain the procedure for reducing a skeleton with $n$ vertices to
one with $n-1$ vertices; this process is then iterated to produce the
two vertex skeleton.

The generic structure of the skeleton with $n$ vertices is shown in
Figure 6, where $x_1$ is the point where
all the explicit background field dependence is accumulated,
and the lines are parallel displacement
propagators.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{fig6}
\caption{An arbitrary $n$-vertex skeleton, $n \geq 3.$}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Focusing attention on a vertex adjacent to that at $x_1,$
say that at  $x_2,$ the diagram has  the structure
\be
{\rm Tr} \Big( I(x_1, x_2) \, \chi(x_2, x_1) \Big),
\ee
where $\chi(x_2,x_1)$ consists of the vertex at $x_1$ and products of parallel
displacement propagators (dependence on points other than $x_1$
and $x_2$ has been suppressed).
We can make use of the covariant
Taylor series to expand $I(x_1, x_2) \, \chi(x_2, x_1)$ in the form
\be
I(x_1, x_2) \, \chi(x_2, x_1) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \,
(x_2 - x_1)^{a_1} \cdots (x_2 - x_1)^{a_n} \,
\nabla _{a_1} \ldots \nabla_{a_n} \chi(y, x_1) \Big|_{y = x_1}~.
\ee
By this means, all $x_2$ dependence of the skeleton is now in the 
form of factors $(x_2 - x_1).$
These factors can be replaced by momentum derivatives of the phase factor
${\rm e}^{{\rm i} k. (x_1 - x_2)}$ associated with a Green's function
  in the original Feynman diagram, as in (\ref{kderiv}).
This process reduces number of vertices in the skeleton by one, as
illustrated in Figure 7.

skeleton, $n \geq 3.$}

This completes our prescription for computing multi-loop
contributions to the effective action
in a manifestly covariant manner.
%multi-loop derivative expansion of the effective action.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the literature \cite{BV,BV2}, the configuration
space approach has been the favoured means to achieve a covariant
derivative expansion of the effective action.
A possible explanation for this is a belief that the transition
to momentum space should be incompatible with manifest
gauge invariance, see e.g. \cite{BvdV}.
As we have shown above, the latter is not the case.
Our momentum space scheme
is well-adapted to the derivative
expansion of the effective action,
in that it automatically links the
factors of momentum  to covariant derivatives of the
background fields. Further, this approach is more economical in that
there is no need to do
separate configuration and momentum space integrals
(configuration space integrals are just trivial).
In contrast, the configuration
space approach
requires separate computation (by carrying out momentum integrals)
of each Greeen's function
in a diagram to the required order in the derivative expansion, and
then the sewing together of
the Green's functions with configuration space
integrals.
As noted earlier, the configuration space approach
is well suited to the computation of the effective action
in special backgrounds,  as an exact
expression for the Green's function can sometimes be computed. An
example is a covariantly constant background;
we treat this case in $\cN =1$ super Yang-Mills in
sect. 6. It is worth noting that the momentum space scheme
can easily be formulated in curved space due to the existence
of a covariant Fourier integral \cite{Avr1}.


\sect{Parallel displacement  propagator in superspace}
\label{super-parallel-dis}

In four space-time dimensions, $d=4$, we consider a flat global
$\cN$-extended superspace parametrized by variables
$z^m = (x^m, \q^\m_i , {\bar \q}_{\dot{\m}}^i)$, where $i= 1,\ldots, \cN$.
We recall that
the flat covariant derivatives $D_A = (\pa_a, D_\a^i , {\bar D}^\ad_i)$
are related to the supersymmetric Cartan 1-forms
$\o^A =  (\o^a , \o^\a_i , {\bar \o}_\ad^i ) $ by
\be
{\rm d}z^M \,\pa_M = \o^A \, D_A~, \qquad
\o^A
= ({\rm d} x^a - {\rm i} \, {\rm d}\q_i  \s^a   {\bar \q}^i
+  {\rm i} \, \q_i  \s^a  {\rm d} {\bar \q}^i ,
{\rm d} \q^\a_i , {\rm d} {\bar \q}_\ad^i )~,
