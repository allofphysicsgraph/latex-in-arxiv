In many aspects the most complicated foliated manifolds are those with 
nonvanishing Godbillon-Vey class. We argue that they probably do not appear in 
physics and that is due to gauge symmetry which prevents the foliation from 
becoming ``too wild''; that means that the foliation does not develop resilient
 leaves which, at least in codim-1, by Duminy's theorem are responsible for 
the appearence of nontrivial GV-class.


PACS classification: 11.10.-z; 11.15.-q; 11.30.-Ly\\

Keywords: Godbillon-Vey class, foliations, noncommutative geometry, 
supergravity, M-Theory\\
