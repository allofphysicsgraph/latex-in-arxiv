The Casimir forces on two parallel plates in conformally flat de
Sitter background due to conformally coupled massless scalar field
satisfying mixed boundary conditions on the plates is
investigated. In the general case of mixed boundary conditions
formulae are derived for the vacuum expectation values of the
energy-momentum tensor and vacuum forces acting on boundaries.
 Different cosmological constants are
assumed for the space between and outside of the plates to have
general results applicable to the case of domain wall formations
in the early universe.
