\item  The geometry will have closed timelike curves. It is important to
stress that we are talking about the \textit{uncompactified} geometry, and
not of the one obtained after identifying by $e^{\kappa }$.

\item  If we excise from the spacetime manifold the region where $\kappa $
is timelike, then the resulting geometry is free from closed timelike
curves. As discussed in \cite{CCK}, the excision is necessary to correctly
embed these geometries in $M$--theory. This procedure introduces a boundary
in the geometry which corresponds, in string/$M$--theory, to the presence of
orientifold planes. We will recall these points more at length in the next
section.
