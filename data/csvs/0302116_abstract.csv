We show that in applications of variational
theory to quantum field theory
it is essential to account for the
correct Wegner
exponent $ \omega $ governing  the  approach to the
strong-coupling,
or scaling limit.
Otherwise
the
procedure either does not converge
at all or
 to the
wrong limit.
This invalidates
all papers
applying the
so-called $ \delta $-expansion
to quantum field theory.
