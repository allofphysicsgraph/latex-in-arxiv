$I^-_C$ is outer continuous with respect to $\bar {\cal T}$ for the
causal completion $\bar M$ of a homogeneous plane wave satisfying the
positive energy condition.

2,"\begin{thm}
\label{char}
For homogeneous plane wave spacetimes satisfying a positive energy
condition, a sequence
$\{ x_n \} \subset \bar M$ converges to $\bar P$ in $\bar {\cal T}$
if and only if $\lim I^+_C(x_n) = I^+_C(\bar P)$ and $\lim I^-_C(x_n) = I^-_C(\bar P)$.
