{pullingremnants1.eps} \caption{Two different time evolution
processes characterized by S-branes.  The three pictures on the
left characterize the rolling tachyon picture so the S-brane
appears only when the tachyon crosses the top of the potential.
The second three pictures give a schematic of remnant creation. We
start off with some energy in the tachyon and perhaps in other
fields.  As the tachyon rolls, at some point it starts to create
$T=0$ regions specified by the thick lines which eventually turn
into remnants. At late times, the tachyon does not roll (no
velocity arrow) as all the energy has been transferred into the
remnant kink.} \label{pullingremnant}
