\begin{quote}

The standard quantum states of $n$ complex Grassmann variables with a
free-particle Lagrangian transform as a spinor of $SO(2n)$. However, the
same `free-fermion' model has a non-linearly realized $SU(n|1)$ symmetry;
it can be viewed as the mechanics of a `particle' on the Grassmann-odd
coset space $SU(n|1)/U(n)$. We implement a quantization of this model for
which the states with non-zero norm transform as a representation of
$SU(n|1)$, the representation depending on the $U(1)$ charge of
the wave-function. For $n=2$ the wave-function can be interpreted
as a BRST superfield.

\section{Introduction}

Pseudo-classical mechanics models, with anticommuting variables, have
found various applications. One class of applications is to the
pseudo-classical description of spin. Consider the `free-fermion'
Lagrangian
\begin{equation}\label{lag1}
L = i\gamma\,\bar\zeta\cdot \dot \zeta
\end{equation}
for $n$ complex anticommuting variables $\zeta^i$ and their complex
conjugates $\bar\zeta_i$ ($\gamma$ is a real, positive, dimensionless
coupling constant).
This Lagrangian has an obvious $U(n)$ invariance
but it is also invariant under the larger group $SO(2n)$. In a (coherent
state) basis for which the quantum operators corresponding to the
variables $\bar\zeta_i$ are diagonal, with eigenvalues $\bar\zeta_i$, the
Hilbert space of the quantum theory is spanned by anti-holomorphic
functions $\Phi(\{\bar\zeta\})$. This space has dimension $2^n$ and
carries a spinor representation of $SO(2n)$.

The above Lagrangian is also invariant, although less obviously, under the
following non-linear, and non-analytic, transformations
\begin{equation}\label{susy1}
\delta_\epsilon \zeta^i = \left[1+ \zeta \cdot\bar\zeta\right]^{1\over2} \
\epsilon^i +  {\left(\bar\epsilon \cdot \zeta +
\epsilon\cdot\bar\zeta\right)\over 2 \left[1+ \zeta
\cdot\bar\zeta\right]^{1\over2}}\
\zeta^i
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon^i$ are constant anticommuting parameters.
These transformations close on those of $U(n)$ to form the
superalgebra $SU(n|1)$. In other words, the above free-fermion Lagrangian
provides a non-linear realization of the supergroup $SU(n|1)$, with
$\zeta^i$ parametrizing the Grassmann-odd coset $SU(n|1)/U(n)$.

The full symmetry group is actually much larger than either $SO(2n)$ or
$SU(n|1)$; it is the supergroup of supersymplectic diffeomorphisms of a
superspace of real dimension $(0|2n)$, which is generated by all $2^{2n}$
functions on the Grassmann-odd phase-space. An alternative
characterization of it is as the closure of its two subgroups $SO(2n)$
and $SU(n|1)$. Both subgroups contain $U(n)$, which acts in an
obvious way on quantum wave-functions, so the Hilbert space decomposes
into representations of $U(n)$. In the standard quantum theory these
representations combine to yield the spinor of $SO(2n)$ and the Hilbert
space norm is the standard scalar product of two spinors.

However, one could attempt to combine the $U(n)$ representations into
representations of $SU(n|1)$ rather than $SO(2n)$. In this case, the
`Hilbert' space would be a vector superspace of
dimension $(2^{n-1}|2^{n-1})$ rather than a vector space of dimension
$2^n$, so this quantization of the free-fermion model would be very
different from the standard one; a motivation for
considering this possibility is that the $n=2$ `Hilbert' space would
then carry a representation of the Euclidean BRST group $SU(2|1)\cong
OSp(2|2)$ (see e.g. \cite{siegel}).

We shall show here that this
non-standard quantization can be implemented, but the result depends on
the resolution of an operator ordering ambiguity which leads to an
ambiguity in the definition of the $U(1)$ charge or, equivalently, the
assignment of $U(1)$ charge to the wave-function. There is a `natural'
choice, for which the $U(1)$ charge is the direct quantum analog of the
$U(1)$ Noether charge of the Lagrangian (\ref{lag1}) but, for
completeness, we consider other choices too. In many cases the
`Hilbert' space has zero norm states so the physical states in `Hilbert'
space should be taken to be the equivalence classes of states with
non-zero norm  modulo the addition of zero norm states. The $SU(n|1)$
representation content of the physical `Hilbert' space depends on the
$U(1)$ charge assigned to the wave-function. For the `natural'
resolution of the operator ordering, and $\gamma = n-1$,
we find that the physical Hilbert space is an $SU(n|1)$ singlet!

Presumably, these results could be derived by a direct attempt to
implement the $SU(n|1)$ symmetry on the `Hilbert' space found by
canonical quantization of (\ref{lag1}) but the non-analyticity of the
non-linear transformations (\ref{susy1}) makes it difficult to see how
to
do this. We
can overcome this problem by introducing the new variables
\begin{equation}
\xi^i = {\zeta^i\over \left[1+ \zeta \cdot\bar\zeta\right]^{1\over2}}\,,
\end{equation}
in terms of which the $SU(n|1)$ supersymmetry transformations are
analytic:
\begin{equation}
\label{antransf}
\delta_\epsilon \xi^i = \epsilon^i + \bar \epsilon\cdot \xi\, \xi^i\,.
\end{equation}
The Lagrangian in these new variables is\footnote{There is some similarity
to the QM reduction of the Volkov-Akulov model \cite{VA} which realizes
Poincar\'e supersymmetry non-linearly in terms of a Goldstino
variable.}
\begin{equation}
\label{nonlinlag}
L =  i\,\gamma \left[1 + \bar\xi\cdot \xi\right]^{-1} \bar\xi\cdot \dot
\xi\,.
\end{equation}
This Lagrangian can be shown to be the 1-dimensional pullback of
the $U(1)$ connection one-form in the nonlinear realization of $SU(n|1)$ in
the Grassmann-odd coset space $SU(n|1)/U(n)$. It is shifted by a total
derivative
under the $SU(n|1)$ transformations and so is a sort of 1-dimensional
Wess-Zumino (WZ) term. It contains `interactions' which complicate
the canonical quantization
procedure, but this problem is easily solved in a way that will
now be described.

\section{Analytic quantization}

An equivalent phase-space form of the  Lagrangian (\ref{nonlinlag}) is
\begin{equation}\label{lagphase}
L =  \left\{i\pi\cdot \dot\xi - \lambda^i\varphi_i\right\} + \mbox{c.c.}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda^i$ are Lagrange multipliers for $n$ complex phase space
constraints, with constraint functions
\begin{equation}\label{defvarphi}
\varphi_i = \pi_i - {\gamma \over2}\left[1 + \bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{-1}
\bar\xi_i\,.
\end{equation}
Solving these constraints returns us to the original Lagrangian, up to a
total derivative. The $SU(n|1)$-supersymmetry transformations of the new
Lagrangian are
\begin{eqnarray}\label{susyphase}
\delta \xi^i &=& \epsilon^i + \bar \epsilon\cdot \xi \xi^i\,, \nonumber \\
\delta \pi_i &=& {\gamma\over2}\bar\epsilon_i + \bar\epsilon_i\xi\cdot \pi -
\bar\epsilon\cdot\xi \pi_i\,, \nonumber \\
\delta \lambda^i &=& \bar\epsilon\cdot\xi\lambda^i +
\bar\epsilon\cdot\lambda\xi^i\,.
\end{eqnarray}

The $n$ complex constraint functions $\{\varphi\}$ are
equivalent to $2n$ real constraint functions that are second class, in
Dirac's terminology. However, the $n$ complex constraint functions are in
involution; it is only when we consider their complex conjugates that the
system of constraints becomes second class. In \cite{MR,HM} it was shown
that
when $2n$ real second class constraints can be separated into two sets of
$n$ real constraints in involution then one may quantize without
constraints on canonical space variables by imposing one set of $n$
constraints on the Hilbert space states and discarding the other
set\footnote{To our knowledge, for
systems with Grassmann second-class constraints the possibility of such a
quantization scheme was mentioned for the first time in \cite{CA}. The
idea behind it is that one set of constraints can be
interpreted as the $n$ gauge-fixing conditions for $n$ gauge-invariances
generated by the other set.}. Here we shall adopt an `analytic'
version of this procedure which, for Grassman variables, actually
preceded the formulation of the method for the real case; in this
context it has been called `Gupta-Bleuler quantization' \cite{LL,AL}.

As the method involves working with an unconstrained phase
space, the anticommutation relations follow directly from the canonical
Poisson brackets, and these may be realized by setting\footnote{The
classical anticommuting variable $\bar\pi$ is the complex
conjugate of the variable $\pi$, whereas the complex conjugate of
$\partial/\partial\xi$ is, for standard complex conjugation conventions,
$-\partial/\partial\bar \xi$. The conjugation in the quantum case
should be understood with respect to the properly defined
$SU(n|1)$ invariant scalar product, as discussed in section 4.}
\begin{equation}
\pi_i = {\partial\over\partial\xi^i}\, ,\qquad
\bar\pi^i = {\partial\over\partial\bar \xi_i}\,.\label{conjugacy}
\end{equation}
To take the constraints into account we require that physical states be
annihilated by the $n$ operators $\varphi_i$; this is equivalent to the
`analyticity' conditions\footnote{This is analogous to the chirality
condition on 4D chiral superfields, which arises in a similar way from
analytic quantization of the 4D superparticle \cite{Frydr,Dima}. See
\cite{bandos} for other analogous aspects of the superparticle case.}
\begin{equation}
{\partial\Psi \over \partial \xi^i} = {\gamma\over2}\left[1 +
\bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{-1}\bar\xi_i\Psi\, ,
\qquad i=1,\dots,n\,,
\label{cond}
\end{equation}
on wave-functions $\Psi(\{\xi\},\{\bar\xi\})$. These conditions have the
solution
\begin{equation}
\label{solution2}
\Psi = \left[1+\bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{-{\gamma\over 2}} \Phi
\end{equation}
for anti-analytic $\Phi$, which has the expansion
\begin{equation}
\Phi = c_{(0)} + \bar\xi_i c_{(1)}^i  + \dots +
\bar\xi_{i_1}\dots
\bar\xi_{i_{n-1}}\ c_{(n-1)}^{i_1\dots i_{n-1}} + \bar\xi_{i_1}\dots
\bar\xi_{i_n}\ c_{(n)}^{i_1 \dots i_n}\,,\label{expansion}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
c_{(n-1)}^{i_1\dots i_{n-1}} \equiv {1\over (n-1)!}\varepsilon^{i_1\dots
i_{n-1}i_n}c_{(n-1)\,i_n}\,, \quad
c_{(n)}^{i_1 \dots i_n} \equiv {1\over n!}\varepsilon^{i_1\dots
i_n}c_{(n)}\ , \ldots~.
\end{equation}

In principle each of the $2^n$ coefficients could have any Grassmann parity
but to implement $SO(2n)$ invariance we would have to choose all of them to
have the same Grassmann parity, which must be even for a positive definite
norm. In this way we would recover the standard free-fermion Hilbert space,
as a $2^n$-dimensional vector space, although the $SO(2n)$ invariance is not
manifest in our approach and has to be imposed. Here however, we wish to
explore the alternative possibility that the `Hilbert' space carries some
representation of the supergroup $SU(n|1)\,$. For this to be possible we
must take the anti-analytic function $\Phi$ to have a {\sl definite}
Grassmann parity\footnote{The same requirement is made in the standard
quantization of the superparticle, in contrast to the `spinning
particle'. In fact, as the 4-dimensional spinning particle and
superparticle Lagrangians can be shown to be {\sl classically}
equivalent \cite{VZ,STVZ,pkt}, the difference between the
two can be ascribed to
different quantization procedures, in close analogy to the
`free fermion' model considered here.}.
In this case the `Hilbert' space is a vector superspace of
dimension $(2^{n-1}|2^{n-1})\,$; for a reason to be made clear later, we
assume that $\Phi$ is Grassmann-even for $n$ even and Grassmann-odd for $n$
odd. Our next task is to determine how $SU(n|1)$ acts in this `Hilbert'
space.

\section{$SU(n|1)$ in `Hilbert' space}

The linear $U(n)$ transformations of the canonical variables of the
Lagrangian (\ref{lagphase}) are generated by the Noether charges
\begin{equation}
\label{noether}
J^i{}_j = \bar\xi_j\bar\pi^i - \xi^i\pi_j\, .
\end{equation}
The corresponding quantum $U(n)$ generators are the differential operators
\begin{equation}
\hat J^i{}_j = \bar\xi_j{\partial\over\partial\bar\xi_i} -
\xi^i{\partial\over \partial\xi^j}\,.
\end{equation}
For wave-functions of the form (\ref{solution2}) we have
\begin{equation}
\hat J^i{}_j \Psi = \left[1 + \bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{-{\gamma\over2}}
\bar\xi_j{\partial\Phi\over\partial\bar\xi_i}\,,
\end{equation}
from which we deduce the $U(n)$ transformation of $\Phi$ to be
\begin{equation}
\delta_\omega\Phi
=\omega_i{}^j\, \bar\xi_j{\partial\Phi\over\partial\bar\xi_i}
\end{equation}
where $\bar\omega^i{}_j = - \omega_j{}^i\,$.

The nonlinear supersymmetry transformations of (\ref{susyphase}) are
generated by the Grassmann-odd Noether charges
\begin{equation}
S_i = \pi_i + {\gamma\over2}\bar\xi_i - \bar\xi_i\sum_j \bar\xi_j \bar\pi^j
\,
,\qquad  \bar S^i = \bar\pi^i + {\gamma\over2}\xi^i + \xi^i \sum_j
\xi^j\pi_j\,.\label{classS}
\end{equation}
Note the presence of the terms linear in $\xi$ and $\bar \xi$; these
arise from the fact that the supersymmetry variation of the Lagrangian
is not zero but rather a total time derivative. These terms have no
effect on the transformations of $\xi^i$ generated by $\hat S$ and
$\hat {\bar S}$, which are those of (\ref{antransf}), but they {\it do}
contribute to the $U(1)$ charge in the $SU(n|1)$ superalgebra of Poisson
brackets of Noether charges. In fact, one finds that the $U(1)$ charge is
\begin{equation}\label{bee}
B = \left({1\over n}-1\right) J^i{}_i + \gamma
\end{equation}
where the shift by $\gamma$ is directly attributable to the
$\gamma$-dependent linear terms in $\hat S$ and $\hat {\bar S}$. In
passing to the quantum theory, the coefficients of these terms become
ambiguous because of operator ordering ambiguities. This ambiguity is
partially fixed by requiring that physical wave-functions $\Psi$ of the
form (\ref{solution2}) transform into physical wave-functions, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\delta_\epsilon{\Psi}  \equiv -\left(\bar\epsilon\cdot \hat{\bar S} +
\epsilon\cdot S\right)\Psi =
\left[1+\bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{-{\gamma\over 2}}\delta_\epsilon{\Phi} .
\end{equation}
This leaves us with the following quantum supersymmetry generators,
parametrized by a real number $\alpha$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat S_i &=& {\partial\over\partial\xi^i} + {{\alpha}\over2}\bar\xi_i -
\bar\xi_i
\left(\bar\xi \cdot {\partial \over \partial\bar \xi}\right), \nonumber \\
\hat {\bar S}{}^i &=& {\partial\over\partial\bar\xi_i} +
{{\gamma}\over2}\xi^i +
\xi^i{\left(\xi\cdot {\partial \over \partial \xi}\right)}. \label{quantS}
\end{eqnarray}
These have the anticommutation relation
\begin{equation}
\{\hat{S}_i, \hat{\bar S}^j \} = \left[\hat{J}^j{}_i -
{1\over n} \delta_i^j \hat J^k{}_k\right] + \delta_i^j \hat B
\end{equation}
where $\hat B$ is the quantum $U(1)$ generator
\begin{equation}
\hat B =  \left({1\over n}-1\right)\hat J^k{}_k + {1\over2}\left(\gamma +
\alpha\right).
\end{equation}
One sees from this that the choice
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \gamma
\end{equation}
is `natural' because it leads to a quantum $U(1)\subset SU(n|1)$
generator that is the direct quantum counterpart of the classical
$U(1)$ charge $B$ of (\ref{bee}). Nevertheless, we shall consider the
case of general $\alpha$ in what follows.

We now compute the action of the charges $\hat S_i, {\hat{\bar S}}^i$, on
physical wave-functions. One finds that
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat {\bar S}^i \Psi &=& \left[1+
\bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{-{\gamma\over2}}
\left[{\;\;\partial\Phi\over \partial
\bar\xi_i}\right] \nonumber \\
\hat S_i\Psi &=&  \left[1+
\bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{-{\gamma\over2}}
\left[{1\over2}{\left( \gamma + \alpha \right)\bar\xi_i }
-\bar\xi_i\left(\bar\xi \cdot
{\partial\over\partial\bar\xi}\right)\right]\Phi.
\end{eqnarray}
These results yield the following $SU(n|1)$-supersymmetry transformation
of $\Phi$:
\begin{equation}\label{trans}
\delta_\epsilon\Phi =
-\left[q(\epsilon\cdot\bar\xi) + \bar\epsilon\cdot
{\partial\over\partial\bar\xi}
- \left(\epsilon\cdot
\bar\xi\right) \bar\xi\cdot
{\partial\over\partial\bar\xi}\right]\Phi
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
q={1\over 2}(\gamma+\alpha)\,.
\end{equation}
For component fields in the expansion (\ref{expansion}) this
transformation implies
\begin{eqnarray}\label{transcomp}
&& \delta_{\epsilon} c_{(k)}^{i_1\ldots i_k} = (-1)^k\left\{ [k-1 -q]
\epsilon^{[i_1} c_{(k-1)}^{i_2 \ldots i_k]} -(1 -
\delta_{k,n})(k+1)\,\bar\epsilon_j c^{ji_1\ldots i_k}_{(k+1)}\right\}\;
(k \geq 2)\,,\nonumber \\
&& \delta_{\epsilon}c_{(0)} = - \bar\epsilon_i c_{(1)}^i\,, \quad
\delta_{\epsilon}c_{(1)}^i = q\epsilon^i c_{(0)} + 2\bar\epsilon_j
c^{ji}_{(2)}\;.
\end{eqnarray}
The full set of $SU(n|1)$ transformations of $\Phi$ are such that
\begin{equation}\label{transphi}
\Phi'(\{\bar\xi'\}) =e^{iqs(\{\bar\xi\})} \Phi(\{\bar\xi\})
\label{gltran}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is a local function of $\bar\xi$. Thus, $\Phi$ is a scalar
anti-analytic superfield when q=0; for other values of $q$, including
the `natural' value $q=\gamma$, one may consider $\Phi$ as a charged
scalar superfield, with charge $q$.

We have supposed up to now that $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are arbitrary real
variables but one might expect the combination $q$ to be
quantized\footnote{For example, we have $q=\gamma$ for the `natural'
choice $\alpha=\gamma$ but, as mentioned earlier, $\gamma$ is the
coefficient of a WZ term. By analogy with the bosonic WZ terms, this
coefficient is expected to be quantized, though the origin of this
phenomenon can differ according to the case considered.}. As we
shall see, the representation
content of
the physical `Hilbert' space depends on $q$ and simplifications,
associated with the existence of zero norm states, occur for special
integer values of $q$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{$SU(n|1)$-invariant norm}

In order to construct an invariant inner product one must first obtain an
$SU(n|1)$ invariant measure under the coordinate transformations
(\ref{antransf}). With the help of the lemma
\begin{equation}
\delta_\epsilon \left[1+ \bar\xi\cdot\xi\right] =
\left(\bar\epsilon\cdot\xi -\epsilon\cdot\bar\xi\right)\left[1+
\bar\xi\cdot\xi\right],
\end{equation}
it is not difficult to show that the $SU(n|1)$ invariant measure is such
that
\begin{equation}
\int \!d\mu = \int \!d\mu_0 \left[1 + \bar\xi\cdot \xi\right]^{n-1}~,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\int d\mu_0 = \prod_i {\partial\over\partial\bar\xi_i}
{\partial\over\partial\xi^i}\,.
\end{equation}
However, because the transformation (\ref{trans}) involves a
$U(1)$ weight term, an additional factor is needed in the measure when
$q\ne0$. Let us replace $\Phi$ by $\Phi_{(q)}$ to remind us that $\Phi$
carries $U(1)$ charge $q$. Then the following bilinear form is
$SU(n|1)$ invariant:
\begin{equation}
||\Phi_{(q)}||^2=
\int\! d\mu \left[1 + \bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{-q}
|\Phi_{(q)}|^2\,.
\label{norm2}
\end{equation}
Note that the additional factor in the measure is unity precisely when
$q=0$ but is non-trivial otherwise.

In terms of the original wave-functions $\Psi =
\left[1+ \bar\xi\cdot \xi\right]^{-{\gamma\over 2}}\Phi_{(q)}$, the
$SU(n|1)$ invariant
scalar product corresponding to the definition (\ref{norm2}) reads
\begin{equation}
<\Omega|\Psi> =\int\! d\mu_0 \left[1 + \bar\xi\cdot\xi\right]^{\kappa}
\Omega^{\dagger}\Psi \label{scalprod}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \gamma - q + n-1 \label{kappa}
\end{equation}
and $\Omega(\xi, \bar\xi)$ is another vector in the same `Hilbert space'.
It is straightforward to check that the quantum generators (\ref{quantS})
are mutually conjugate with respect to this scalar product
\begin{equation}
\left(<\Omega|\hat{S}_i|\Psi>\right)^\dagger = <\Psi|\hat{\bar S}{}^i
|\Omega >\,.
\label{selfS}
\end{equation}
On the other hand, for $\kappa \neq 0$ the fermionic momentum operators
$\partial/\partial \xi^i$ and
$\partial/ \partial \bar\xi^i$ are not mutually conjugate with
respect to
(\ref{scalprod}). Note, however, that (\ref{scalprod}) is defined modulo
the following similarity transformation (change of basis) in
`Hilbert space'
\begin{equation}
\Psi{} =\left[1+ \bar\xi\cdot \xi\right]^{\lambda }\Psi{}'_{(\lambda)}\,,
\quad
\Omega {} =\left[1+ \bar\xi\cdot \xi\right]^{\lambda }\Omega{}'_{(\lambda)}
\,,
\quad (\lambda^\dagger = \lambda)\,. \label{basises}
\end{equation}
This amounts to the substitution  $\Omega, \Psi \rightarrow \Omega{}',
\Psi{}'$ and
shift $\kappa \rightarrow \kappa + 2 \lambda$ in the definition
(\ref{scalprod}), as well as a corresponding change in the observables.
The conjugacy property (\ref{selfS}) of the $SU(n|1)$ supersymmetry
generators is evidently basis-independent. In contrast, an analogous
conjugacy property holds for the fermionic momentum operators only for
the special choice of basis corresponding to $\lambda = - \kappa/2$:
\begin{equation}
\left(<\Omega{}'_{(-\kappa/2)}|\partial/\partial
\xi^i|\Psi{}'_{(-\kappa/2)}>\right)^\dagger =
<\Psi{}'_{(-\kappa/2)}|\partial/\partial
\bar\xi_i|\Omega{}'_{(-\kappa/2)}>\,.
\label{selfpi}
\end{equation}
Thus, the fermionic momentum operators (\ref{conjugacy}) are mutually
conjugate in the sense that there is a basis in `Hilbert space' for
which they satisfy (\ref{selfpi}).

Let us now turn to the analysis of the field content of $\Phi$ implied by
the invariant norm (\ref{norm2}).
In general, there are contributions to (\ref{norm2}) from all coefficients
in the expansion (\ref{expansion}), but zero norm states occur for special
values of $q$. For example, when $q=n-1$ we have
\begin{equation}
||\Phi_{(n-1)}||^2 = |c_{(n)}|^2\,. \label{coeff22}
\end{equation}
As $\delta_\epsilon c_{(n)} = 0$ for this choice of $q$ we see that the
physical Hilbert space is an $SU(n|1)$ singlet. All functions
$\Phi_{(n-1)}$ with $c_{(n)}=0$ have zero norm. If instead we set
$q= n-2$ then we find
\begin{equation}
||\Phi_{(n-2)}||^2 = |c_n|^2 -{\bar c_{(n-1)}}^{\;\;i} c_{(n-1)\,i}\,.
\label{coeff}
\end{equation}
Again there are zero norm states because the $SU(n)$ representation
content appearing in the norm is restricted to ${\bf n} \oplus {\bf 1}$;
these $SU(n)$ representations combine to form the fundamental ${\bf
n+1}$  representation of $SU(n|1)$. As a final example, consider $q=0$.
In this case we have
\begin{equation}
||\Phi_{(0)}||^2 = (-1)^n (n-1)!
\sum^n_{k=1} (-1)^k \, k\,\, \bar c_{(k)\,i_1\ldots i_k}\,
c^{\;\;\;i_1\ldots i_k}_{(k)}\,. \label{generic}
\end{equation}
The $SU(n)$ representation content is
${\bf n} \oplus {\bf n(n-1)}/2  \oplus \ldots \oplus {\bf n} \oplus {\bf
1}$.

An inspection of the transformations (\ref{transcomp}) leads to the
following general conclusions about the structure of the `Hilbert
spaces' corresponding to different choices of $q$. For the
choice
\begin{equation}\label{condirr}
q= (\hat{k} -1)\,,
\end{equation}
for integer $\hat{k}$ in the range $0 \leq \hat{k} \leq n$ (the
examples
above correspond to $\hat{k} = n,n-1,1$, respectively) there is an invariant
irreducible subspace spanned by
\begin{equation}\label{set}
c_{(\hat{k})}^{i_1\ldots i_{\hat{k}}}\,, \dots\,, c^{i_1\ldots i_n}_{(n)}~.
\label{irr}
\end{equation}
For $\hat{k}=0$ this subspace is the full space of coefficients of $\Phi$
but
otherwise it is not, and the remaining coefficients are transformed into
the above set; this shows that the representation of $SU(n|1)$ carried
by $\Phi_{(\hat{k}-1)}$ is reducible but not fully reducible. The norm
$||\Phi_{(\hat{k}-1)}||$ includes only the components (\ref{irr}), so there
exist zero norm states unless $\hat{k}=0$.

As the set (\ref{set}) is irreducible
under the action of $SU(n|1)$, we can consistently set them to zero:
\begin{equation}
c_{(\hat{k})}^{i_1\ldots i_{\hat{k}}} = c_{(\hat{k} +1)}^{i_1\ldots
i_{\hat{k} +1}} =
\;\dots\; =
c^{i_1\ldots i_n}_{(n)} = 0~. \label{constrirr}
\end{equation}
The complementary set of coefficients then forms an irreducible
set on its own, and one would expect there to exist a corresponding
$SU(n|1)$-invariant norm. However, the `obvious' norm, defined by
(\ref{norm2}), is identically zero when (\ref{constrirr}) is satisfied;
this is easily seen by rewriting (\ref{constrirr}) in the superfield form
\begin{equation}
\label{superfconstr}
{\partial^{\hat{k}}\Phi_{(q)}\over \partial \bar\xi_{i_1}\ldots
\partial \bar\xi_{i_{\hat{k}}}} = 0\, \qquad (\mbox{and c.c.})\,.
\end{equation}
One can check that these constraints are covariant under (\ref{trans})
provided that the condition (\ref{condirr}) holds. Of course, they do not
correspond to constraints in the Lagrangian (\ref{lagphase}) so what we
are now doing cannot be considered as a quantization of {\it that}
Lagrangian but one could add to it the classical
constraints corresponding to (\ref{superfconstr}), for which the constraint
functions are polynomials in $\bar\pi$.

It is remarkable that for $\Phi_{(\hat{k}-1)}$ constrained
by (\ref{superfconstr}) there exists the following {\it alternative} norm
\begin{equation}\label{alternnorm}
|||\tilde{\Phi}_{(\hat{k}-1)}|||^2 = \int d\mu_0 \,(1 + \bar\xi\cdot\xi)^{n
-
\hat{k}}\,
\ln (1 + \bar\xi\cdot \xi)
\,\tilde{\bar{\Phi}}_{(\hat{k}-1)} \tilde{\Phi}_{(\hat{k}-1)}\,.
\end{equation}
Taking into account that
\begin{equation}
\delta_\epsilon \ln (1 + \bar\xi\cdot \xi) = \left(\bar\epsilon\cdot \xi -
\epsilon\cdot \bar\xi \right) \,,
\end{equation}
it is straightforward to prove invariance of (\ref{alternnorm}) given
the constraints (\ref{superfconstr}), which are crucial to the result.
It is interesting that the `Lagrangian density' in (\ref{alternnorm}) is
not a tensor one as in (\ref{norm2}), but has an additional variation into
a total derivative, as is typical for WZ or Chern-Simons lagrangians.

\section{$n=2$ and BRST}


We shall now illustrate the above results with the $n=2$ case;
we also choose $\gamma=1$, which means that the `natural' choice of
operator ordering corresponds to $q=1$. For $n=2$ we can interpret
the odd coset space $SU(2|1)/U(2)$ as a BRST superspace because
$SU(2|1)\cong OSp(2|2)$ is the Euclidean BRST supergroup.  For $n=2$
we have
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{(q)} = a + \bar\xi_i b^i + \bar\xi_1\bar\xi_2 c~.
\end{equation}
The coefficients $(b^1,b^2)$, which form an $SU(2)$ doublet, can be
interpreted as (euclidean) Faddeev-Popov ghost and antighost for the
$SU(2)$-singlet gauge-fixing term $a$; the other $SU(2)$ singlet $c$
is then the `Nakanishi-Lautrup' auxiliary field.

>From (\ref{transcomp}) we deduce that the
$SU(2|1)$-supersymmetry transformations for $q=0$ are
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\epsilon a &=& -\bar\epsilon_i b^i\,, \nonumber \\
\delta_\epsilon b^i &=& -\varepsilon^{ij}\bar\epsilon_j c\,,\nonumber \\
\delta_\epsilon c &=& \varepsilon_{ij} \epsilon^i b^j\,, \label{tr21}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\varepsilon_{12} = \varepsilon^{12} = 1, \;
\varepsilon^{ik}\varepsilon_{il} = \delta^k_l$.
This is not a reducible representation because $a$ transforms
non-trivially while $(b_1,b_2,c)$ span a 3-dimensional invariant subspace.
Observe that
\begin{equation}
||\Phi_{(0)}||^2 = |c|^2  + b^i\bar b_i\label{norm21}
\end{equation}
is invariant. Of course, this is not really a norm
as the variables $b^i$ are anticommuting.\footnote{For odd $n$ this
feature presents a difficulty because in this case the $c_{(n)}$ are
Grassmann odd and the $c^i_{(n-1)}$ are Grassmann even, but this
difficulty is overcome by changing the Grassmann parity of $\Phi$;
this is why we earlier required $\Psi$ and $\Phi$
to be even for $n= 2k$ and odd for $n=2k+1$. With this definition,
the norm for bosonic variables is always positive semi-definite.}
In other words, the physical states are vectors in a vector superspace
of dimension $(1|2)$ transforming as the fundamental representation of
$SU(2|1)\,$.

For $q=1$ the transformations (\ref{tr21}) become
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\epsilon a &=& -\bar\epsilon_i b^i\,, \nonumber \\
\delta_\epsilon b^i &=& -\varepsilon^{ij}\bar\epsilon_j c + \epsilon^i
a\,,\nonumber \\
\delta_\epsilon c &=& 0\,.\label{tr22}
\end{eqnarray}
This is the `natural' case for which the physical Hilbert space is a
singlet. Indeed, the  norm (\ref{norm2}) in this case is simply
\begin{equation}
||\Phi_{(1)}||^2 = |c|^2\,.
\end{equation}

Still with $q=1$, we may impose the covariant condition
\begin{equation}
c = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
\frac{\;\;\partial^2 \tilde{\Phi}_{(1)}}{\partial \bar\xi_{i}\partial
\bar\xi_k} = 0~.
\end{equation}
This leaves us with the irreducible multiplet $(a, b^i)$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\epsilon a &=& -\bar\epsilon_i b^i\,, \nonumber \\
\delta_\epsilon b^i &=& \epsilon^i a\,.
\end{eqnarray}
The alternative norm is
\begin{eqnarray}
|||\tilde{\Phi}_{(1)}|||^2 &=& - \int d\mu_0\,\ln (1 +\bar\xi\cdot \xi)\,
\tilde{\bar\Phi}_{(1)}\tilde\Phi_{(1)} \nonumber \\
&=& |a|^2 + \bar b_i b^i \label{norm3}
\end{eqnarray}
so physical states once again transform as a fundamental $({\bf 1} + {\bf
2})$ representation of $SU(2|1)$ (the precise correspondence with the
realization
(\ref{tr21}), (\ref{norm21}) is achieved via substitutions $a \rightarrow
\bar{\tilde{c}}$,
$b^i  \rightarrow \epsilon^{ik}\bar{\tilde{b}}_k$, where $\tilde{c}$ and
$\tilde{b^i}$
are transformed just as $c$ and $b^i$).

Finally, we shall consider $q=-1$, for which the transformation law
(\ref{trans}) becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_\epsilon a &=& -\bar\epsilon_i b^i\,, \nonumber \\
\delta_\epsilon b^i &=& -\varepsilon^{ij}\bar\epsilon_j c - \epsilon^i
a\,,\nonumber \\
\delta_\epsilon c &=& 2\,\varepsilon_{ij} \epsilon^i b^j\, \label{tr23}
\end{eqnarray}
and the invariant norm calculated by the formula (\ref{norm2}) is
\begin{equation}
||\Phi_{(-1)}||^2 = |c|^2 + 2|a|^2 - 2\bar b_ib^i~.
\end{equation}
In this case one cannot single out any invariant subspace and
so ends up with a 4-dimensional irreducible multiplet $(b_1, b_2, c,
a)$ of $SU(2|1)$.

\section{Discussion}

We have shown that the mechanics of $n$ free complex Grassmann-odd variables
provides a non-linear realization of the supergroup $SU(n|1)$. It can be
viewed as the mechanics of a `particle' with the Grassmann-odd coset space
$SU(n|1)/U(n)$ as its phase space. This model is trivial in the sense that
its Hamiltonian vanishes but it is the simplest of a class of models that
realize $SU(n|1)$ non-linearly and for which the Hamiltonian is generically
non-zero. The particle on $SU(2|1)/[U(1)\times U(1)]$ is an example, and
one that will be considered in a future publication. Part of the
motivation of this paper was to exhibit some of the properties of these
models in the simplest possible setting. Another motivation is that
coset-spaces of the $n=2$ supergroup $SU(2|1)$ can be interpreted as
BRST superspaces.

We have shown that there exists an alternative quantization of the
`free fermion' model that implements the classical $SU(n|1)$ symmetry. In
contrast to the standard quantization, for which the states transform as a
spinor of $SO(2n)$, the states of the alternative quantum theory are vectors
in a vector superspace transforming under $SU(n|1)$. The specific
$SU(n|1)$ representation content depends on the resolution of an operator
ordering ambiguity, which amounts to a choice of $U(1)$ charge for the
wave-function. There is a natural choice, given the initial classical
Lagrangian, because this Lagrangian can be viewed as a WZ term for
$U(1)\subset SU(n|1)$ and this leads to specific shift in the $U(1)$
generator that is naturally identified with the $U(1)$ charge of the
quantum wave-function. For this choice, and a particular
choice of the `coupling constant',  the `Hilbert' space contains
zero norm states and the physical `Hilbert' space is an $SU(n|1)$
singlet.

For other choices of $U(1)$ charge assignment (and other choices of
coupling constant) one gets other representations of $SU(n|1)$,
picked out by an
$SU(n|1)$ invariant norm. We showed that there exists a class of integer
$U(1)$ charge assignments for which the representation is irreducible.
Remarkably, in this case the complementary representation contained in
the wave-function, again irreducible, could be picked out by a
different invariant, but not manifestly-invariant, norm provided that
the original representation was constrained to be absent; this case
corresponds to the quantization of the original free-fermion
Lagrangian with additional phase space constraints.

Any quantization of Grassmann-odd variables has to take into account
(explicitly or implicitly) second-class phase-space constraints. In our
case these were non-trivial because of a redefinition of variables needed
for analyticity of the $SU(n|1)$ transformations. We dealt with these
constraints by a variant of the `gauge unfixing' method involving a
separation of the constraints into analytic and anti-analytic
subsets in involution. It may be helpful if we sketch here how this
method can be used to covariantly quantize the massless 4D
superparticle, as done in \cite{Frydr,Dima}. The fermionic constraint
operators are the
supercovariant derivatives $D_\alpha$ and their complex conjugates $\bar
D_{\dot\alpha}$. These are not all second class (given $p^2=0$) because
the combinations $p^{\alpha\dot\alpha}\bar D_{\dot\alpha}$ and
$p^{\alpha\dot\alpha}D_\alpha$ are first class. Although we should
require that both of these first class operators annihilate physical
states $\Phi$ we need only impose $p^{\alpha\dot\alpha} D_{\alpha}\Phi=0$
explicitly if we also impose $\bar D_{\dot\alpha}\Phi=0$, as required for
`analytic quantization', because the other one is then implied. The
independent constraints are therefore $\bar D_{\dot\alpha}\Phi=0$ and
$p^{\alpha\dot\alpha} D_{\alpha}\Phi=0$ (because these imply $p^2=0$), but
these are just the free field equations for a massless chiral superfield.
