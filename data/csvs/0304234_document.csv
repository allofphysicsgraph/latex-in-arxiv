Moduli spaces of conformal field theories corresponding 
to current-current deformations are discussed. For WZW models, 
CFT and sigma model considerations are compared. It is shown 
that current-current deformed WZW models have WZW-like sigma model 
descriptions with non-bi-invariant metrics, additional $B$-fields
and a non-trivial dilaton.

\section{Introduction}
%
Moduli spaces of conformal field theories are important objects
in the study of two dimensional quantum field theories because
they describe critical subspaces in the space of coupling constants.
In string theories, whose small coupling limits are described by conformal field theories,
these moduli spaces arise as parameter spaces of string vacua. The 
understanding of moduli spaces of conformal field theories is thus a very important issue for
string theory. 

Although conformal field theories are quite well understood, there are
only few examples of explicitly known moduli spaces at present, most of which
correspond to free field theories as e.g. toroidal conformal field theories 
or orbifolds thereof. 

The reason for this is that a good conceptual understanding of
deformations of conformal field theories beyond conformal perturbation
theory is still lacking. Perturbation theory is usually technically involved, 
at least when one wants to obtain higher order contributions, and hence
is only applicable to study CFT moduli spaces in small neighbourhoods of 
explicitly known models. In particular it is in general not possible 
to obtain global information about the moduli spaces from perturbation
theory, except in situations, where symmetry as e.g. supersymmetry is
preserved by the corresponding deformations.

In this article, special deformations of conformal field theories, namely those
generated by perturbations with products of holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents are studied.
As was shown in \cite{Chaudhuri:1988qb}, such deformations preserve the algebras 
of the perturbing fields. Indeed, this gives enough structure to determine 
global properties of the subspaces of moduli spaces corresponding to this kind
of deformations. 

Important examples of non-free conformal field theories 
admitting current-current deformations are WZW models (see
e.g. \cite{Gepner:1986wi}). The corresponding moduli spaces for WZW models 
associated to compact semi-simple Lie groups, will be discussed in detail.

Since WZW models have descriptions as sigma models on Lie groups,
it is a natural question if there are such descriptions for all
conformal field theories from these moduli spaces. 
In fact, families of sigma models containing WZW models at special
points have been discussed by many 
authors (e.g.\ in
\cite{Hassan:1992gi,Giveon:1993ph,Sfetsos:1993ka,Kiritsis:1993ju,Gershon:1993wu}).
In particular one-parameter families of sigma models 
containing the ${\rm SU}(2)$-WZW models have been studied very explicitly by
Giveon and Kiritsis  \cite{Giveon:1993ph}, who also compared them
to the families of current-current deformed ${\rm SU}(2)$-WZW models which were
described in \cite{Yang:1988bi}. 
Ideas about a generalization of these 
considerations to arbitrary WZW models have also been presented in
\cite{Giveon:1993ph,Kiritsis:1993ju,Kiritsis:1991zt}.

In this article, WZW-like sigma model representations 
of current-current deformed WZW models will be
explicitly constructed.  
These are sigma models with the same target space as the
``undeformed'' WZW model in the family, but 
with different (in general not bi-invariant) metrics and additional $B$-fields. 

Thus, we obtain explicit descriptions of the moduli spaces of
current-current deformed WZW models associated to compact semi-simple Lie groups
in terms of conformal field theories as well as in terms of sigma models. 

In section two, exactly marginal current-current deformations of conformal
field theories are discussed.
We start from the facts obtained in \cite{Chaudhuri:1988qb},
that perturbations of conformal field theories
with products of holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents are exactly 
marginal iff the holomorphic as well as the antiholomorphic currents 
belong to commutative current algebras, and that in this case
these holomorphic and antiholomorphic current algebras are preserved
under the deformations. 
This can be used to reduce the problem of studying finite current-current deformations
to first order deformation theory, which is carried out in \ref{deformationtheory}, 
and from which it follows that the 
effect of these deformations on the CFT structures is completely captured by
pseudo orthogonal transformations of their charge lattices with respect 
to the preserved commutative current algebras. 
The corresponding deformation spaces can thus be described by
\beq
{\cal D}\simeq{\rm O}(d,{\bar{d}})/{\rm O}(d)\times{\rm O}(\bar{d})\,.
\eeq
This generalizes the deformation results of toroidal conformal field 
theories \cite{Dijkgraaf:jt}.
The corresponding moduli spaces are obtained from the deformation spaces
by taking the quotients with respect to ``duality groups''.

In section three we discuss an important class of examples, namely WZW models
corresponding to compact semi-simple Lie-groups.
The general results from section two are compared to a realization of
deformed WZW models obtained from a representation of WZW models as 
orbifolds of products of generalized parafermionic 
and toroidal models given in \cite{Gepner:1987sm}. 

In section four we discuss various aspects of exactly marginal
deformations of WZW models from a sigma model perspective. This
approach is best suited for a semiclassical treatment and in that
sense less powerful than the algebraic one. However, it can illustrate
the results and provide a picture for the class of deformed models. 
Exactly marginal deformations of WZW models from the sigma model
perspective have been discussed in the past mainly for rank one
groups \cite{Hassan:1992gi,Giveon:1993ph,Sfetsos:1993ka} and for models
where coordinates can be chosen 
such that the relevant set of chiral and anti-chiral currents follows
manifestly from the equations of motion \cite{Henningson:1992rn}.

Mimicking the orbifold realization of deformed WZW models described
in section three, we will consider an orbifold of a direct product
consisting of a vectorially gauged WZW model and a 
{\it d}-dimensional torus model, where {\it d} is the rank of the group. 
Since a sigma model is not very well designed to accommodate orbifolds, we perform an
axial-vector duality (generalized T-duality) to obtain a dual
description without an additional orbifold action. To this end, we
first implement the orbifold by gauging in addition an axial symmetry
of the WZW model combined with shifts in the torus factor. We force
the corresponding gauge bundle to be flat but choose the zero modes of
the corresponding Lagrange multiplier such that the gauge bundle is
twisted in a non-trivial way. It turns out that integrating out the
gauge bundle instead of the Lagrange multiplier provides a sigma model
without an additional orbifold action. The result is a ``WZW-like''
model, i.e.\ a sigma model with Lie group as target space, and
an action given by a WZW action in which the bi-invariant metric is
replaced by a more general bilinear form which is neither bi-invariant nor necessarily
symmetric.

The same sigma models can be obtained as coset models of a 
product of the original WZW model and {\it d}-dimensional torus models
with gauge group ${\rm U}(1)^d$, embedded into both factors.

All the sigma model manipulations described so far are 
carried out at a classical level. Quantum
mechanically one should replace the procedure of solving equations of
motion by performing Gaussian integrals. These in general provide
functional determinants, which in turn generate a non-trivial
dilaton. In a pragmatic approach this can be computed by imposing
conformal invariance, i.e.\ requiring vanishing beta functions. 
We will use a more elegant way consisting of a comparison of the
Hamiltonian of the model and a generalized Laplacian, which depends 
on the dilaton \cite{Tseytlin:1993my}. 

Finally, we illustrate some of the results in the 
example of the deformed ${\rm SU}(2)$-WZW model.

We should mention that many of the employed techniques
can be found in the literature. The corresponding references will be
given in the text.

\section{Current-Current Deformations of CFTs}
\label{ccdef}
%

Although not proven in general, it is widely believed that all deformations
of conformal field theories are generated by perturbations of the
theories with marginal fields, i.e. fields ${\cal O}_i$ with conformal
weights $h({\cal O}_i)=1=\overline{h}({\cal O}_i)$. 

The perturbed correlation functions on a conformal 
surface $\Sigma$ of a combination of 
operators $X(p_1,\ldots,p_k)$, $p_i\in\Sigma$ are defined to be
\beq\el{deformation}
\bra X(p_1,\ldots,p_k)\ket_\Sigma^\lambda:=\bra X(p_1,\ldots,p_k)
\exp{\left(\sum_i\lambda_i\int_\Sigma {\cal O}_i d\mu_\Sigma\right)}
\ket_\Sigma\,,  
\eeq
where the integrals have to be regularized due to the appearance of
singularities. If the perturbed correlation functions
define a quantum field theory, which is a fixed point of the
renormalization group flow, it is again a conformal field theory. This
however is not the case in general. Indeed, 
preservation of conformal invariance by perturbations gives non linear
restrictions on the fields, which generate it (see
e.g. \cite{Dijkgraaf:jt}).  
This means that the set of
exactly marginal fields, i.e. those which generate deformations of conformal 
field theories are not vector spaces in general. In particular the
deformation spaces 
of conformal field theories need not necessarily be manifolds but may have 
singularities. (For more details on conformal deformation theory see
e.g. \cite{Dijkgraaf:jt,Kutasov:1988xb,Ranganathan:1992nb,Ranganathan:1993vj}).  

In the following, deformations of conformal field theories generated
by a special class of marginal  
fields, namely products of holomorphic and antiholomorphic currents
will be discussed.  
These are simple enough to give a global description of 
the deformation spaces corresponding to them 
and to express the data of deformed CFTs explicitly in terms of the data of 
the undeformed ones.

We consider conformal field theories, whose holomorphic 
and antiholomorphic $W$-algebras contain current algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_k$, 
$\hat{\overline{\mathfrak{g}}}_{\overline{k}}$ corresponding to Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\overline{\mathfrak{g}}$ and
$k,\overline{k}\in\ensuremath{\mathbb{N}}$, i.e.
for every $j,j\p \in \mathfrak{g}$ there exist holomorphic fields $j(z),j\p(z)$ of 
conformal weight $h=1$ in the theory, such that
\beqn\el{currentalg}
j(z)j\p(w)={k K_{\mathfrak{g}}(j,j\p)\over (z-w)^2}+{[j,j\p](w)\over (z-w)}+{\rm reg}\\
T(z)j(w)={j(w)\over (z-w)^2}+{\partial j(w)\over (z-w)}+{\rm reg}\,,\nonumber
\eeqn
where $K_{\mathfrak{g}}(.,.)$ is a bi-invariant scalar product on $\mathfrak{g}$ and
$[.,.]$ its Lie bracket.  
The holomorphic energy momentum tensor $T(z)$ can be written as
\beq
T(z)=T_0(z)+{1\over 2(k+\check{g})}
\sum_{\alpha,\beta} \kappa^g_{\alpha\beta}:\!j^\alpha(z)j^\beta(z)\!:\,,
\quad \kappa^\mathfrak{g}:=K^{-1}_\mathfrak{g}\,,
\eeq
with $\check{g}$ the dual Coxeter number of $\mathfrak{g}$,
$(j^\alpha)_\alpha$ a basis of $\mathfrak{g}$ and $T_0(z)j(w)={\rm reg}$.
The same holds for the antiholomorphic current algebra with $(\mathfrak{g},k)$ replaced
by $(\bar{\mathfrak{g}},\bar{k})$.

In particular, there is a subspace of the CFT Hilbert space isomorphic to 
$\mathfrak{g}\otimes\overline{\mathfrak{g}}$ of marginal fields. However, not all of these fields
are exactly marginal. As was shown in \cite{Chaudhuri:1988qb}, such
fields are exactly marginal if and only if, under the isomorphism
above, they correspond to elements of $\mathfrak{a}\otimes\overline{\mathfrak{a}}$, 
for any abelian subalgebras $\mathfrak{a}\subset\mathfrak{g}$,
$\overline{\mathfrak{a}}\subset\overline{\mathfrak{g}}$. Moreover deformations 
generated by these exactly marginal fields preserve the current
algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{a}}$, $\hat{\overline{\mathfrak{a}}}$ corresponding to $\mathfrak{a}$, $\overline{\mathfrak{a}}$.

Hence, every pair of abelian $\hat{u}(1)^d\simeq \mathfrak{a}\subset \mathfrak{g}$, 
$\hat{\overline{u}}(1)^{\overline{d}}\simeq\overline{\mathfrak{a}}\subset\overline{\mathfrak{g}}$ gives rise to a
family of  
conformal field theories with current algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{a}}$, $\hat{\overline{\mathfrak{a}}}$.
All these families meet in the original model. 
Since conformal field theories are invariant under automorphisms of their
holomorphic and antiholomorphic $W$-algebras, pairs which are identified
under such automorphisms give rise to equivalent deformations.

We assume in the following that the conformal field theory is unitary,
and its Hilbert space  
decomposes into tensor products of
irreducible highest weight representations $\ensuremath{\mathcal{V}}_Q$, $\overline{\ensuremath{\mathcal{V}}}_{\overline{Q}}$ of 
$\hat{\mathfrak{a}}$, $\hat{\overline{\mathfrak{a}}}$, which are characterized
by their charges $Q\in \mathfrak{a}^*$, $\overline{Q}\in\overline{\mathfrak{a}}^*$, and whose lowest
conformal 
weights are given by $h_Q={1\over 2}\kappa(Q,Q)$, $\overline{h}={1\over
  2}\overline{\kappa}(\overline{Q},\overline{Q})$, as can 
be read off from \eq{currentalg}\footnote{From now on $\kappa={1\over
    k}\kappa^\mathfrak{g}|_\mathfrak{a}$, $\overline{\kappa}={1\over
    k}\kappa^{\overline{\mathfrak{g}}}|_{\overline{\mathfrak{a}}}$.}: 
\beq\el{decomp}
\ensuremath{\mathcal{H}}\simeq
\bigoplus_{(Q,\overline{Q})\in\Lambda}\ensuremath{\mathcal{H}}_{Q\overline{Q}}\otimes\ensuremath{\mathcal{V}}_Q\otimes
\overline{\ensuremath{\mathcal{V}}}_{\overline{Q}}\,.   
\eeq
The set of charges $\Lambda\subset \mathfrak{a}^*\times \overline{\mathfrak{a}}^*$ forms a lattice
equipped with bilinear pairing  
$\bra.,.\ket:=\kappa-\overline{\kappa}$. 

As is shown in \ref{deformationtheory}, deformations corresponding to
pairs $(\mathfrak{a},\overline{\mathfrak{a}})$ only affect the representation 
theory of the $W$-algebras $\hat{\mathfrak{a}}$, $\hat{\overline{\mathfrak{a}}}$, but not the
OPE-coefficients of $\hat{\mathfrak{a}}\times\hat{\overline{\mathfrak{a}}}$-highest  
weight vectors. More precisely, if one chooses suitable connections on
the bundles of Hilbert spaces over the 
deformation spaces \cite{Ranganathan:1993vj}, the effect of the
deformations on the 
CFT structures 
is completely captured by transformations of the charge
lattices $\Lambda$ in the identity component ${\rm O}(d,\overline{d})_0$ of the
pseudo orthogonal group ${\rm O}(d,\overline{d})$, and all structures
independent of the charges 
are parallel with respect to the chosen connection.

That these ${\rm O}(d,\overline{d})_0$-transformations indeed give rise to 
new modular invariant partition functions and also preserve
locality is easy to see even without any perturbation theory. 
Locality is maintained because of the preservation of 
$\kappa-\overline{\kappa}$ by transformations $O\in {\rm O}(d,\overline{d})$. 
To show the preservation of modular invariance 
we consider the torus partition function depending on modular parameters
$\tau$ and $\overline{\tau}$ ($q=e^{2\pi i\tau}$, $\overline{q}=e^{-2\pi i \overline{\tau}}$)
of the $O(t)$-transformed model along a smooth path
$O:[-1,1]\rightarrow {\rm O}(d,\overline{d})_0$ with $O(0)=1$,  
$\partial_t O(t)\big|_{t=0}=T\in o(d,\overline{d})$
\beqn
Z^{O(t)}(q,\overline{q})&:=&{\rm tr}_\ensuremath{\mathcal{H}}\left(q^{L_0^{O(t)} -{c\over
    12}}\overline{q}^{\overline{L}_0^{O(t)}-{c\over 12}}
