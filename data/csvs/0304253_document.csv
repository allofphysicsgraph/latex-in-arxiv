We construct consistent non-linear Kaluza Klein reduction ansatze for
a subset of fields arising from the reduction of IIB$^*$ and M$^*$ theory
on dS$_5\times H^5$ and dS$_4\times$AdS$_7$, respectively.  These reductions
yield four and five-dimensional de Sitter supergravities, albeit with wrong
sign kinetic terms.  We also demonstrate that the ansatze may be used to
lift multi-centered de Sitter black hole solutions to ten and eleven
dimensions.  The lifted dS$_5$ black holes correspond to rotating E4-branes
of IIB$^*$ theory.

\section{Introduction}

The recent observations on the acceleration of the universe has led to
renewed interest in de Sitter backgrounds in cosmology.  At the same
time, this has led to much debate on whether de Sitter space itself is
in fact compatible with M-theory.  Although several arguments may be
made against this possibility, it should be noted that de Sitter spaces
naturally arise as backgrounds for the * theories of
\cite{Hull:1998vg,Hull2,Hull3,Hull4,Hull}.  These * theories are obtained
through a timelike T-duality of the ordinary string theories, and admit an
unconventional effective field theory description involving wrong sign
kinetic energy terms for the RR fields.  Because of this and other
problems, the field theory limits of the * theories appear ill-defined.
Nevertheless, so long as one allows T-duality along a timelike circle,
one must allow for the existence of such * theories as a component of the
full M-theory.  It is in this spirit that we choose to investigate the
de Sitter supergravities which arise as consistent dimensional
reductions of IIB$^*$ and M$^*$ theory.

Conventional wisdom indicates that de Sitter space is
incompatible with supersymmetry.  This may be seen, for example, in
the standard classification of possible supersymmetry algebras, which allows
for both Poincar\'e and anti-de Sitter superalgebras, but not for the
possibility of a de Sitter superalgebra.  Thus in order to obtain de
Sitter supersymmetry, one must relax one or more of the usual assumptions.
Such possibilities were first generally studied in \cite{Lukierski,Pilch}.
In the present case, the de Sitter supergravities which we investigate
are unconventional in that they have wrong sign kinetic energy terms
as well as non-compact gaugings.  Of course, unitary theories do exist
with non-compact gaugings.  However, as will be explained below, the
non-compact symmetries which we consider here are of a different
nature, and yield mixed sign kinetic terms for the gauge fields.
While these properties of the de Sitter supergravities are clearly
undesirable, they follow as a natural consequence of the underlying *
theory.  As a result, we leave open the possibility that such de Sitter
supergravities would be of relevance for the * theory beyond the
field theory limit.  It is, however, possible that the effective field
theories which we explore, being unstable, do not provide an adequate
description of the full * theory.  Nevertheless, one may hope to gain
additional insight into de Sitter space and supersymmetry regardless of
the ultimate fate of the * theories.

For the case of anti-de Sitter supersymmetry, it has long been known
that a generalized Freund-Rubin compactification yields backgrounds of
the form AdS$\times$Sphere.  Furthermore, a linearized Kaluza-Klein
analysis indicates that the zero mode fluctuations about the
AdS$\times$Sphere background gives rise to a maximal gauged supergravity
in the lower dimensional AdS space.  More recently, various full and
truncated non-linear Kaluza-Klein reductions have been constructed,
demonstrating the consistent embedding of the corresponding gauged
supergravities in the higher dimensional theory
\cite{deWit,Cvetic,Nastase:1999cb,Nastase,Lu:1999bc,Lu:1999bw,Cvetic:1999au,Cvetic:1999xx,Cvetic:2000eb,Cvetic2,Cvetic:2000dm}.
Based on the observation that such gauged supergravities yield a
negative cosmological constant of the form $\Lambda\sim-g^2$, one may at
least formally obtain a de Sitter supergravity through the analytic
continuation to imaginary coupling constant, namely $g\to i\hat g$.
While we follow this approach in spirit, it is important to note that
the de Sitter supergravities discussed here (being descended from *
theories) have only real bosonic fields and real gauge couplings
(although Majorana conditions on the fermions may have to be relaxed).

The non-linear Kaluza-Klein ansatze for the conventional sphere reductions
allow the embedding of various lower-dimensional solutions into the
underlying higher-dimensional theories.  For example, R-charged AdS black
holes may be lifted to ten and eleven dimensions, where they take on the
nature of rotating branes \cite{Cvetic}.  Similarly, the consistent
reductions constructed below allow us to lift dS black holes into the
original * theory.  In particular, multi-centered dS black holes have been
constructed in \cite{Kastor:1992nn,London}; these were furthermore
shown to satisfy an unconventional supersymmetry involving the imaginary
coupling constant mentioned above \cite{London,Liu}.  Here we demonstrate
that such dS black holes provide an interesting cosmological background for
* theory and furthermore investigate their lifting to ten or eleven dimensions.
Such multi-centered black holes have also been considered recently by
Behrndt and Cveti\v{c} as examples of time-dependent backgrounds in the
analytically continued de Sitter supergravity \cite{Behrndt}.

In the following section we describe the general procedure of obtaining
consistent reduction ansatze for * theories.  Then in sections 3 and 4
we turn to the specific cases of IIB$^*$ and M$^*$ reductions,
respectively.  The latter model is particularly interesting, as it
admits a dS$_4\times$AdS$_7$ background, whereupon either dS$_4$ or
AdS$_7$ may be viewed as the lower-dimensional spacetime.  Since both
cases arise from the same eleven-dimensional background, this hints at
some form of a dS$_4$/AdS$_7$ duality \cite{Batrachenko:2002pu}.  Finally,
we consider the
lifting of dS black holes in section 5, and conclude in section 6.

\section{Generalized sphere reductions of IIB$^*$ and M$^*$ theory}

It has been an important observation that non-dilatonic branes, in
particular the D3, M2 and M5 branes, serve as interpolating solutions
between asymptotic Minkowski and near horizon AdS$\times$Sphere
geometries (AdS$_5\times S^5$, AdS$_4\times S^7$ and AdS$_7\times S^4$,
respectively).  Alternatively, the AdS$\times$Sphere geometry directly
arises from a generalized Freund-Rubin compactification.  In several
cases, the complete non-linear Kaluza-Klein reduction corresponding to
such geometries is known.  However, it is generally more common that only
a truncated ansatz (often to a maximal Abelian subgroup of the full gauge
group, or with a subset of scalars and higher-rank potentials) has been
constructed.  Such truncated ansatze are often sufficient for the lifting
of solutions such as AdS black holes to the higher dimensional
theory.  

While it would be desirable to obtain a complete reduction, in this
paper we exclusively focus on the truncation to the sector arising from
the higher dimensional metric and $p$-form fields.  To motivate our
approach, consider the Kaluza-Klein sphere reduction ansatz to
AdS$_d\times S^n$.  In this case, the metric has the
general form \cite{Cvetic:1999xx,Cvetic:2000eb,Cvetic2}
%
\begin{equation}
ds_D^2=\Delta^{2/(d-1)}ds_d^2+g^{-2}\Delta^{-(d-3)/(d-1)}(T^{-1})^{ij}
D\mu^iD\mu^j.
\label{eq:metans}
\end{equation}
%
Here, $i$ and $j$ run from $1$ to $n+1$, and the $\mu^i$'s satisfy
the constraint $\sum_i\mu^{i\,2}=1$, corresponding to a parametrization
of $S^n$.  The $n$-sphere itself is given by the coset space
$SO(n+1)/SO(n)$, while $T_{ij}$ is a symmetric unimodular matrix
consisting of $"
