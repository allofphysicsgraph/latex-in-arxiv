The radiation from oscillating kink in (1+1) dimensional
relativistic $\phi^4$  model is considered. Both analytical and
numerical approaches are presented and the comparison between
these methods is discussed. Acceleration of the kink in external
radiation is calculated and numerical results are also presented.
