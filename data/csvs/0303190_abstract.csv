In the Matrix Quantum Mechanical formulation of 2D string theory it is
possible to introduce arbitrary tachyonic perturbations.  In the case
when the tachyonic momenta form a lattice, the theory is known to be
integrable and, therefore, it can be used to describe the
corresponding string theory. We study the backgrounds of string
theory obtained from these matrix model solutions.
They are found to be flat
but the perturbations can change the  global structure of
the target space. They can lead either to a compactification, or to
the presence of boundaries depending on the choice of boundary conditions.
Thus, we argue that the tachyon perturbations have a dual
description in terms of the unperturbed theory in spacetime with
a non-trivial global structure.
