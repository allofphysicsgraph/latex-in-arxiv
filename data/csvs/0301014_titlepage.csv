{\bf Abstract}
\end{center}
\vskip.3cm An action for a massless graviton interacting with a
massive tensor field is proposed. The model is based on coupling
the metric tensor to an $SP(4)$ gauge theory spontaneously broken
to $SL(2,C)$. The symmetry breaking is achieved by using a Higgs
multiplet containing a scalar field and a vector field related by
a constraint. We show that in the non-unitary gauge and for the
Fierz-Pauli form of the mass term, the six degrees of freedom of
the massive tensor are identified with  two tensor helicities, two
vector helicities of the Goldstone vector, and two scalars present
in the Goldstone multiplet. The propagators of this system are
well behaved, in contrast to the system consisting of two tensors.
