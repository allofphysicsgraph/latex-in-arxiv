We study four dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ $SO/SP$ supersymmetric gauge theory
on $R^3\times S^1$ deformed by a tree level superpotential. We will show that
the exact superpotential can be obtained by making use of the Lax matrix of the 
corresponding integrable model which is the periodic Toda lattice. The
connection between vacua of $SO(2N)$ and $SO(2kN-2k+2)$ can also be seen in this
framework. Similar analysis can also be applied for $SO(2N+1)$ and $SP(2N)$.
