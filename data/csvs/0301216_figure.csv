\caption{The allowed regions (shadowed) of the scalar self-coupling constant $\lambda$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $G$ for the Fermi ball to be stable against the fragmentation. We assume that the fermion $\Psi_i$ ($1\leq i\leq n$) belongs to a multiplet and the boson $\phi$ to a singlet of the internal symmetry, and that the fermion number $N_i$ is common to the flavor as $N_i=N$. The figure shows that the allowed region broadens as $n$ increases. \label{onphase.fig}}

\caption{The allowed region (shadowed) of the scalar self-coupling constant $\lambda$ (left) and the Yukawa coupling constant $G$ (right) for the Fermi ball to be stable. The assumptions are the same as those in Figure \ref{onphase.fig}. We see that the allowed regions broaden as $n$ increases. \label{glfixphase.fig}}
