\subsection{Gauge Couplings}
\label{gauge} We shall summarize the results of the gauge
coupling calculations for the model. Since the gauge couplings are
associated with different stacks of branes they do not exhibit a
conventional gauge unification. Nevertheless, the value of each
gauge coupling at the string scale is predicted in terms of a
modulus $\chi$ and the ratio of the Planck to string scales. The
running is strongly affected by the exotic matter and multiple
Higgs fields, leading to low values of the MSSM sector couplings
at low energy. However, the hidden sector groups are
asymptotically free.


The gauge coupling of the gauge field from a stack of $D6$-branes
wrapping a three-cycle is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2} = \frac{ M_s^3 V_3}{(2 \pi)^4 g_s},\label{ymc}
\end{equation}
where $M_s=1/\sqrt{\alpha'}$ is the string scale, $g_s$ is the string coupling and $V_3$ is the volume of the
three-cycle wrapped by a particular D6-brane. For our specific cases $V_3$ is given
by\footnote{The definition of  $V_3$
in (\ref{v3}) differs from one in \cite{CLS1} by a factor of $1\over 4$.
This factor has to be included, due to
  the orbifolding of $T^6$ by ${\bf Z_2\times Z_2}$,
  which is an Abelian group of order 4. This implies that the
  expressions  in \cite{CLS1} for $g_{YM}^2$ and $\alpha_G$ should
  be  increased by a factor of 4. The numerical results in
  \cite{CLS1}, which were given for $M_s \sim M_P^{(4d)}$, are
  still approximately valid for the case $M_s \sim M_P^{(4d)}/4$.}:
\begin{equation}
V_3 = {\bf \textstyle{1\over 4}} (2 \pi)^3 \prod_{i=1}^3 \sqrt{n^{i2} \left(R_1^i\right)^2
+ \hat{m}^{i2} \left(R_2^i\right)^2}\, ,\label{v3}
\end{equation}
where $R_{1,2}^i$ are the  radii of the two dimensions of the
$i^{\rm th}$ two-torus, $\hat{m}^i = m^i$ for $i=1,2$, $\hat{m}^3
= \tilde{m}^3=m^3-\textstyle{1\over 2} n^3$ (the third $T^2$ is tilted), and the wrapping numbers $(n^i,\hat{m}^i)$ are
given in Table~\ref{cycles3family}.
One can trade $g_s$ in  (\ref{ymc}) for the four-dimensional Planck-scale  $M_{P}^{(4d)}$
which is defined as the coefficient of
the Einstein term in the low energy effective action:
\begin{equation}
S_{4d} = (M_P^{(4d)})^2 \int dx^4 \sqrt{g} R + \dots =
\frac{1}{16 \pi G_N} \int dx^4 \sqrt{g} R + \dots
\end{equation}
Since $G_N^{-1/2}=1.22 \times 10^{19}\ {\rm GeV}$, we have
%$M_P^{(4d)} \sim  1.7 \times 10^{18} \ {\rm GeV}$.
$M_P^{(4d)} = \frac{1}{4 \sqrt{\pi}} \times G_N^{-1/2} = 1.7
\times 10^{18}$ GeV.
The Planck scale  is related
to the string coupling $g_s$  and string scale $M_s$ by
\begin{equation}
(M_P^{(4d)})^2 = \frac{ M_s^8 V_6 }{ (2 \pi)^7 g_s^2} \, ,\label{mpms}
\end{equation}
where $V_6$ is the total internal volume
given by
\begin{equation}
V_6 = \frac{ (2 \pi)^6}{4} \prod_{i=1}^3 R_1^i R_2^i.
\end{equation}
Again, the factor of $1\over 4$ is due to the orbifolding of
$T^6$ by ${\bf Z}_2 \times {\bf Z}_2$. This factor was included in \cite{CLS1}.
Employing (\ref{mpms}) allows us to write the gauge couplings in terms of $M_s$, $M_P^{(4d)}$,
$V_3$ and $V_6$:
\begin{equation}
g_{YM}^2=\sqrt{2\pi}{{M_s\sqrt{V_6}}\over{M_P^{(4d)}V_3}}\, ,
\end{equation}
which in terms  of the complex structure moduli $\chi_i = R_2^i/R_1^i$ becomes
\begin{equation}
g_{YM}^2 = \frac{\sqrt{8 \pi}M_s}{ M_P^{(4d)}}
\frac{\sqrt{\chi_1 \chi_2 \chi_3}}{ \prod_{i=1}^3 \sqrt{n^{i2} +
\hat{m}^{i2} \chi_i^2}}\, .
\end{equation}
The supersymmetric condition (\ref{susyratio}) implies
\begin{equation}\label{coupling}
g_{YM}^2 = \frac{4\sqrt{3 \pi} M_s}{M_P^{(4d)}}.
\frac{\chi^{3/2}}{\sqrt{[(n^1)^2 + (m^1)^2 \chi^2][ (n^2)^2 + 9
(m^2)^2 \chi^2][(n^3)^2 + 4 (\tilde{m}^3)^2 \chi^2]}},
\end{equation}
where $\chi \equiv \chi_1$.

At a scale $M$ below the string scale, the coupling $\alpha_a =
{{g_a^2}\over {4\pi}}$ of the $a^{\rm th}$ gauge factor is given (at one
loop) by
 \begin{equation}  \frac{1}{\alpha_a(M)} =
\frac{c_a(\chi)}{\alpha_G(\chi)} + \beta_a t, \label{rge1} \end{equation}
 where
\begin{equation} \alpha_G(\chi) = \sqrt{\frac{{3}}{{\pi}}} \frac{
M_s}{M_P^{(4d)}} \chi^{3/2}\, , \label{rge2}\end{equation}
 and
 \begin{equation}
t = \frac{1}{2\pi} \ln \frac{M_s}{M}. \label{rge3} \end{equation}
 The low
energy predictions for the model are given in \cite{CLS1} (There,
after correcting for the factor $1/4$ in (\ref{v3}),
$M_s \sim M_P^{(4d)}/4$ was assumed, and the low energy result
depends on one modulus parameter $\chi$.) Since we focus on the
additional confining gauge sector we state the values of $c_a$
and $\beta_a$ for these gauge couplings in Table~\ref{gaugefactors}.
In \cite{CLS1} the renormalization group  equations were studied without
the inclusion of the  chiral supermultiplets associated with the
open string sector of  the  brane.  There are three
copies of such states in the adjoint representation; they are due
to the fact that the supersymmetric cycles wrapped by D6-branes are not
rigid.
In the  Standard-model sector they     affect in a negative
way the low energy predictions for the standard model gauge couplings.
However, in the
quasi-hidden sector the only such states are associated with the $USp(4)$
gauge group, where they  change the beta function there from -5 to -2.
For  the sake of completeness we include them in the
study of gaugino condensation.

In the following subsection we shall derive the explicit complex
moduli dependence of the gauge couplings, which are suitable for
the determination of the effective non-perturbative superpotential.


\subsection{Gauge Kinetic Function and K\""ahler Potential
 in Terms of Complex Structure Moduli}

To determine the moduli dependence of the gauge
couplings in Type IIA theory with D6 branes in terms of complex
structure  moduli,  we shall employ the fact that
Type IIA theory with D6 branes is  T-dual to
 Type I theory with
D9 branes and background B-fluxes. Hence,   to arrive at
the proper definition of the moduli fields we shall  start by
writing down the moduli fields in the Type I theory with D9
branes, which  are well known (see for example \cite{Cremades}).
We then apply the duality transformations to arrive at the
moduli fields for D6 branes.

In the Type I string with D9 branes, the  real part of the  dilaton  $S$ has the
familiar expression:
\begin{equation}
Re(S)=  \frac{M_s^6 \Pi_{i=1}^{3} R_1^{i} R_2^{i}}{2\pi g_{s}}\, .
\end{equation}
 The  real part of the K\""ahler moduli  $T^i$ are
defined as
\begin{equation}
Re(T^{i}) = \frac{M_s^2 R_{1}^{i} R_2^{i}}{2\pi g_{s}}.
\end{equation}
Again, $R^{i}_{1,2}$  are the  radii of the of the $i$-th torus,
$M_s=\frac{1}{\alpha'}$ is the string scale ($\alpha'$ is the string tension) and $g_s$ is the
string coupling.



The T-duality transformations between D9 branes with B-fluxes and D6 branes
wrapped on 3-cycles are the following (see e.g., \cite{Cremades}),
\begin{equation}
{R_2^{i}} \rightarrow \frac{1}{M_s^2 R_{2}^{i}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{R_1^{i}} \rightarrow R_1^{i},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
g_{s} \rightarrow \frac{g_{s}}{M_s^3\Pi_{i=1}^3 R_2^{i}}.
\end{equation}

Under these transformations, the real part of the  dilaton
 $S$ and the complex structure moduli  $U^i$  take the following form:
\begin{equation}
Re(S) = \frac{M_s^3 \Pi_{i=1}^3R_1^{i}}{2\pi g_{s}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Re(U^{i}) = \frac{M_s^3R_{1}^{i}R_{2}^{j}R_{2}^{k}}{2\pi g_{s}},
\end{equation}
where $i\neq j\neq k$.

The expression for  $g_{YM}^2$ (\ref{ymc})  is determined  in terms of $V_3$ (\ref{v3}). The
supersymmetry constraint
for the particular model requires  the condition (\ref{susyratio}) on the
$\chi_i = \frac{R_2^{i}}{R_1^{i}}$.  It turns  out \cite{Cremades} that
these relations ensure that
the volume of the 3-cycle  $V_3$ in (\ref{v3}) can be written:
\begin{eqnarray}
V_3 &=& {\bf \textstyle{1\over 4}}(2\pi)^3(n^1n^2n^3 R_{1}^{(1)} R_{1}^{(2)}R_{1}^{(3)} -
n^1{\hat m}^2{\hat m}^3 R_{1}^{(1)} R_{2}^{(2)}R_{2}^{(3)} \cr
&-& {\hat m}^1n^2{\hat m}^3 R_{2}^{(1)} R_{1}^{(2)}R_{2}^{(3)} -
{\hat m}^1{\hat m}^2n^3 R_{2}^{(1)} R_{2}^{(2)}R_{1}^{(3)}) , \label{3vp}
\end{eqnarray}
where for the specific model ${\hat m}^i=m^i$ ($i=1,2$),
${\hat m}^3={\tilde m}^3= m^3-\textstyle{1\over 2} n^3$.
(It can be verified explicitly for  each set of  $(n^i, {\hat m}^i)$ in the model
 that eqs. (\ref{v3}) and (\ref{3vp}) are indeed equivalent.)


 Due to supersymmetry $g_{YM}^{-2}\equiv Re(f)$,
where the gauge kinetic function $f$ is a holomorphic function of the moduli $S$ and $U^i$.
Given the  above definition of the real part of the
 dilaton $S$ and the $U^i$ moduli and the form
of $g_{YM}^{-2}$ (\ref{ymc}), with the $V_3$
derived in (\ref{3vp}) one obtains:
\begin{equation}
f =  {\bf \textstyle{1\over 4}} \left[ n^1n^2n^3 S -
n^1{\hat m}^2{\hat m}^3 U^1 -
{\hat m}^1n^2{\hat m^3} U^2 -
{\hat m}^1{\hat m}^2n^3 U^3 \right] \, .
\end{equation}
It is indeed a holomorphic (and linear) function of the
 fields, as required by supersymmetry.

For the specific case of the additional  (quasi-hidden)gauge sector,
\begin{equation}
f_{USp(4)} = \textstyle{1\over 4}U^2= \textstyle{1\over 12} U,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f_{USp(2)_B} =  \textstyle{1\over 4}U^1= \textstyle{1\over 4} U,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f_{USp(2)_A} =  \textstyle{1\over 2}S,
\end{equation}
where the second equality in the above equations follows from (\ref{susyratio}),
%condition $\chi_1 : \chi_2 : \chi_3 = 1:3:2$ ($\chi_i \equiv  R_2^{i} / R_{1}^{i}$)
which  implies:
\begin{equation}
U^1 : U^2 : U^3 = 1: \frac{1}{3} : \frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}
 and $U\equiv U^1$.

For the sake of completeness we also quote the gauge  kinetic
functions  for the Standard Model sector:
\begin{equation}
f_{[U(3)_C,U(1)_{1}]}= \textstyle{1\over 4}(S+\textstyle{1\over 2} U^2)= \textstyle{1\over 4}(S+\textstyle{1\over 6} U)\, ,
\label{sm1}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f_{U(2)_L}= \textstyle{1\over 4}(S+ \textstyle{3\over 2}U^1)=\textstyle{1\over 4}(S+ \textstyle{3\over 2}U)\,  ,
\label{sm2}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f_{[U(1)_8,U(1)_{8'}]}= \textstyle{1\over 2} U^3=\textstyle{1\over 4} U\, .
\label{sm3}\end{equation}
From (\ref{sm1}), (\ref{sm3}), and (\ref{hypercharge}),
one finds
\begin{equation}
f_{Y}= \textstyle{5\over {72}}(S+ \textstyle{{59}\over {30}}U)
\label{sm4}\end{equation}
for weak hypercharge.



The {\it K\""ahler potential} for the  fields  is the
so called no-scale potential. It takes the following canonical form:
\begin{equation}
K = -\log(S + \bar{S}) - \sum_{I=1}^3 \log(U^{I} +
\bar{U}^{I})= -\log(S+\bar{S}) - 3 \log(U + \bar{U}) + \log(6)\, .
\label{kahl}\end{equation}
In (\ref{kahl}) and elsewhere we have set the Planck scale $M_P^{(4d)}$ to unity,
i.e., all dimensional quantities are scaled by appropriate powers of $M_P^{(4d)}$.


\section{Gaugino Condensate and Effective Moduli Potential}

In local supersymmetric theory  the gaugino condensate $\langle \lambda^{\alpha}\lambda_{\alpha}\rangle$
 is contained in the definition of a chiral  superfield:
\begin{equation}
{\cal U} \equiv {\cal W}^\alpha {\cal W}_{\alpha},
\end{equation}
where ${\cal W}_{\alpha}$ is the vector superfield whose fermionic component is $ \lambda^{\alpha}$.
The confinement scale $\mu$ of the strongly coupled theory is defined as the scale
at which the effective gauge coupling becomes strong and perturbation
theory breaks down. Consequently,  the gaugino condensate
$|\langle \lambda^{\alpha}\lambda_{\alpha}\rangle|\propto \mu^3$. This can be generated
by an exact effective superpotential for the chiral field ${\cal U}$~\cite{VY},
\begin{equation}
W({\cal U}, \Phi) = \frac{1}{4}{\cal U}f_W(\Phi) - \frac{ {\cal U}}{32 \pi^2}
(\beta \log\frac{{\cal U}}{\Lambda^3} + const),
\end{equation}
where $\Phi$ is  the modulus field in the theory which determines the strength
of the gauge coupling constants through the  gauge kinetic functions $f_W$;
$\beta$ is the $\beta$-function coefficient of the strongly coupled group, and
$\Lambda$ is the cut off scale of the theory.

The effective potential generates a VEV for ${\cal U}$,
\begin{equation}
{\cal U} = \Lambda^3 \exp ( \frac{8\pi^2}{\beta} f_W(\Phi)) \times const.
\end{equation}
Integrating out the field ${\cal U}$, an effective potential of the moduli
fields can be generated,
\begin{equation}
W_{eff}(\Phi) = \frac{\beta}{32 \pi^2} \frac{\Lambda^3}{e}
\exp (\frac{8\pi^2}{\beta} f_W(\Phi)) \\
\equiv d \Lambda^3 \exp (bf_W(\Phi)),
\end{equation}
where we have defined the  constants $d \equiv  \frac{\beta}{32e \pi^2}$ and
$b\equiv \frac{8\pi^2}{\beta}$.

The three groups $USp(4)$,
$USp(2)_A,$  and $USp(2)_B$  that  become strongly coupled have the beta function coefficients $\beta_1 = -2$,
$\beta_2 = -4$ and $\beta_3 = -6$, respectively. With the previously defined gauge kinetic
functions, the effective potential for the moduli fields $U$ and $S$ is
\begin{equation}
W (U,S) = d_1 \Lambda^3 \exp (\frac{b_1}{12}U) +  d_2 \Lambda^3 \exp (\frac{b_2}{4}U) +
d_3 \Lambda^3 \exp ( \frac{b_3}{2}S),
\end{equation}
where $d_i= \frac{\beta_i}{32e \pi^2}$ and $b_i =\frac{8\pi^2}{\beta_i}$.
This is of course only the leading instanton contribution to the
non-perturbative superpotential. It can be
justified post-factum if the negative exponents are large  at the
minimum of the potential. This indeed turns out to be
the case for the specific solution  discussed in the next Subsection.

\subsection{Scalar Potential and its Ground States}

Given the K\""ahler potential and the effective superpotential of the moduli
fields $U$ and $S$, one can derive the scalar potential for the moduli
fields,
\begin{equation}
V= \frac{1}{(S + \bar{S}) (U+\bar{U})^3} \left\{ |(S+\bar{S})
\frac{\partial W}{\partial S} -W|^2 + 3|(\frac{U+\bar{U})}{3}
\frac{\partial W}{\partial U} -W|^2  -3 |W|^2 \right\}\, . \label{pot}
\end{equation}
In the above potential we have absorbed   the coefficient $\sqrt{6}$
from the
$\log {6} $ term in the K\""ahler potential (\ref{kahl})
in  the
definition of $\Lambda^3\to \sqrt{6}\Lambda^3$.


It is expected that the  gauge coupling threshold corrections
would introduce  corrections that depend on toroidal   K\""ahler moduli
$T_i$ (see \cite{LS}) of the form that would modify the superpotential in
a multiplicative way, i.e.,
$W_{total}=W_0(T_i)W(S,U)$, where  $W_0$ typically depends on
a product of  Dedekind modular functions $\eta(T_i)$, i.e.,
$W_0\sim \prod_{i=1}^3 \eta(T_i)^{-2}$. A superpotential contribution of
that type, along with the
K\""ahler potential $K=-\prod_{i=1}^3 \log(T_i+{\bar T}_i)$, could in turn
also contribute to supersymmetry breaking    and   stabilization of
K\""ahler moduli.
In this paper we are not including these effects, i.e.,
we assume that the
dominant effects associated with the supersymmetry breaking come
from the tree level  gauge coupling contribution and are thus
associated with the $S$ and $U$ sector contributions. We hope to return to
the threshold correction contributions to the effective superpotential in
the future.



 It is difficult to derive an analytical expressions for the minimum of the potential, so
we proceed with a numerical analysis.

The potential is periodic in $Im(U)$ and $Im(S)$, with periods $12N/\pi$ and
 $3M/\pi$, respectively, where $M$ and $N$ are integers.  Thus, one can focus on finding the
value of  $Im(U)$ and $Im(S)$ in the  ``fundamental domain'' $\{0,12/\pi\}$ and $\{0,3/\pi\}$,
respectively.
The  numerical minimization
%command in Maple takes too much time, even when on
%restricts the range of S and U, I was able to ``experimentally'' locate
yields the minimum at: \begin{equation} Re(S)=1.10, \ \ Re(U)=0.575,\ \
Im(S)=0.48+3M/\pi, \ \ Im(U)=1.91+12N/\pi \end{equation}
%[Note this is not too different from Jing's result, in spite of 1/3 factor
%mistake; she found a minimum for  specific integers N=0, M=4.]
Fig. 1 depicts the potential  near the
minimum as a
function of  moduli $S$  and $U$.


The value of the potential is negative at the minimum and is approximately
$  -3.56\ 10^{-3}\, \ L^2$, where $L\equiv \sqrt{6}\Lambda^3/(32\pi^2e)$. In the
potential (\ref{pot})  we have set the Planck scale  to 1.
The string scale is  typically chosen to be of the same
order as the Planck scale and thus
 $\Lambda ={\cal O}(1)$ (in Planck units). In our specific case
  (see the following subsection) $M_s\sim 1.85 M_P^{(4d)}$
 and thus $\Lambda^3\sim  6.33 [M_P^{(4d)}]^3 $. As a consequence $L\sim 1.81 \
 10^{-2}  [M_P^{(4d)}]^2$, and  the cosmological constant
 $\sim -1.16\times 10^{-6} [M_{P}^{(4d)}]^4$.
Since all the other
parameters of the potential  at the minima are fixed, the large
negative cosmological constant  is inevitable.

The terms  that dynamically break
supersymmetry are significantly smaller than the contribution
from  the $-3|W|^2$ term. In particular:
\begin{equation} F_S K^{S {\bar S}}\bar F_{\bar{S}}= ( |(S+{\bar S})
\partial W / \partial S - W|^2/[(S+{\bar S})(U+{\bar U})^3]\sim 4.95\  10 ^{-7}
L^2\ , \end{equation}
\begin{equation} F_U K^{U{\bar U}}\bar F_{\bar{U}}=
 3|{{(U+{\bar U})}\over 3}
\partial W / \partial U - W|^2/[(S+{\bar S})(U+{\bar U})^3]\sim 1.03\ 10 ^{-7}
L^2\ , \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 -3|W|^2 /[(S+{\bar S})(U+{\bar U})]^3\sim -3.56 \ 10^{-3} L^2\label{w3}\ .\end{equation}
Here $F_\phi\equiv e^{K\over 2} (\partial_\phi W+ K_\phi W)$
and $K_\phi \equiv \partial_\phi K$.

In the case in which one does not include the matter
contribution that is associated with the open string sector of the
$USp(4)$ brane, its  beta function  changes from $-$2 to  $-$5. In the
latter case we  found  unstable points where $V\to -\infty$  as $Re(U)\to
0$.
One such  point corresponds to
$Im(U)=4.242,\ Re(S)=0.606,\ Im(S)=0.388$
This phenomenon  is due to  the fact that in this case the
negative contribution of the potential (arising from $-3|W|^2$
term) turns out to be dominant for small values of $Re(U)$.
We do not encounter this instability in the case $\beta=-2$, for which
the relative strengths of the exponents in the effective
superpotential balance in a way that the negative contributions to
the potential do not dominate for small values of $Re(U)$ and/or
$Re(S)$.

\subsection{Phenomenology}


We first  comment on features of the gauge couplings.
The quantities $\chi$ and $1/\alpha_G$ defined in (\ref{rge1}) and
(\ref{rge2}) are related to the moduli by
\begin{equation}
\chi  =  \sqrt{\frac{Re (U)}{6 Re (S)}},  \ \ \ \
\frac{1}{\alpha_G}  =  \pi Re (S)\, . \end{equation}
At the minimum of the potential they take the values
$\chi = 0.295$ and $1/\alpha_G = 3.46$, corresponding to
$ M_P^{(4d)}/M_s = 0.542$, which satisfies the
perturbative consistency condition $ M_P^{(4d)}/M_s > 1/\sqrt 8 \pi$~\cite{CLS1}.
From these values, and the expressions for
the MSSM gauge parameters $c_a$ and $\beta_a$ given in Table VI
of~\cite{CLS1}, we can calculate the predicted values of the
standard model gauge couplings at the electroweak scale\footnote{A fully
realistic construction would predict the electroweak scale from the
soft supersymmetry breaking. In our case, we simply use the
experimental electroweak scale, which corresponds to $t=6.06$ in (\ref{rge3}).}.
The inverse strong and electromagnetic
couplings are predicted to be
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\alpha_3} = 52.2, \ \ \ \
\frac{1}{\alpha} = 525\, , \end{equation}
which are much larger than the respective  experimental values $\sim 8.5$ and
128.  The  unrealistically small values predicted for the gauge couplings
are due to the extra chiral matter in the construction\footnote{Unlike in~\cite{CLS1},
we are also including the chiral states that are not localized at the
brane intersections for consistency with our treatment of the strongly coupled
confining sector. With these states, the strong $SU(3) $ group
is not asymptotically free.}.
The weak angle $\sin^2 \theta_W$, which is a ratio of gauge couplings,
fares somewhat better: it is predicted to be 0.29, not
too far from the experimental 0.23.




Unfortunately, since the  minima have negative cosmological
constants, these vacua do not provide  realistic backgrounds for
a  detailed study of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters
of the charged matter sector of the model.
We defer this investigation for the future.

We can however determine gaugino masses in terms of the $F_S$ and $F_U$.
The general expression for the gaugino mass  (i.e., terms  of the type
$\lambda_a\lambda_a$  in the Lagrangian), is
\begin{equation}
m_{\lambda_a}=(\partial_{\phi_i}\,f_a)K^{\phi_i \, {\bar\phi_j}}
{\bar F_{\bar \phi_j}}\, .
\end{equation}
Here $K^{\phi_i \, {\bar\phi_j}}$ is the inverse of the K\""ahler metric,
$f_a$ is a gauge kinetic function,
and $F_\phi$ was defined after Eq. (\ref{w3}) .
 In the Standard Model sector the  gauge functions, determined
  in (\ref{sm1}-\ref{sm3}),
yield  the following  expressions for
 gaugino masses at the string scale:
\begin{eqnarray}
m_{[U(3)_C,U(1)_{1}]}&=&\textstyle{1\over 4}K^{S\, {\bar S}}{\bar F_{\bar S}}
+ \textstyle{1\over {24}}K^{U\,
{\bar U}}{\bar F_{\bar U}}\\ \nonumber
&=&  (1.89-3.48\, I)\, 10^{-4}\, L\sim (3.42-6.30\, I)\, 10^{-6}
M_P^{(4d)}\,,
%&=&  (1.89-3.48\, I)\, 10^{-4}\, \sqrt{L}
%\sim (2.54-4.68\, I)\, 10^{-5} M_P^{(4d)}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}
m_{U(2)_L}=\textstyle{1\over 4}K^{S\, {\bar S}}{\bar F_{\bar S}}+
 \textstyle{3\over {8}}K^{U\,
{\bar U}}{\bar F_{\bar U}}=(2.41-3.95\, I)\, 10^{-4}
 L \sim  (4.36-7.15\, I)\, 10^{-6} M_P^{(4d)}\, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
m_{[U(1)_8,U(1)_{8'}]}=\textstyle{1\over 4}K^{U\,
{\bar U}}{\bar F_{\bar U}}= (3.93-3.56\, I)\,10^{-5} L\sim
(7.11-6.44\, I)
10^{-7} M_P^{(4d)}\, ,
\end{equation}
where we have restored the appropriate factor of $M_P^{(4d)}$ in the final expressions.
When a set of $U(1)$'s with charges $Q_a$ is broken to a single $U(1)'$
with charge $Q' = \sum_a d_a Q_a$, then the $U(1)'$ coupling and
gaugino masses are related to those of the original factors by
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\alpha'} = \sum_a \frac{d_a^2}{\alpha_a}, \ \ \ \
m' =  \frac{\sum_a \frac{d_a^2}{\alpha_a} m_a}{ \sum_a \frac{d_a^2}{\alpha_a}}\, . \end{equation}
From (\ref{hypercharge}) one then obtains\footnote{In the present case, the additional
$U(1)$ factors are not broken at a high scale. $m_Y$ therefore refers to
the diagonal $YY$ element of the gaugino mass matrix.}
\begin{equation}
m_{Y}= (1.20 -2.03\, I)\,10^{-4}\, L\sim (2.17-3.67\, I) \,
10^{-6} M_P^{(4d)}
\end{equation}


These masses are non-universal, complex (indicating significant $CP$-violating phases),
and  the values for the specific solution  are too large.
As in all such constructions, the gaugino masses below the string scale satisfy the
same RG equations at one loop as the corresponding gauge couplings, so that
$m_a(t)/m_a(0) = \alpha_a(t)/\alpha_a(0)$. However, unlike
heterotic constructions and simple grand unified theories, the gaugino
masses and gauge couplings at the string scale depend on two moduli $S$ and $U$.
These dependences are non-universal and are different for the gaugino masses and
gauge couplings. Thus the  gaugino unification prediction
$m_b(t)/m_a(t) = \alpha_b(t)/\alpha_a(t)$ of those models is lost.
Rather, one has
\begin{equation}
\frac{m_b(t)\alpha_a(t)}{m_a(t)\alpha_b(t)} = \frac{m_b(0) f_b}{m_a(0) f_a}\, .
\label{nonuniversal}\end{equation}
For example, for the minimum of the potential in this model, the
right hand side of (\ref{nonuniversal}) is $0.52-0.026 I$ for $(b,a) =
(SU(3),SU(2))$ and $10.6+ 0.16 I$ for $(b,a) =
(SU(2),\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} U(1)_Y)$,
where $\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} U(1)_Y$
corresponds to the coupling $5 \alpha_Y/3$ that unifies with $\alpha_2$ and
$\alpha_3$ in the conventional MSSM.






 \section{Conclusions}

 We  conclude with a few remarks contrasting the results obtained  with those of the
 perturbative heterotic quasi-realistic models.
 The supersymmetry breaking   in  heterotic  models has been extensively studied
 (see, e.g., \cite{Casas,Casasp} and references therein, and for recent studies \cite{Abel}.).
 One specific feature of heterotic models is that the tree level gauge couplings are universal
 and depend only on one modulus $S$. Therefore,  the gaugino
  condensation typically  generates an effective superpotential that
  involves only one field, thus making the minimization of the supergravity potential
  a more intricate process. In addition, for
  a number of quasi-realistic models, while possessing an
  additional gauge sector, such sectors  often were not confining (the beta functions were
  positive due to the additional matter).  Further exploration involved  the  string
  threshold corrections that depend on toroidal moduli  and allow for additional
  features of the  supersymmetry breaking  vacuum. In  these
  examples the cosmological constant was in general large and
  negative and would have to be fixed  by hand.


  In contrast the supersymmetric  models with intersecting D6 branes provide a framework with a
  confining gauge sector, where gaugino condensation can be addressed explicitly. We
  have demonstrated in   an explicit example that the effective non-perturbative superpotential
  allows for the minimum of the supergravity potential in which  supersymmetry is broken
  and the moduli (that determine the tree level gauge couplings at the string scale) are
  completely determined. Since the gauge couplings  typically  depend on more than one modulus,
  the minimization of the potential involves an interplay among all these moduli. The specific
  example has the property that the part of the potential that spontaneously breaks
   supersymmetry  is much smaller than the  $-3|W|^2$ term, resulting in a large  and negative
   cosmological constant. We hope that other quasi-realistic models \cite{CP}
   with intersecting
   D6 branes  may
   remedy this feature and possibly yield more realistic predictions,
   and plan to investigate dynamical
   supersymmetry breaking there.
