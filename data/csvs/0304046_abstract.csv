We develop the derivative expansion of the one-loop ${\cal N}=4$
SYM effective action depending both on ${\cal N}=2$ vector
multiplet and on hypermultiplet background fields.  Beginning with
formulation of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM theory in terms of ${\cal N}=1$
superfields, we construct the one-loop effective action with the
help of superfield functional determinants and calculate this
effective action in ${\cal N}=1$ superfield form using an
approximation of constant Abelian strength $F_{mn}$ and
corresponding constant hypermultiplet fields. Then we show that
the terms in the supercovariant derivative expansion of the
effective action can be rewritten in terms of ${\cal N}=2$
superfields. As a result, we get a new derivation of the complete
${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric low-energy effective action obtained
in hep-th/0111062 and find subleading corrections to it. A problem
of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry of the results is discussed.  Using
the formalism of ${\cal N}=2$ harmonic superspace and exploring
on-shell hidden ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM
theory we construct the appropriate hypermultiplet-depending
contributions. The hidden ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry requirements
allow to get a leading, in hypermultiplet derivatives, part of the
correct ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric functional containing $F^{8}$
among the component fields.
