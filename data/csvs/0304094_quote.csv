Four dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity has regular,
stationary, asymptotically flat BPS solutions with intrinsic
angular momentum, describing bound states of separate extremal
black holes with mutually nonlocal charges. Though the existence
and some properties of these solutions were established some time
ago, fully explicit analytic solutions were lacking thus far. In
this note, we fill this gap. We show in general that explicit
solutions can be constructed whenever an explicit formula is known
in the theory at hand for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a
single black hole as a function of its charges, and illustrate
this with some simple examples. We also give an example of
moduli-dependent black hole entropy.
