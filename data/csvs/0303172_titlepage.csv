\begin{abstract}
\normalsize\noindent
Using S(pacelike)-branes defined through rolling tachyon
solutions, we show how the dynamical formation of
D(irichlet)-branes and strings in tachyon condensation can be
understood. Specifically we present solutions of S-brane actions
illustrating the classical confinement of electric and magnetic
flux into fundamental strings and D-branes. The role of S-branes
in string theory is further clarified and their RR charges are
discussed. In addition, by examining ``boosted'' S-branes, we
find what appears to be a surprising dual S-brane description of
strings and D-branes, which also indicates that the critical
electric field can be considered as a self-dual point in string
theory. We also introduce new tachyonic S-branes
as Euclidean counterparts to non-BPS branes.
