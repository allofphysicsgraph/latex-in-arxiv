We compute the billiards that emerge in the
Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) limit for all pure
supergravities in $D=4$ spacetime dimensions, as well as for
$D=4$, $N=4$ supergravities coupled to $k$ ($N=4$) Maxwell
supermultiplets. We find that just as for the cases $N=0$ and
$N=8$ investigated previously, these billiards can be identified
with the fundamental Weyl chambers of hyperbolic Kac-Moody
algebras. Hence, the dynamics is chaotic in the BKL limit. A new
feature arises, however, which is that the relevant Kac-Moody
algebra can be the Lorentzian extension of a {\it twisted} affine
Kac-Moody algebra, while the $N=0$ and $N=8$ cases are untwisted.
This occurs for $N=5$, where one gets $A_4^{(2)\wedge}$, and for
$N=3$ and $2$, for which one gets $A_2^{(2)\wedge}$. An
understanding of this property is provided by showing that the
data relevant for determining the billiards are the {\it
restricted root system} and the {\it maximal split subalgebra} of
the finite-dimensional real symmetry algebra characterizing the
toroidal reduction to $D=3$ spacetime dimensions. To summarise:
split symmetry controls chaos.
