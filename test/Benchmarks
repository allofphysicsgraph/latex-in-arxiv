The time comparision isn't fair in this case, but need to compare the difference in output. Why are there 270 results vs 261.

The difference in counts 
  Comments are parsed as a para in latexml. 
  LaTeXML has a wide variety of configurations available, so it is likely possible to tokenize the inline math found in comments.

  Another issue related to the counts is in the figure. Seems like the inline math found in the figure starting on line 147 is represented twice in the xml document. 

grep '<Math mode="inline".*?>' output  -oP|sort|uniq|wc -l





yields 270
