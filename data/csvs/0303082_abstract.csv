We obtain the exact non-perturbative solution of a
scalar field theory defined on a space with noncommuting position and momentum
coordinates. The model describes non-locally interacting charged
particles in a background magnetic field. It is an exactly solvable
quantum field theory which has non-trivial interactions only when it
is defined with a finite ultraviolet cutoff. We propose that
small perturbations of this theory can produce solvable models with
renormalizable interactions.
