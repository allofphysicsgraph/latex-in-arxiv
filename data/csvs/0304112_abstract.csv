We discuss an $O(N)$ exension of the Sine-Gordon (S-G)equation described by
the
Lagrangian $ {\cal L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \vec{\phi}) ^2$ + N
$\frac{\alpha_0} {\beta^2} \cos \beta \sqrt {\rho}  $,  where $\rho = \frac
{\vec{\phi} \cdot \vec{\phi}}{N} $ which allows us to  perform an expansion
around the leading order in large-N result using Path-Integral methods.  In
leading order we show our methods agree with the results of a variational
calculation at large-N. We discuss the striking differences for a
non-polynomial interaction between the form for $\langle V[\phi] \rangle$ in
the Gaussian approximation that one obtains at  large-N when compared to the
$N=1$ case.  This is in contrast to  the case when $V[\phi]$ is a
polynomial and no such drastic differences occur. We find for our large-N
extension of the Sine-Gordon model that  the unbroken ground state is
unstable
as one increases the coupling constant (as it is for the original S-G
equation) and we find in leading order that the unbroken symmetry vacuum is
stable as long as $ \beta^2 \leq 24 \pi$.
