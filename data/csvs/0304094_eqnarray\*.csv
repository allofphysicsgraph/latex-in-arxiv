 \\
 &=& (\bar{Z}_Q Z_A + Z_Q \bar{Z}_A)|_{z_*(Q)} + 0 + 0 \\
 &=& 2 \, {\rm Re }(\bar{C}_* Z_A|_{z_*(Q)}).
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore we find that a solution to (\ref{geneq}) for a given $Q$
satisfies
\begin{equation} \label{Zsol}
 2 \bar{C} Z_A = \partial_A \Sigma - i\,I_{AB} Q^B,
\end{equation}
and, since $Z_A = e^{\CK/2} X_A$:
\begin{equation} \label{modsol}
 t_A \equiv \frac{X_A}{X_0} =
 \frac{\partial_A \Sigma - i\, I_{AB} Q^B}{\partial_0 \Sigma - i\, I_{0B}
 Q^B},
\end{equation}
where the $0$-index refers to some suitably chosen basis element.
Locally, $n_v$ of the $t_A$ can be used as holomorphic coordinates
on $\widetilde{\CM}$. They are the usual ``special'' coordinates of
special geometry. Thus, (\ref{modsol}) together with (\ref{Fdef})
gives the values for $|C|$ and the moduli solving (\ref{geneq}) in
terms of a single function $\Sigma$ (which of course may still be hard
to compute). Note that $\Sigma$ is a homogeneous function of degree
two, i.e.\ $\Sigma(\lambda Q)=\lambda^2 \Sigma(Q)$, since (\ref{Zsol})
implies
\begin{equation}
 Q^A \partial_A \Sigma = 2 \bar{C} Q^A Z_A = 2 |Q^A Z_A|^2 = 2 \Sigma.
\end{equation}

Now we apply all this to solve the BPS field equation (\ref{mc1}),
which is of the form (\ref{geneq}) with $Q=H(\sx)$ and
$C=e^{-U(\sx)} e^{i \alpha(\sx)}$, so
\begin{equation} \label{mc1sol}
 e^{-2 U} = \Sigma(H) \quad \mbox{ and } \quad
 t_A \equiv \frac{X_A}{X_0} =
 \frac{\partial_A \Sigma(H) - i\, I_{AB} H^B}{\partial_0 \Sigma(H)- i\, I_{0B}
 H^B}.
\end{equation}
If $\Sigma$ is multi-valued, the relevant branch is selected by
continuity and the fact that the solution is unambiguous at
infinity (since it is given by the boundary conditions).
An obvious necessary
condition for existence of the solution is furthermore that $H$ stays within the
domain of $\Sigma$ everywhere.

To connect $\Sigma$ to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, consider the
case of a single charge $\Gamma$ at the origin, i.e. $H = \Gamma/r
- C$. Then we find for the horizon area of the BPS black hole thus
produced, from (\ref{mc1sol}) and the degree two homogeneity
property of $\Sigma$:
\begin{equation}
 A = 4 \pi \lim_{r \to 0} r^2 e^{-2U} = 4 \pi \lim_{r \to 0} r^2
 \Sigma(\Gamma/r-C) = 4 \pi \Sigma(\Gamma),
\end{equation}
and therefore for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy function $S_{BH}$
\begin{equation}
 S_{BH}(\Gamma) = \pi \Sigma(\Gamma).
\end{equation}
So we see that if $S_{BH}$ is explicitly known, the full solution
(for $U$ and the moduli in special coordinates) can be constructed
explicitly as well. As a side remark, note that homogeneity of $\Sigma$
and (\ref{mc1sol}) similarly imply that the moduli at the horizon
$r=0$ are fixed to the value obtained by replacing $H \to \Gamma$
in the expression for $t_A$, and in particular are independent of
the moduli at infinity (apart for possible $\Sigma$-branch selection).
This is the well-known attractor mechanism of $\CN=2$ BPS black
holes \cite{FKS}.

Computing $S_{BH}$ in $\CN=2$ supergravity theories analytically
can be quite involved, and has only been done in limits where the
periods become polynomial in the special coordinates (e.g.\ large
complex structure (radius) limits in compactification of IIB (IIA)
on a Calabi-Yau) \cite{shmakova,M}. This usually proceeds through
solving an equation of the form (\ref{geneq}) (with $Q=\Gamma$),
and along the way one derives the corresponding expressions for
the $t_A$ as well. In practice it is often more convenient to
directly use those formulas rather than computing the $t_A$ from
$\Sigma$ using (\ref{mc1sol}). The only point of this section is then
the prescription that the full solution is obtained from the
horizon computations essentially by substituting the harmonic
function $H$ for the charge $\Gamma$.

Alternatively, in some cases, one can compute the entropy function
microscopically \cite{SV,vafaCYBH,MSW}. Then this section gives a
recipe to construct the full supergravity solution just from this
piece of microscopic information. In fact, using (\ref{modsol}),
one can in principle reconstruct the full special geometry from
knowledge of the entropy function alone.

\subsection{Solutions for $U$ and $z$: diagonal $T^6$ example}

In the case of the diagonal $T^6$ example of section
\ref{sec:diagT6}, the function $\Sigma$ is given by $\Sigma(Q)=\sqrt{D(Q)}$,
with $D(Q)$ the discriminant function \cite{M}:
\begin{equation} \label{T6dis}
 D = 3 p^2 q^2 + 4 p^3 u + 4 q^3 v + 6 u q p v - u^2 v^2
\end{equation}
where we have denoted the components of $Q$ with respect to the
$(D0,D2,D4,D6)$-basis as $(u,q,p,v)$, so $Q^A X_A = u + 3 q \tau -
3 p \tau^2 - v \tau^3$. For the corresponding modulus $\tau=b+a \,
i$ we get (using (\ref{modsol}) or directly from \cite{M}):
\begin{equation} \label{T6mod}
 \tau = b + a \, i = \frac{pq-uv + i \sqrt{D}}{2(p^2+q v)}.
\end{equation}
For charges $\Gamma_s = (\hat{u}_s,\hat{q}_s,\hat{p}_s,\hat{v}_s)$
at positions $\sx_s$, the harmonic function $H$ of (\ref{Haha})
is, with $r_s \equiv |\sx-\sx_s|$:
\begin{eqnarray}
 H(\sx) &=& \biggl(u(\sx),q(\sx),p(\sx),v(\sx)\biggr) \label{HT6a} \\
 &=&
 \biggl( \mbox{$\sum_s$} \frac{\hat{u}_s}{r_s} - c_0,
 \mbox{$\sum_s$} \frac{\hat{q}_s}{r_s} - c_2,
 \mbox{$\sum_s$} \frac{\hat{p}_s}{r_s} - c_4,
 \mbox{$\sum_s$} \frac{\hat{v}_s}{r_s} - c_6 \biggr), \label{HT6b}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{equation}
 (c_0,c_2,c_4,c_6) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{8a^3}}
 {\rm Im } [e^{-i\alpha}(\tau^3,-\tau^2,-\tau,1)] \,\,\biggr|_{r=\infty}
\end{equation}
and $\alpha = \arg(\hat{u}+3 \hat{q} \tau -3 \hat{p} \tau^2 -
\hat{v} \tau^3 )$ with $(\hat{u},\hat{q},\hat{p},\hat{v}) = \sum_s
(\hat{u}_s,\hat{q}_s,\hat{p}_s,\hat{v}_s)$. The metric factor
$e^{-2U}$ of the solution is then obtained as $e^{-2U(\sx)} =
\sqrt{D(\sx)}$ with the $\sx$-dependent $(u,q,p,v)$ from
(\ref{HT6b}) plugged into (\ref{T6dis}), and the modulus field
$\tau(\sx)$ similarly from (\ref{T6mod}).

Note that for the solution to exist, we need $D \geq 0$
everywhere. In particular this requires $D(\Gamma_s) \geq 0$ for
all charges $\Gamma_s$. Recall furthermore that the constraint
(\ref{distconstr}) has to be satisfied.

A simple spherically symmetric example is provided by considering
a charge $(\hat{u},0,\hat{p},0)$, $\hat{u},\hat{p}>0$, with
$\tau_\infty = i a_\infty$. Then we get $e^{-2U}=\sqrt{D}=2
\sqrt{p^3u}$, $\tau=i \sqrt{u/p}$, with
$u=\hat{u}/r+\sqrt{a_\infty^3/2}$, $p=\hat{p}/r+1/\sqrt{2
a_\infty}$, reproducing the usual D0-D4 BPS black hole solution
with zero $B$-field.

\begin{figure}
  \epsfig{file=tauplot.eps,height=8cm,angle=0,trim=0 0 0 0}
  \caption{\emph{Left:} Profile of $\tau(\sx)$ in the upper half plane

  The red curve is the line of marginal stability. \emph{Right:} $e^U$ as a
  function of $x$ with the two charges located on the $x$-axis.}
  \label{tauplot}
\end{figure}

As a specific example of a two-centered solution, consider the
charges $\Gamma_1=(4,0,1,0)$ and $\Gamma_2=(0,4,0,1)$. Notice that
$D(\Gamma_1)=D(\Gamma_2)=16$ while $D(\Gamma_1+\Gamma_2)=-125$, so
a two-centered solution can indeed exist whereas a single centered
one cannot. From (\ref{eqsep}), we find for the separation of the
charges
\begin{equation}
 |\sx_1-\sx_2| = -19 \sqrt{2 a} |X| \, / \,
 (12a^4+12b^4+24a^2b^2+25a^2-39b^2+12) \biggr|_{r=\infty}
\end{equation}
with $X=X_1+X_2 = 4+12\tau-3\tau^2-\tau^3$. Therefore a necessary
condition for existence of the solution is
\begin{equation} \label{stabcond}
 12a^4+12b^4+24a^2b^2+25a^2-39b^2+12 < 0.
\end{equation}
The zero locus of the left hand side consists of two branches, one
with $b>0$ (shown in fig.\ \ref{tauplot}) and the other with
$b<0$. On the $b<0$ branch, we have $\arg Z_1 = \arg Z_2 + \pi$,
and on the $b>0$ branch, we have $\arg Z_1 = \arg Z_2$. As
discussed at the end of section \ref{sec:bpseom}, on general
grounds, only the latter branch can be a boundary between a region
where the BPS state exists and a region where it does not.
Therefore, the only region in which the BPS bound state can exist
is the region inside the branch with $b>0$.\footnote{When one
tries to construct a solution with $\tau$ at $r=\infty$ inside the
other branch, one finds that $D$ becomes negative and the solution
breaks down.}


To be completely explicit, let us pick the point $b=1$, $a=1/4$,
which lies inside the stable domain. The separation of the charges
is then $|\sx_1-\sx_2| \approx 4.29899$, and
\begin{equation}
 H \approx (\frac{4}{r_1}-5.47809,\frac{4}{r_2}+5.83671,
 \frac{1}{r_1}+5.83091,\frac{1}{r_2}-5.48245).
\end{equation}
The corresponding image of the map $\tau(\sx)$ is plotted in fig.\
\ref{tauplot}. It has the profile of a ``fattened split flow'', as
anticipated in \cite{branessugra,montreal}, with starting point
$\tau_\infty = 1+i/4$ and its two legs at $r_1=0$ and $r_2=0$
ending on the attractor points of respectively $\Gamma_1$ and
$\Gamma_2$, i.e.\ $\tau=2 i$ and $\tau=i/2$.

\subsection{Solutions for $\omega$}

We now turn to the solution of (\ref{mc2}). First we consider the
case of two centers, which generalizes straightforwardly to the
case of an arbitrary number of centers thanks to the linearity of
(\ref{mc2}). Let the position of the centers be $\sx_1=(0,0,-l)$
and $\sx_2=(0,0,l)$, and denote $\langle \Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 \rangle
\equiv \kappa$. Then according to the integrability condition
(\ref{eqsep}), we have $2 {\rm Im }(e^{-i \alpha} Z_1)_\infty = - 2
{\rm Im }(e^{-i \alpha} Z_2)_\infty = \kappa/2l$, so (\ref{mc2}) becomes
\begin{equation} \label{omeq2}
 d \omega = \kappa \s* \biggl( r_2^{-1} d\, r_1^{-1}
 - r_2^{-1} d\, r_1^{-1} - (2 l)^{-1} d\, r_1^{-1}
 + (2 l)^{-1} d\, r_2^{-1} \biggr).
\end{equation}
Introducing spherical coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$, and using the
identities
\begin{equation}
 r_1^2 = r^2+l^2+2 r l \cos \theta, \quad
 r_2^2 = r^2+l^2-2 r l \cos \theta, \quad
 (r_1 r_2)^2 = l^4 + r^4 - 2 l^2 r^2 \cos 2\theta
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
 \s* dr = r^2 \sin \theta d\theta \wedge d\phi, \quad
 \s* d\theta = -\sin \theta dr \wedge d\phi,
\end{equation}
we get for (\ref{omeq2}):
\begin{eqnarray}
 d \omega &=& -\kappa \, l \, \frac{2 r(l^2+r^2)(1-\cos 2\theta) \, dr
 +r^2(l^2-r^2) \sin 2 \theta \, d\theta}{(l^4 + r^4 - 2l^2r^2\cos
 2\theta)^{3/2}}\wedge d\phi \nonumber \\
 &&+ \frac{\kappa}{2l} (\sin \theta_1 \, d\theta_1 - \sin \theta_2
 \, d \theta_2) \wedge d\phi  \nonumber \, ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ are the angles with the $z$-axis in a
spherical coordinate system with origin at $\sx_1$ resp.\ $\sx_2$
(related to the central spherical coordinates by $r \cos \theta -
r_1 \cos \theta_1=l=r_2 \cos \theta_2 - r \cos \theta$).
Integrating this equation gives for $\omega$ (up to $\omega \to
\omega + d f$ gauge transformations):
\begin{equation} \label{omegasol2}
 \omega = \frac{\kappa}{2 l} \biggl(
 \frac{l^2-r^2}{(l^4+r^4-2l^2r^2\cos 2\theta)^{1/2}}
 + 1 - \cos \theta_1 + \cos \theta_2
 \biggr) d\phi \, .
\end{equation}
Note that the correct cancellations of terms occur on all segments
of the $z$-axis to make this solution non-singular. If we had not
implemented the integrability constraint (\ref{eqsep}), this would
not have been the case, and we would have had a physical
singularity on the $z$-axis.

Asymptotically for $r\to\infty$, we have $\omega \approx
\frac{\kappa}{r} \sin^2\theta \, d\phi = \frac{\kappa}{r^3}(x dy-y
dx)$, which implies \cite{MTW} that the angular momentum of this
spacetime is $\sJ=(0,0,\kappa/2)$, in agreement with the general
result of \cite{branessugra}.

In the case of an arbitrary number of centers $\sx_s$, satisfying
the constraint (\ref{distconstr}), we get the following for
(\ref{mc2}):
\begin{equation}
 \s* d\omega = \sum_{s<t} \kappa_{st} \biggl(
 r_t^{-1}d\,r_s^{-1} - r_s^{-1}d\,r_t^{-1}
 - R_{st}^{-1} d\,r_s^{-1} + R_{st}^{-1} d\,r_t^{-1}
 \biggr),
\end{equation}
where $R_{st}=|\sx_s-\sx_t|$. Clearly the solution to this
equation can be written as
\begin{equation}
 \omega = \sum_{s<t} \omega_{st}
\end{equation}
with $\omega_{st}$ the two-center solution of (\ref{omegasol2})
for the centers $\sx_s$ and $\sx_t$.

\subsection{Solution for $\CF$: general case}

Using (\ref{Zsol}) with $C=e^{i\alpha}e^{-U}$, and $e^{-2U}=\Sigma(H)$,
expression (\ref{bpsmc3}) for the total electromagnetic
field $\CF=d\CA$ can be written as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{Fssol}
 \CA^A = I^{AB} \partial_B \ln \Sigma(H) \, (dt + \omega) + \CA^A_d,
\end{equation}
where, introducing spherical coordinates $(r_s,\theta_s,\phi_s)$ around each center $\sx_s$,
\begin{equation}
 \CA_d = - \sum_s \cos \theta_s \, d \phi_s \otimes \Gamma_s.
\end{equation}
For a probe particle with charge $\Gamma_p$ in this background,
the second term in (\ref{Sp}) becomes
\begin{equation}
 \frac{1}{2} \int \langle \Gamma_p,\CA \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \int \Gamma_p^A \partial_A \ln \Sigma(H) \, (dt+\omega) +
 \langle \Gamma_p,\CA_d \rangle
\end{equation}
Note also that (\ref{Sp}) and (\ref{bpsmc3}) imply that the
potential for a static probe is
\begin{equation}
 V = 2 e^U |Z_p| \sin^2[(\alpha_p-\alpha)/2]
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_p = \arg Z_p$. The probe is therefore in (BPS)
equilibrium wherever $\alpha_p=\alpha$.

\setcounter{equation}{0}\section{Dependence of entropy on moduli}

The existence of multi-centered black hole bound states implies
that entropy is not determined by charge only. If, say, a certain
charge supports a spherically symmetric black hole solution, and
in a certain region of moduli space also a multi-centered black
hole solution, the entropy associated to the charge will jump when
crossing into that region.

Here we give an explicit example of this phenomenon. Consider the
charges $Q_1 = (0,q,0,v)$, $Q_2=(u,0,0,0)$, $Q = Q_1 + Q_2$, with
$u,q,v>0$. The corresponding periods are $X_1=3 q \tau - v
\tau^3$, $X_2=u$, the discriminants are
\begin{eqnarray}
 D(Q_1) &=& 4 q^3 v \\
 D(Q_2) &=& 0 \\
 D(Q) &=& 4 q^3 v - u^2v^2,
\end{eqnarray}
and the attractor points
\begin{eqnarray}
 \tau_*(Q_1) &=& i \sqrt{\frac{q}{v}} \\
 \tau_*(Q_2) &=& 0 \\
 \tau_*(Q) &=& \frac{-uv+i\sqrt{4 q^3 v - u^2v^2}}{2qv} \, .
\end{eqnarray}
If $D(Q)>0$, a single-centered black hole solution always exists.
To find the region in the upper half plane where a two-centered
solution exists as well, we compute the $(Q_1,Q_2)$ line of
marginal stability ${\rm Im }(X_1 \bar{X}_2)=0$, ${\rm Re }(X_1 \bar{X}_2)>0$.
Writing $\tau=b+ia$:
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\rm Im }(X_1 \bar{X}_2) &=& u a (3 q - v(3b^2-a^2)) \\
 {\rm Re }(X_1 \bar{X}_2) &=& 8 u v b (b^2 - \frac{3}{4} \frac{q}{v}),
\end{eqnarray}
so the marginal stability line is the hyperbole branch
\begin{equation}
 a = \sqrt{3} \sqrt{b^2-\frac{q}{v}}, \quad b>\sqrt{\frac{q}{v}}
 \,.
\end{equation}
The condition for stability is
\begin{equation}
 \langle Q_1,Q_2 \rangle \, {\rm Im }(X_1 \bar{X}_2) > 0 \, .
\end{equation}
Because $\langle Q_1,Q_2 \rangle = - u v$, this implies that the
stable region is the region to the right of the MS line. In type
IIA language, this means we have to turn on a sufficiently large
B-field to have a stable two-centered BPS solution.\footnote{or
more generally a multicentered solution consisting of a core black
hole of charge $Q_1$ and a cloud of charge $(1,0,0,0)$ particles
(i.e.\ D0-branes) on a sphere with radius equal to the equilibrium
distance.} Note that $\sqrt{D(Q)}<\sqrt{D(Q_1)}+\sqrt{D(Q_2)}$, so
the two-centered solution with charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, if it
exists, has in fact more entropy than the single centered
solution.

The microscopic prediction which follows from this is that the
moduli space of this D-brane system will develop a new branch at a
certain critical value of the B-field (in IIA), with an
exponentially larger cohomology than the original branch.

\setcounter{equation}{0}\section{Conclusions}

We have shown how non-static multi-centered BPS solutions of
$\CN=2$ supergravity can be constructed analytically. In
particular we argued that this can be done explicitly whenever the
BPS entropy as a function of charge is known explicitly. This
allowed us to verify directly some properties of these solutions
inferred earlier in \cite{branessugra,montreal}. We also gave an
explicit example of moduli-dependent entropy.
