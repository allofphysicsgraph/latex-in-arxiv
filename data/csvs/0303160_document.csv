\noindent
We review in a pedagogical manner some of the efforts aiming to extend
the gauge/gravity correspondence to non-conformal supersymmetric gauge
theories in four dimensions. After giving a general overview, we
discuss in detail two specific examples: fractional D-branes on
orbifolds and D-branes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau
spaces. We explore in particular which gauge theory information can be
extracted from the corresponding supergravity solutions, and what the
remaining open problems are. We also briefly explain the connection
between these and other approaches, such as fractional branes on
conifolds, branes suspended between branes, M5-branes on Riemann
surfaces and M-theory  on G2-holonomy manifolds, and discuss the
r\^ole played by geometric transitions  in all that.

\section*{\centerline{Foreward}} 

These lectures are based on an eight-hour course I gave at SISSA/ISAS,
December 2002, on non-conformal extensions of the gauge/gravity
correspondence. This is a vast subject and I could not discuss in
detail all approaches that have been used to pursue such a program.
The choice was to focus on cases where supersymmetry and conformal
invariance are broken by the geometry and/or D-branes, hence looking
directly for gravity duals of non conformal theories. That  is to say,
we did not consider cases where conformal invariance is broken by mass
deformations starting from  conformal theories. In particular, we
analyzed two systems in detail: fractional D-branes on orbifolds and
D-branes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds.

This written version contains few more material than I was able to
cover during the course. Some more details are provided for both
fractional and wrapped branes (lecture II and III, respectively),
while lecture IV contains a wider (but still qualitative) presentation
of other approaches used to study the gauge/gravity correspondence in
non-conformal cases, with an emphasis on the relations between them.

Throughout the text there are few (simple) exercises that might help
in  getting a more concrete handle on the concepts and the tools
discussed. Plus, I added some inserts when some few more details were
needed on topics I could not explain in detail in the main text.%, not to
%interrupt the logic flow of the lectures.

There have been hundreds of papers on this subject in the last few
years  and it would be a daunting task to give credit to all of
them. As this  is not a review but a series of lectures notes for
students, I will not  provide a complete list of references but
instead accompany the reader  into a brief tour through some of the
literature.

Hope you enjoy the reading!

\section{Lecture I - Introduction And Overview}
%\input{intro.tex}
The goal of these lectures is to review some of the efforts that have
been made in the past few years to extend the gauge/gravity
correspondence to non-conformal and less supersymmetric settings as
compared to the original duality proposed by Maldacena, which relates
type IIB string theory on ${\rm AdS}_5\times S^5$ to four-dimensional
${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM), this being a conformal and
maximally supersymmetric gauge theory. This goal has been pursued in
many different ways in the recent literature, so let me first explain
what my specific point of view will be.

The celebrated AdS/CFT correspondence is a conjectured equivalence
between two apparently very different theories

\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
{ Type IIB string theory} && { ${\cal N}=4$ SYM in 4D with}\\  { on
${\rm AdS}^5\times {\rm S}^5$} && {gauge group $SU(N)$}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
As it stated above, this correspondence does not include any kind of
D-branes. In fact its seeds reside in the {\it double} nature of
D-branes, this being related to the old open/closed string duality. In
particular we know that
\begin{itemize}
\item{D-branes are hypersurfaces on which open strings can end. Their
dynamics  is described in general by a (supersymmetric) gauge theory
at low energy, this being the low energy spectrum of the corresponding
open strings.}
\item{D-branes are non-perturbative states of the closed string
spectrum (their tension going as $1/g_s$ where $g_s$ is the string
coupling) and at low energy they are described by soliton-like
solutions of the corresponding supergravity theory.}
\end{itemize}
This suggests to try and exploit the classical geometrical properties
of D-branes to study the gauge theory living on them or use the
quantum properties of the gauge theory to study the dynamics of
non-perturbative extended objects. This idea applies to any kind of
D-brane and was considered well before the work of Maldacena
(essentially it is part of the discovery by Polchinski of D-branes
being non-perturbative states of the closed string spectrum). In the
case considered by Maldacena, namely a stack of $N$ D3-branes in flat
ten-dimensional space, however, it was possible to carry this
correspondence further by taking the so-called near-horizon limit
%\begin{equation}
%\alpha' \rightarrow 0 \qquad {\rm with} \qquad
%\frac{r}{\alpha'}\,,\,g_s\,,\, N \quad {\rm held\;fixed}
%\end{equation}
and observing that in this limit the bulk (closed) and gauge (open)
degrees of freedom decouple. This decoupling is at the core of the
AdS/CFT duality.

An obvious thing one can try is to see whether a similar approach can
be used to study non-conformal and less supersymmetric theories, as
for instance ${\cal N}=1,2$ SYM (and eventually ${\cal N}=0$) in four
dimensions, starting from bound states of D-branes in less
supersymmetric backgrounds, breaking eventually conformal
invariance. There is a number of problems that one usually encounters
in pursuing this program. Let me briefly anticipate some of them.
\begin{itemize}
\item{The dual supergravity solution of a non-conformal gauge theory
does not display an AdS-like geometry. This means that, strictly
speaking, holography is not at work in these cases, in general. What
one can do, at best, is to use what one learned in the conformal case
as a guiding principle but one cannot safely rely on all theorems that
proved  so fruitful in the original AdS/CFT duality.}
\item{In general, the supergravity backgrounds one finds are
singular. To give a meaning to the solution one has of course to cure
the singularity and look for a singularity-free solution. At the same
time one should understand what the r\^ole of the singularity is from
the gauge theory point of view, as well as the meaning of its
resolution. Hence, more than being a problem, this can be a source of
interest after all. We will learn much more about this.}
\item{As already pointed out, a basic aspect of the original AdS/CFT
correspondence is the decoupling between open and closed degrees of
freedom, this being the starting point to state the exact duality. The
duality can be stated at different levels (see Insert 1) and in
general  relates a given regime of the ${\cal N}=4$ gauge theory to a
given regime  of type IIB string theory on ${\rm AdS}_5 \times
S^5$. In particular, there  exists a limit in the parameter space
(i.e. the large 't-Hooft coupling limit, $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$)
where the gauge theory is supposed just to be dual to supergravity,
without any addition of string states (this is actually the regime
where the  duality as been mostly checked). In non-conformal cases it
turns out this is not the case. Roughly speaking, if one insists in
retaining just supergravity modes, the dual gauge theory cannot be
completely decoupled from the bulk. The way this manifests is very
much case-dependent, in particular there is a qualitative difference
between the ${\cal N}=2$ and the ${\cal N}=1$ cases, as we shall see
in detail during these lectures. But it is a fact that within the
supergravity regime (which is the one we will mainly investigate) a
complete decoupling does not hold.}
\end{itemize}
