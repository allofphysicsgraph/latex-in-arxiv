\item
All suffix-information is expressed.
\item
Suffixes are suppressed as much as possible. 
Instead we use the ""geometrical"" notation:\ lines, arrows, $\cdots$.
\footnote
{In this sense, the use of ``forms'' instead of the
tensorial quantities is the similar line of
simplification.
}
Particularly, 
contracted suffixes (we call them ``dummy'' suffixes) are
expressed by vertices (for fermion suffixes) or lines.
\item
The chiral flow is manifest.
\item
The graphical indices specify a spinorial quantity.
