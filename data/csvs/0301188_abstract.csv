The interaction energy and force between widely separated 
strings is analyzed in a field theory having applications to superconducting
cosmic strings, the SO(5) model of high-temperature superconductivity,
and solitons in nonlinear optics. The field theory has two order
parameters, one of which is broken in the vacuum (giving rise to
strings), the other of which is unbroken in the vacuum but which could
nonetheless be broken in the core of the string. If this does occur,
there is an effect on the energetics of widely separated strings. This
effect is important if the length scale of this second order parameter
is longer than that of the other fields in the problem.
