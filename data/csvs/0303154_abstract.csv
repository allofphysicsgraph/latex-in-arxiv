We present a class of scalar field cosmologies with a dynamically 
evolving Newton parameter $G$ and cosmological term $\Lambda$.
In particular, we discuss a class of solutions which are consistent 
with a renormalization group scaling
for $G$ and $\Lambda$  near a fixed point.
Moreover, we propose a modified action for gravity which includes the 
effective running of $G$ and $\Lambda$ near the fixed point.
