We analyze the nonrelativistic quantum scattering problem of a charged particle by an Abelian magnetic monopole in the background of a global monopole. In addition to the magnetic and geometric effects, we consider the influence of the electrostatic self-interaction on the charged particle. Moreover, for the specific case where the electrostatic self-interaction becomes attractive, charged particle-monopole bound system 
can be formed and the respective energy spectrum is hydrogen-like one.
