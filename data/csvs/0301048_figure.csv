{\caption{ \small D-brane sources of the $Z_r$-twisted fields  $\Psi$,
(\ref{tadpole0}), and $U$, (\ref{vector}), in a $Z_N$-symmetric
distribution along a circle of radius $v$ in the $X^3$-$X^8$ plane, at
$X^9=0$.
The Coulomb branch direction $X^9$ is perpendicular to the drawing.
  The branes are labeled by
values of $k$, as defined in (\ref{sources}).}}

\caption{ \small The location of a probe brane (at  general $\phi$),
shown here by an open circle, in relation to the arc of source branes
in the neighborhood of $X^8=v,~X^3=X^9=0$.  According to
(\ref{coordinates}), $\rho$ measures the radial
displacement of the probe brane from this arc (of
radius $v$), while $\phi$ gives the angular displacement
from the $X^8$ axis.  The $X^9$ displacement $\eta$
of the probe brane is not shown; the
figure should be thought of
as a projection onto the $X^9=0$ plane. The vertical line passing
through $X_8 = v$ is the R-symmetry axis of section 3.4.}
