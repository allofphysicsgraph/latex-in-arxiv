We show that the least energy conditions in the gauged nonlinear
sigma model with Chern-Simons term lead to exact soliton-like
solutions which have the same features as domain walls. We will
derive and discuss the corresponding solutions, and compute the
total energy, charge, and spin of the resulting system.
