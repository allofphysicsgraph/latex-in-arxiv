Non-commutative (quantum) mechanics, where the position
coordinates satisfy
\begin{equation}
	\big\{X_{1}, X_{2}\big\}=\theta,
\label{NCpos}
\end{equation}
has been at the center of recent interest \cite{NCQM}.
In the plane and in the non-relativistic context,
such theories are closely related to the
``exotic'' Galilean symmetry associated with the
two-fold central extension of the planar Galilei
group \cite{exotic}.
A model which provides a physical realization
of this symmetry has been presented by Lukierski,
Stichel and Zakrzewski \cite{LSZ} who considered
the acceleration-dependent Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
     L=
     \frac{m\dot{{\vec x}}^2}{2}
     +
     \frac{\kappa}{2}\,\dot{{\vec x}}\times\ddot{{\vec x}}.
     \label{LSZlag}
\end{equation}

My aim here is to point out that the
model of Lukierski et al. can actually be derived
from that published by Mathisson in `37
\cite{Mathisson}, and further discussed by Weyssenhoff
and Raabe \cite{WeyRaa}.
Not surprisingly, their theory shows interesting analogies also
with Schr\""odinger's {\it Zitternde Elektron} \cite{Schr}.

This Note is dedicated
to the memory of these outstanding physicists who,
with an extreme courage, tried  to continue
their scientific activity
under those terrible years of World War II.

\setcounter{equation}{0}\ssection{The Mathisson electron}\label{Mathisson}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Two years before the outbreak of World War II,
  Mathisson \cite{Mathisson} proposed to
describe a classical electron with the relativistic equations
\begin{equation}
     \begin{array}{ll}
     m\dot{u}^\alpha+\displaystyle\frac{1}{c^2}S^{\alpha\sigma}
     \ddot{u}_{\sigma}=f^\alpha
     \\[8pt]
     \dot{S}^{\alpha\beta}-
     \displaystyle\frac{1}{c^2}S^{\alpha\sigma}
     \dot{u}_{\sigma}u^\beta
     +
     \displaystyle\frac{1}{c^2}S^{\beta\sigma}\dot{u}_{\sigma}u^\alpha
     =0
     \end{array}
     \label{RMeq}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass, $u^\alpha$ the four-velocity,
$f^\alpha$ the force; the dot means differentiation w.r.t. proper time.
The antisymmetric tensor $S^{\alpha\beta}$ represents the
spin of the electron and is assumed to
satisfy the orthogonality condition
\begin{equation}
     S^{\alpha\beta}u_{\beta}=0.
     \label{spinconstr}
\end{equation}
In the rest frame, the spatial components of $S^{\alpha\beta}$
form therefore a three-vector $\vS$.

In the non-relativistic limit,
$\vS$ becomes a constant of the motion. In the absence of external force,
the motion is [apart of free motion along the direction of $\vS$],
in the plane perpendicular to $\vS$ and satisfies the third-order equation
\begin{equation}
     m\ddot{x}_{i}=-\kappa\epsilon_{ij}\dddot{x_{j}},
     \label{Mateq}
\end{equation}
where the new constant $\kappa$ has been defined by the
Jackiw-Nair Ansatz \cite{JaNa}
\begin{equation}
     s=\kappa c^2,
     \label{JNAnsatz}
\end{equation}
$s=\vert\vS\vert$ being the length of the spin vector.
Eqn. (\ref{Mateq}) is precisely the equation of motion
put forward by of Lukierski et al. \cite{LSZ}.

 From now on we drop the coordinate parallel to
$\vS$ and focus our attention to motion in the plane.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\setcounter{equation}{0}\ssection{Conserved Quantities}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The equations of motion (\ref{Mateq}) are associated with
the Lagrangian (\ref{LSZlag}).
Then Lukierski et al. derive the conserved quantities
associated to the space-time symmetries
applying the higher-order version of Noether's theorem.
Let us now reproduce their results using elementary methods.

$\bullet$
An obvious first integral of (\ref{Mateq}) is the momentum,
\begin{equation}
     P_{i}=m\dot{x}_{i}+\kappa\epsilon_{ij}\ddot{x}_{j}.
     \label{momentum}
\end{equation}
Eq. (\ref{Mateq}) is in fact $\dot{P}_{i}=0$.

$\bullet$ Multiplying (\ref{Mateq}) by the velocity,
$\dot{{\vec x}}$, yields a total time derivative, where we recognize the
conserved {\it energy},
\begin{equation}
     H=\frac{m\dot{{\vec x}}\strut^2}{2}+\kappa\,\dot{{\vec x}}\times\ddot{{\vec x}}.
     \label{energy}
\end{equation}

$\bullet$ Similarly, taking the vector product of
(\ref{Mateq}) with ${\vec x}$ yields the conserved {\it angular momentum},
\begin{equation}
     J=m{\vec x}\times\dot{{\vec x}}+\frac{\kappa}{2}\dot{{\vec x}}\strut^2
     -\kappa{\vec x}\cdot\ddot{{\vec x}}.
     \label{angmom}
\end{equation}

$\bullet$ A Galilean boost ${\vec x}\to{\vec x}+\vb t$ shifts the momentum
as $\vP\to\vP+m\vb$. A rest frame where the momentum vanishes can
be found, providing us with the conserved {\it boost} vector
\begin{equation}
     K_{i}=mx_{i}-t\big(m\dot{x}_{i}+\kappa\epsilon_{ij}\ddot{x}_{j}\big)
     +\kappa\epsilon_{ij}\dot{x}_{j}.
     \label{CM}
\end{equation}

Somewhat surprisingly, one more conserved quantity can be found.

$\bullet$  the vector product of
(\ref{Mateq}) with the acceleration, $\ddot{{\vec x}}$,
yields the square of the acceleration,
\begin{equation}
     I=\frac{\kappa^3}{2m^2}\big(\ddot{{\vec x}}\big)^2,
     \label{intangmom}
\end{equation}
where a constant factor
has been included for later convenience.

$\bullet$ curiously, multiplying (\ref{Mateq}) by $\dddot{{\vec x}}$ yields
once again the same  quantity, namely
$(m/2)\big(\ddot{{\vec x}}\big)^2=(m/\kappa)^3I$.

The construction of this new quantity reminds one to that
of  angular momentum and of energy.
Its precise origin will be clarified below.

Let us observe that, owing to the conservation
of $I$, $\ddot{{\vec x}}=0$ can be consistently required.
Then the conserved quantities found above
reduce to those of an ``elementary exotic particle'' studied
in \cite{DH}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\setcounter{equation}{0}\ssection{Zitterbewegung and center-of-mass
decomposition}\label{NRmotion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The equation of motion (\ref{Mateq}) is integrated at once.
Putting indeed
\begin{equation}
     Q_{i}=
     -\big(\frac{\kappa}{m}\big)^2\epsilon_{ij}\ddot{x}_{j},
     \label{intcoord}
\end{equation}
eqn. (\ref{Mateq}) becomes
\begin{equation}
     \dot{Q}_{i}=\frac{m}{\kappa}\epsilon_{ij}Q_{j},
     \label{Qeq}
\end{equation}
showing that  the
acceleration rotates uniformly with angular velocity
$m/\kappa$. Putting $Q=Q_{1}~+~iQ_{2}$, $Q(t)=Q_{0}e^{-i(m/\kappa)t}$.
This is plainly consistent with the conservation
of the magnitude of the acceleration, Eq. (\ref{intangmom}). Then
\begin{equation}
     X_{i}=x_{i}+\epsilon_{ij}Q_{j}
     \label{CMcoord}
\end{equation}
moves freely,
\begin{equation}
     \ddot{X}_{i}=0.
     \label{CMmot}
\end{equation}
In conclusion, the motion has been separated into the
free motion of the center of mass coordinate
$\vX$, combined with the ``Zitterbewegung'' [uniform rotation] of the
internal coordinate $\vQ$.

A key feature of Mathisson's electron is that
  the internal variable
$\vQ$ measures in fact the extent of how much
the momentum, $\vP$, differs from [$m$-times] the velocity, $\dot{{\vec x}}$,
\begin{equation}
     \vQ=\frac{\kappa}{m^2}(m\dot{{\vec x}}-\vP).
     \label{velmom}
\end{equation}

Re-writing the conserved quantities in terms of the new
coordinates confirms the above interpretation. In fact,
\begin{equation}
     \begin{array}{ccc}
	\vP&&=m\dot{\vX}\hfill
	\\[3pt]
	H&=H_{CM}+H_{int}\hfill&=
	\displaystyle\frac{m\dot{\vX}^2}{2}-
	\displaystyle\frac{m^3}{2\kappa^2}\vQ^2\hfill
	\\[6pt]
	J&=J_{CM}+J_{int}\hfill&=
	m\vX\times\dot{\vX}+\displaystyle\frac{\kappa}{2}\dot{\vX}^2+
	\displaystyle\frac{m^2}{2\kappa}\vQ^2\hfill
	\\[8pt]
	K_{i}&&=m(X_{i}-\dot{X}_{i}t)+\kappa\epsilon_{ij}X_{j}\hfill
	\\[6pt]
	I&&=\displaystyle\frac{m^2}{2\kappa}\vQ^2.\hfill
     \end{array}
     \label{decompCC}
\end{equation}


Mathisson's electron  is hence a composite system.
Note that in (\ref{decompCC}) the center of mass
behaves precisely as an
elementary exotic particle \cite{DH};
the internal coordinate only contributes to the energy
and the angular momentum. In fact,
$H_{int}=-\displaystyle\frac{m}{\kappa}I$
and $J_{int}=I$.
The  new conserved quantity found in (\ref{intangmom}) is hence
the internal angular momentum and also the internal energy
[which are linked in a $2$-dimensional phase space].

Let us now observe that the equations of motion (\ref{Qeq}-\ref{CMmot})
are consistent with the Poisson structure associated with the
symplectic form
\begin{equation}
     \Omega=\Omega_{CM}+\Omega_{int}=
     dP_{i}\wedge dX_{i}
     +\frac{\kappa}{2m^2}\epsilon_{ij}dP_{i}\wedge dP_{j}
     +\frac{m^2}{\kappa}\epsilon_{ij}
     dQ_{i}\wedge dQ_{j}.
     \label{sympstr}
\end{equation}
The $6$ dimensional phase space is hence the direct sum
of the four-dimensional ``exotic'' phase space
of the center of mass with coordinates $\vX$ and $\vP$,
with the two-dimensional internal phase space of the
$\vQ$, endowed with a canonical symplectic structure.

The Poisson structure can be used to calculate the
algebraic structure of the symmetries.
Consistently with Lukierski et al. \cite{LSZ},
we find that $\vP, H, J, \vK$, supplemented with the
central charges $m$ and $\kappa$,
realize the ``exotic''
[two-fold centrally extended] planar Galilei group.
The  structure relations of
this latter only differ from those of
the usual Galilei group in that
the Poisson bracket of the boost components yields the
``exotic'' central charge,
\begin{equation}
     \big\{K_{1},K_{2}\big\}=\kappa.
     \label{exoCR}
\end{equation}
Similarly, the center-of-mass coordinates have a nonvanishing
Poisson bracket,
\begin{equation}
     \big\{X_{1},X_{2}\big\}=\frac{\kappa}{m^2},
     \qquad
     \big\{Q_{1},Q_{2}\big\}=-\frac{\kappa}{m^2}.
     \label{NCCR}
\end{equation}
Both the center-of-mass and the internal coordinates are hence
noncommuting, cf. (\ref{NCpos}) with $\theta=(\kappa/m^2)$
[while the original coordinates $x_{i}$ commute].
This is similar to what happens
in the Landau problem where the guiding center coordinates are
noncommuting, with $\theta=1/eB$.

The additional conserved quantity $I$ in
(\ref{intangmom}) is actually associated with
the {\it internal symmetries}  of the system.
The translations and boosts form indeed an invariant
subgroup $K$ of the Galilei group.
The quotient $G/K$, which consists of
rotations and time translations, is hence a group that can be made to
act separately on the center-of-mass and the internal space.
We can, e. g., rotate
the internal coordinate $\vQ$ alone and leave the center-of-mass
coordinate $\vX$ fixed. This is plainly a symmetry,
and the associated conserved quantity is the
internal angular momentum $J_{int}=I$. (A physical rotation
moves both the external and internal coordinates, yielding
the total angular momentum in (\ref{decompCC})).
The internal energy arises in a similar way.
In conclusion, the non-relativistic limit of the
Mathisson electron admits the direct product
of the ``exotic'' Galilei group with the internal
rotations and time translations, $"
