copy any tex files that you want to parse latex from into this directory.
./run_all_flex_scripts.sh
several csv files will be generated with the output.

example for cite 
\cite{hartnoll1}->./sound1.tex
\cite{landau}->./sound1.tex
\cite{castep}->./sound1.tex
\cite{pbe}->./sound1.tex
\cite{fd_martin}->./sound1.tex
\cite{nondiagonal}->./sound1.tex
...

where the delimiter to split will be "->./" with an approimate 
probability of naturally occuring in latex to be around 
0.00016986  5./29555
I will come up with a better delimiter soon.
