(i)~Dynamical fields contained in the 0-forms $C$ take values in the
  cohomology group $H^0 (\sigma_-)$. In other words, dynamical fields
  in $X$-space are those satisfying $\sigma_- (C(X))= 0$. This is
  because all fields in $V/H^0 (\sigma_-)$ (i.e., such that $\sigma_-
  (C(X))\neq 0$) are auxiliary being expressed via the space-time
  derivatives ($\D$) of the dynamical fields by virtue of
  Eqs.~(\ref{geneq}). Note that $H^0 (\sigma_-)$ is always nonzero
  because it at least contains the nontrivial subspace of $V$ of
  minimal grade.


% \item
(ii)~There are as many differential conditions on the dynamical
  0-forms $C$ in Eq.~(\ref{geneq}) as elements of the cohomology group
  $H^1 (\sigma_-)$.  If grade $k$ elements of $H^1 (\sigma_-)$ impose
  equations on grade $l$ dynamical fields, an order of differential
  equations is $k+1-l$.  All other equations in (\ref{geneq}) are
  either constraints, which express auxiliary fields via derivatives
  of the dynamical ones, or consequences of the dynamical equations.
  When $H^1 (\sigma_-)$ is zero (\ref{geneq}) is equivalent to some
  (usually infinite) set of constraints which express all fields
  contained in $C(X)$ via derivatives of the dynamical fields (which
  however have no dynamics in that case being restricted by no
  differential equations).
