We discuss a new mechanism of obtaining a period of cosmological
inflation in the context of string theory. This mechanism is based
on embedded defects which form dynamically on higher dimensional
D-branes. Such defects generate topological inflation, but unlike
topological inflation from stable defects, here there is a natural
graceful exit from inflation: the decay of the embedded defect. We
demonstrate the idea in  the context of a brane-antibrane
annihilation process. The graceful exit mechanism suggested here
applies generically to all realizations of inflation on
D-branes.
