We investigate quantum corrections in non-commutative gauge theory on fuzzy
sphere. We study translation invariant models which
classically favor a single fuzzy sphere with $U(1)$ gauge group.
We evaluate the effective actions up to the two loop level.
We find non-vanishing quantum corrections at each order
even in supersymmetric models.
It is consistent with the fact that
there is no unbroken supersymmetry in de-Sitter space.
In particular the two loop contribution favors
$U(n)$ gauge group over $U(1)$ contrary to the tree action
in a deformed IIB matrix model with a Myers term.
We further observe close correspondences to 2 dimensional quantum gravity.
