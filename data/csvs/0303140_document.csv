\begin{abstract}
In M-theory vacua with vanishing 4-form $F_{(4)}$, one can invoke the
ordinary Riemannian holonomy $H \subset {\rm SO}(1,10)$ to account for
unbroken supersymmetries $n=1$, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32.  However, the
generalized holonomy conjecture, valid for non-zero $F_{(4)}$, can
account for more exotic fractions of supersymmetry, in particular
$16<n<32$.  The conjectured holonomies are given by ${\cal H} \subset
{\cal G}$ where ${\cal G}$ are the generalized structure groups ${\cal
G}={\rm SO}(d-1,1) \times G(spacelike)$, ${\cal G}= {\rm ISO}(d-1) \times G(null)$
and ${\cal G}={\rm SO}(d) \times G(timelike)$ with $1\leq d<11$.  For example,
$G(spacelike)={\rm SO}(16)$, $G(null)=[{\rm SU}(8) \times {\rm U}(1)]{\kern3pt\hbox{\vrule width 0.4pt height 5.30pt depth
.0pt}\kern-1.76pt\times\kern1pt} {\rm R}^{56}$
and $G(timelike)={\rm SO}^*(16)$ when $d=3$.  Although extending spacetime
symmetries, there is no conflict with the Coleman-Mandula theorem.
The holonomy conjecture rules out certain vacua which are otherwise
permitted by the supersymmetry algebra.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Physics}

M-theory not only provides a non-perturbative unification of the five
consistent superstring theories, but also embraces earlier work on
supermembranes and eleven-dimensional supergravity \cite{World}.  It
is regarded by many as the dreamed-of final theory and has accordingly
received an enormous amount of attention.  It is curious, therefore,
that two of the most basic questions of M-theory have until now remained
unanswered:

i) {\it What are the symmetries of M-theory?}

ii) {\it How many supersymmetries can vacua of M-theory preserve?}

The first purpose of this paper is to argue that M-theory possesses
previously unidentified hidden spacetime (timelike and null) symmetries in
addition to the well-known hidden internal (spacelike) symmetries.  These
take the form of generalized structure groups ${\cal G}$ that replace
the Lorentz group ${\rm SO}(10,1)$.

The second purpose is to argue that the number of supersymmetries
preserved by an M-theory vacuum is given by the number of singlets
appearing in the decomposition of the 32-dimensional representation of
${\cal G}$ under ${\cal G} \supset {\cal H}$ where ${\cal H}$ are
generalized holonomy groups.

The equations of M-theory display the
maximum number of supersymmetries $N$=32, and so $n$, the number of
supersymmetries preserved by a particular vacuum, must be some integer
between 0 and 32.  But are some values of $n$ forbidden and, if so,
which ones?  For quite some time it was widely believed that, aside
from the maximal $n=32$, $n$ is restricted to $0\leq n\leq 16$ with
$n=16$ being realized by the fundamental BPS objects of M-theory: the
M2-brane, the M5-brane, the M-wave and the M-monopole.  The subsequent
discovery of intersecting brane configurations with
$n=0$, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16 lent credence to this argument.  In
\cite{Gauntletthull1}, on the other hand, it was shown that all values
$0\leq n \leq 32$ are allowed by the M-theory algebra \cite{Townsend},
and examples of vacua with $16< n < 32$ have indeed since been found.
Following \cite{Duffstelle} and \cite{Duff}, we here
put forward a {\it generalized holonomy conjecture} according to
which the answer lies somewhere in between.  Evidence in favor of
this conjecture includes the observations that there are no known
counterexamples and that a previously undiscovered example predicted in
\cite{Duff}, namely $n$=14, has recently been found \cite{Harmark}.

As we shall see, these conjectures are based on a group-theoretical argument
which applies to the fully-fledged M-theory.  To get the ball rolling,
however, we begin with the low energy limit of M-theory, namely $D=11$
supergravity.  The unique $D=11$ supermultiplet is comprised of
a graviton $g_{MN}$, a gravitino $\Psi_M$ and $3$-form gauge field
$A_{MNP}$, where $M=0, 1, \ldots 10$, with $44$, $128$ and $84$
physical degrees of freedom, respectively. In section \ref{hidden}, we
conjecture that the supergravity equations of motion for this set of
fields admit hidden timelike and null symmetries (in addition to
previously demonstrated hidden spacelike ones).  Then in section
\ref{holonomy} we demonstrate that, at least in the context of a
dimensionally reduced theory, the $D=11$ Killing spinor equation
indeed has such hidden symmetries.  This allows us to define a
generalized structure group and to analyze the number of
supersymmetries based on generalized holonomy.  We perform the latter
in section \ref{N}, and finally conclude in section \ref{M}.

\section{Hidden spacetime symmetries of D=11 supergravity}
\label{hidden}

Long ago, Cremmer and Julia \cite{Cremmerjulia}
pointed out that, when dimensionally reduced to $d$ dimensions, $D=11$
supergravity exhibits hidden symmetries.  For example ${\rm E}_7(global)
\times {\rm SU}(8)(local)$ when $d=4$ and $E_8(global) \times {\rm SO}(16)(local)$
when $d=3$.  The question was then posed \cite{Fradkin}: do these
symmetries appear magically only after dimensional reduction, or were
they already present in the full uncompactified and untruncated $D=11$
theory?  The question was answered by de Wit and Nicolai
\cite{Dewitnicolai2,Nicolai} who made a $d/(11-d)$ split and fixed the
gauge by setting to zero the off-diagonal components of the elfbein.
They showed that in the resulting field equations the local symmetries
are indeed already present, but the global symmetries are not.  For
example, after making the split ${\rm SO}(10,1) \supset {\rm SO}(3,1) \times
{\rm SO}(7)$, we find the enlarged symmetry ${\rm SO}(3,1) \times {\rm SU}(8)$.  There
is no global ${\rm E}_7$ invariance (although the 70 internal components of
the metric and 3-form may nevertheless be assigned to an ${\rm E}_7/{\rm SU}(8)$
coset).  Similar results were found for other values of $d$: in each
case the internal subgroup ${\rm SO}(11-d)$ gets enlarged to some compact
group $G(spacelike)$ while the spacetime subgroup ${\rm SO}(d-1,1)$ remains
intact%
%
\footnote{We keep the terminology ``spacetime'' and ``internal''
even though no compactification or dimensional reduction is implied.}.
%
In this paper we ask instead whether there are hidden {\it spacetime}
symmetries.  This is a question that could have been asked long ago,
but we suspect that people may have been inhibited by the
Coleman-Mandula theorem which forbids combining spacetime and internal
symmetries \cite{Coleman}.  However, this is a statement about
Poincare symmetries of the S-matrix and here we are concerned
with Lorentz symmetries of the equations of motion, so there will be no
conflict.

The explicit demonstration of $G(spacelike)$ invariance by de Wit and
Nicolai is very involved, to say the least.  However, the result is
quite simple: one finds the same $G(spacelike)$ in the full
uncompactified $D=11$ theory as was already found in the spacelike
dimensional reduction of Cremmer and Julia.  Here we content ourselves
with the educated guess that the same logic applies to $G(timelike)$
and $G(null)$: they are the same as what one finds by timelike and
null reduction, respectively. So we propose
that, after making a $d/(11-d)$ split, the Lorentz subgroup
$G={\rm SO}(d-1,1) \times {\rm SO}(11-d)$ can be enlarged to the
generalized structure groups ${\cal G}={\rm SO}(d-1,1) \times
G(spacelike)$, ${\cal G}= {\rm ISO}(d-1) \times G(null)$ and ${\cal G}= SO(d)
\times G(timelike)$ as shown in Tables~\ref{sgen}, \ref{ngen}
and \ref{tgen}.

Some of the noncompact groups appearing in the Tables may be unfamiliar,
but a nice discussion of their properties may be found in \cite{Gilmore}.
%% Here $H_{2}$ and $H^{*}_{2}$ are infinite
%% dimensional subgroups of an affine
%% $E_{8}$ which contain $SO(16)$ and $SO^{*}(16)$, respectively.
Although the groups $G(spacelike)$, $G(timelike)$ and $G(null)$ are the same as
those obtained from the spacelike dimensional reductions of Cremmer
and Julia \cite{Cremmerjulia}, the timelike
reductions of Hull and Julia \cite{Hulljulia}%
%
\footnote{Actually, for the 8/3 split, we have the factor ${\rm SO}(1,1)$
instead of their ${\rm SO}(2)$.},
%
and the null
reduction of section \ref{genhol}, we emphasize that their physical
interpretation is very different.  They are here proposed as
symmetries of the full $D=11$ equations of motion; there is no
compactification involved, whether toroidal or otherwise.  This
conjecture that these symmetries are present in the full theory and
not merely in its dimensional reductions may be put to the test,
however, as we shall later describe.

\section{Hidden Symmetries and Generalized Holonomy}
\label{holonomy}

We begin by reviewing the connection between holonomy and the number of
preserved supersymmetries, $n$, of supergravity vacua.  This also serves
to define our notation.  Subsequently, we introduce a generalized holonomy
which involves the hidden symmetries conjectured in the previous
section.

\subsection{Riemannian Holonomy}

We are interested in solutions of the bosonic field equations
%
\begin{equation}
R_{MN}=\frac{1}{12}\left(F_{MPQR}F_{N}{}^{PQR}-\frac{1}{12}g_{MN}
F^{PQRS}F_{PQRS}\right)
\end{equation}
%
and
%
