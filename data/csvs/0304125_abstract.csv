One-loop corrections to kink masses in a family of
(1+1)-dimensional field theoretical models with two scalar fields
are computed. A generalized DHN formula applicable to reflection
and reflectionless potentials is obtained. It is thus shown how
half-bound states arising in the spectrum of the second order
fluctuation operator around TK1 kinks and the vacuum play a
central r$\hat{{\rm o}}$le in the computation of the kink Casimir
energy. The issue of whether or not the kink degeneracy exhibited
by this family of models at the classical level survives quantum
fluctuations up to the one-loop order is addressed .
