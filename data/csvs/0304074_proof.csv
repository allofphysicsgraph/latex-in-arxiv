According to Definition~\ref{def_surface},
\begin{equation}
  {\tilde \Phi}_{1234}
  = {\tilde f}^\ast_{124}
    \circ(\id^{(2)}_{{\tilde g}_{12}}\cdot {\tilde f}^\ast_{234})
    \circ({\tilde f}_{123}\cdot\id^{(2)}_{{\tilde g}_{34}})
    \circ{\tilde f}_{134},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_{1234}
  = f^\ast_{124}
    \circ(\id^{(2)}_{g_{12}}\cdot f^\ast_{234})
    \circ(f_{123}\cdot\id^{(2)}_{g_{34}})
    \circ f_{134}.
\end{equation}
The two coloured tetrahedra corresponding to $\Phi_{1234}$ and
${\tilde \Phi}_{1234}$ with the pseudo-natural transformation $\eta$
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig_commutative}. On the faces of this
diagram, there are $2$-morphisms from the strict $2$-functors $F$ and
$\tilde F$ and also from the pseudo-natural transformation $\eta$
which we have suppressed in order to keep the drawing transparent. The
four prisms attached to the triangular faces of the inner tetrahedron
are of the form~\eqref{eq_prism} and therefore $2$-commute. We read
off from the picture that,
\begin{equation}
  {\tilde\Phi}_{1234}=\id^{(2)}_{\eta_1^{-1}}\cdot\Bigl(
  \eta_{14}^\ast
  \circ(\Phi_{1234}\cdot\id^{(2)}_{\eta_4})
  \circ\eta_{14}\Bigr),
\end{equation}
so that $\Phi_{1234}$ and ${\tilde \Phi}_{1234}$ are related by
horizontal composition with identities and by vertical
conjugation. Therefore, the value of $S$ agrees according to
Lemma~\ref{lemma_action}.
