We discuss the instability of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective action (or
its supersymmetric ground-state)\ with respect to  higher order
derivative terms. As such terms must be present in an effective action, the
V-Y action alone cannot describe the dynamics of SYM consistently. We
introduce an extension of this action, where all instabilities are removed by
means of a much richer structure of the K\""ahler potential. We demonstrate that the dominant contributions to the
effective potential are determined by the non-holomorphic part of the action
and we prove that the non-perturbative ground-state can be equipped with
stable dynamics. Making an expansion near the
resulting ground-state to second order in the derivatives  never leads back to the result by Veneziano and
Yankielowicz. As a consequence new dynamical effects arise, which are interpreted as the formation of
massive states in the boson sector (glueballs) and are accompanied by dynamical supersymmetry breaking. As this
regime of the dynamics is not captured by standard semi-classical analysis
(instantons etc.), our results do not contradict these calculations but
investigate the physics of the system beyond these approximations.
