We discuss the 2-point-particle-irreducible $(2PPI)$ expansion,
which sums bubble graphs to all orders, in the context of $SU(N)$
Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge. Using the method we
investigate the possible existence of a gluon condensate of mass
dimension two, $\left\langle A_{\mu}^{a} A_{\mu}^{a}
\right\rangle$, and the corresponding non-zero vacuum energy. This
condensate gives rise to a dynamically generated mass for the
gluon.
