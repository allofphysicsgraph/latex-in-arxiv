We study the
Nonlinear (Polynomial, $N$-fold,...) Supersymmetry algebra in one-dimen\-si\-o\-nal
QM. Its structure is
determined by the type of conjugation operation (Hermitian conjugation or
transposition) and
described with the help of the Super-Hamiltonian
projection on the zero-mode subspace of a supercharge. We show that the
SUSY algebra with transposition symmetry is always polynomial in the
Super-Hamiltonian if
supercharges represent differential operators of finite order.
The appearance of the extended SUSY with several (complex or real)
supercharges
is analyzed in details and it is established that no more than two independent
supercharges
may generate a Nonlinear superalgebra
which  can be appropriately specified as ${\cal N} = 2$
SUSY. In this case we find a non-trivial hidden symmetry operator
and rephrase it
as a non-linear function of the  Super-Hamiltonian on the physical state space.
The full   ${\cal N} = 2$ Non-linear SUSY algebra includes ""central charges""
both polynomial and non-polynomial (due to a symmetry operator)
in the Super-Hamiltonian.
