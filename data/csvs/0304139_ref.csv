generalized   also to  the $AdS_{\N-1}$ case 
using a simple continuation rule as in \pol.

%renormalisations  of the operators  corresponding to each of the 
%two factors in \adss  can be discussed independently. 
%However, the fermionic terms in the action and in the operators 
%may combine to modify the expressions for the anomalous dimensions $\g$ 
%of the operators (separately for the $AdS_5$ and $S^5$ factors)
%already in the 1-loop approximation. 


Let us start with some general remarks. 
Given a sigma model\foot{In general, the sigma model 
should be defined on a curved 2-d background; one 
should include all possible 
couplings to the curvature of the 2-d metric and 
instead of usual scale invariance 
demand the vanishing of the Weyl anomaly 
coefficients. 
In addition to Klein-Gordon-type equation for the tensor 
function,  that leads, as in flat space \wein, 
 also to divergence-free and tracelessness
conditions  (see, e.g., \buch\ and refs. there). }
with the action $S = { 1 \ov \pi \a' } \int d^2 \xi\  G_{mn}(x) 
\del x^m \bd x^n $  one may perturb it by an arbitrary 
higher-dimensional local operator of  the type 
(with total number of 2-d derivatives or level number $Q$)
$V(f) = f_{m_1 ...m_j} (x) \del^{k_1} x^{m_1} .... {\bd}^{k_h} x^{m_j} $
and compute the renormalization of the coupling  tensor 
$f_{m_1 ...m_j}$. Demanding the vanishing of the 
corresponding 
beta-function to linear  order in $f_{m_1...m_j}$
(but to all orders in $\a'G^{mn}$) 
determines the corresponding 
 marginal string vertex operator \calg. 
 The resulting equation  has symbolic form 
 $ \hat \gamma  f = [2- Q +  \ha \a'  \nabla^2 + \a' R_{....}  + 
  \sum \a'^k R....R \nabla...\nabla ] f =0 $,
 where $\hat \gamma$ is the ``anomalous dimension'' operator
 (in which we included also the canonical dimension term).
 For example, a  2-nd rank tensor $f$ (massive spin 2) 
 satisfies a Lichnerowicz-type  equation \buch.
  Solving such  equations  for $f$  is equivalent to finding the
  the eigenvalues and eigen-vectors 
  of the anomalous dimension operator. 
  Unfortunately, the general form of $\hat \g$ operator 
  for generic tensor $f$ and metric $G$  is not known  even 
  to the leading (1-loop) order in $\a'$.
  For this reason,  in most cases
  (with possible exceptions being WZW models or 
  some plane-wave type models) 
   one is not able to  use a universal expression for $\hat \g$ 
   and needs to  calculate 
  the anomalous dimensions of specific higher-derivative 
    operators  starting from  ``first principles''. 
   % i.e. the path integral for a given sigma model.
    
  
  When the sigma model metric $G_{mn}$  has a  large
   global symmetry
  (e.g., corresponds to a symmetric space)
  it is natural to construct the operator  $V(f)$ so that it is 
  covariant under the  global symmetry. In particular, instead 
  of using  local coordinates $x^m$,  we may  write $V(f)$ in terms 
   some   global coordinates on which the group acts linearly. 
  This is what we will do   in the discussion below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


To set up the notation, let us   start with the action of the    $S^{\N-1}$ \sm  action
defined on a complex plane
\eqn\siga{
S = { R^2 \ov 4\pi \a' } \int d^2 \xi\ ( \del_a n_m)^2 
=  { \sql  \ov  \pi  } \int d^2 \xi\  \del n_m \bd n_m   \ , \ \ \ \ \ 
n_m n_m =1  \ , } 
where  $m=1,..., \N$ and  $ \ge \equiv 
{1 \ov  \sql } = { \a' \ov R^2} $ 
plays the role of the standard  dimensionless \sm coupling constant, 
which runs according to the   well-known RG equation\foot{The full 
 \adss string \sm  is of course conformally invariant 
due to additional  fermionic contributions 
to beta-functions of each of the $AdS_5$ and $S^5$ coupling constants 
\mets\ 
coming from the R-R 5-form coupling term.
 %(fermions contribute already in the 1-loop  approximation).
 } 
\eqn\runn{
\dot \ge   = - \epsilon  \ge 
+ (\N-2)  \ge^2  +  (\N-2)  \ge^3  + ... \ , \ \ \ \ \ 
\ \ \ \ \    \ge \equiv   { 1 \ov \sql} \ , \  \ \ \ 
    \epsilon = d-2  \ .   }
In view of the   discussion in the previous section 
 we shall be interested in renormalization of the 
following class of $O(\N)$ covariant 
operators\foot{Since eventually 
we will be interested in operators corresponding to 
states on leading  Regge trajectory we 
do not include terms with multiple derivatives.} 
 \eqn\jij{
O_{\el,s} =  f_{k_1...k_{\el} m_1...m_{2s}}  
n_{k_1} ...  n_{k_\el}  \d n_{m_1} \bd n_{m_2} ...
\d n_{m_{2s-1}} \bd n_{m_{2s}}
 \ . } 
%where the constant tensor $f_{k_1...k_{2n}}$  will be 
%assumed to be traceless.
These form  a special  class of composite 
operators considered in \weg\ (see sects.  8,9 there). 
We shall  assume that $\N$ is even and thus we can split  
the components of $n_k$ into complex  pairs, i.e.
\eqn\jkl{
n_x = n_1 + i n_2 \ , \ \ \  \bnx = n_1 - i n_2 \ , \ \   \ \ \ \ 
n_y = n_3 + i n_4 \ , \ \ ... .  } 
In the  case of  Euclidean $AdS_{\N-1}$  \sm 
 the corresponding  split 
of  the $SO(1,\N-1)$  unit vector 
$N_M$  is into $ N_+,N_-,N_x,...$, where $N_\pm$  are real, 
i.e. $N_+N_- - N_x N_{\bar x} - ... =1$. 

To compute the  1-loop renormalisation of the operators \jij\ one may 
follow the general method of \weg\  and use 
 the following results for ``pairing'' of 
different building blocks of 
composite  operators\foot{We keep only the singular term 
proportional to $I$ and use the notation of 
\weg: $ < A B> $ $ = <A> B + A <B>  + <A,B>$,  where 
 $A$  and $B$ are some operators; if they depend on $n_k(x)$ only 
then $ <A,B> = \int d^2 \xi  d^2 \xi'  <n_k (\xi), n_m (\xi')> 
 { \delta A \ov \delta  n_k (\xi)}   { \delta B \ov  \delta n_m (\xi')} $, etc.
Also,  $ < A(n)> = \ha  \int d^2 \xi d^2 \xi'$ $  <n_k(\xi) , n_m(\xi')> 
 { \delta^2 A \ov \delta  n_k (\xi)  \delta n_m (\xi')  } $.
These pairing rules can be understood also in the 
framework of the   background field method \cast.
Note  that in the process of renormalization 
one is   allowed  to ignore redundant operators proportional to 
equations of motion, e.g., 
$
[ \d \bd n_k - n_k ( \d n_m \bd n_m) ]  C_k (n)$, 
where  $C_k$ is any local operator. } 
\eqn\asd{
<n_k >  = - \ha (\N-1) I n_k \ , \ \ \ 
< n_k , n_l> = - I( n_k n_l  - \delta_{kl}) \ , 
\ \ \  \ \ \ \   I= - { 1 \ov 2 \pi \epsilon}  \to  \infty\ , 
}
 \eqn\opp{
<n_k, \d n_l> = - I \d n_k n_l \ ,\  \ 
 <n_k, \bd n_l> = - I \bd n_k n_l \ ,\  \  }
   \eqn\boom{
 <\d n_k, \d n_l> =  I n_k n_l \d n_m \d n_m \ , \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
 <\bd n_k, \bd n_l> =  I n_k n_l \bd n_m \bd n_m \ , \ }
\eqn\dsa{  <\d n_k ,\bd n_l> = - I (\bd n_k \d n_l -\delta_{kl}  \d n_m \bd n_m )
\ . } 
Contracting indices $k,l$ in \dsa\    we get
$<\d n_k ,\bd n_k> =  I (\N-1) \d n_k \bd n_k $. Then 
 using $<n_k >  = - \ha (\N-1) I n_k $ we conclude that 
\eqn\nadd{   <(\d n_k \bd n_k)> = \d <n_k> \bd n_k  + \d n_k \bd <n_k> +  
<\d n_k ,\bd n_k>  =  0   \  . }
For other scalar contractions one finds \weg\ 
\eqn\coop{
 <(\d n_k \d n_k)> = - (\N-2) I  \d n_k \d n_k\ , \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ 
 <(\bd n_k \bd n_k)> =  - (\N-2) I  \bd n_k \bd n_k\ , \ \ }
 % <(\d n_k \bd n_k)> = 0    \ , }"
