\item (1) Assume a local spatial foliation of 4d spacetime.

\item (2) Deconstruct the vacuum part of pure 4d gravity from 
($N$ copies of) 3d general relativity \cite{wittencs}
coupled to certain 3d 
matter fields represented in terms of currents. Assume that the 4d 
sources can be defined in terms of a deconstructed 3d 
theory. 
For sources represented by gauge fields this should be possible 
given the discussion in Ref.\ \cite{ljm}.

\item (3) In the deep UV we have ($N$ copies of) 3d gravity coupled to some
3d sources.  Whatever the matter content of this
3d theory is, the resulting geometry has to
be conical.  Thus, provided we have 3d (but not 4d!) supersymmetry, 
Witten's argument applies: the vacuum is supersymmetric,
yet the excited states are not.

\item (4) In the range of intermediate scales, we have $N$ linked copies
of 3d gravity coupled to 3d currents. Once again, the resulting 3d 
geometry is conical. Thus Witten's argument holds in
the region between the UV and IR.
