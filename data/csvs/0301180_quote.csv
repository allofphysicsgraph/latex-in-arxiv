We study string-gas cosmology in dilaton gravity, inspired by the fact
that it naturally arises in a string theory context.  Our main interest is the
thermodynamical treatment of the string-gas and the resulting implications for 
the cosmology.  Within an adiabatic approximation, thermodynamical 
equilibrium and a small, toroidal universe as initial conditions, 
we numerically solve the corresponding equations of motions in 
two different regimes describing the 
string-gas thermodynamics: (i) the Hagedorn
regime, with a single scale factor, and (ii) an almost-radiation 
dominated regime, which includes the leading corrections due to the 
lightest Kaluza Klein and winding modes, with two scale factors.  
The scale factor in the Hagedorn
regime exhibits very slow time evolution with 
nearly constant energy and
negligible pressure. By contrast, in case (ii) we find interesting cosmological
solutions where the large dimensions continue to expand and the small ones
are kept undetectably small.
