obtain a noncommutative theory of pure Einstein theory in four dimensions.
In order to do that, we use Seiberg-Witten map. It is shown that the
noncommutative torsion constraint is solved by the vanishing of
commutative torsion. Finally, the noncommutative corrections to the action
are computed up to second order.
