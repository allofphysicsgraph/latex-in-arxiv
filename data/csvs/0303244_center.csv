\abstract{
We study the qualitative features of the
QCD phase diagram in the context of the
linear quark-meson model with two flavours, 
using the exact renormalization group.
We identify the universality classes of the second-order phase
transitions and calculate critical exponents. 
In the absence of explicit chiral-symmetry breaking
through the current quark masses, we 
discuss in detail the tricritical point 
and demonstrate that it is linked to the Gaussian fixed point.
In its vicinity
we study the universal crossover between the Gaussian and $O(4)$ fixed points,
and the weak first-order phase transitions.
In the presence of explicit chiral-symmetry breaking, we study in
detail the critical endpoint of the line of first-order phase transitions.
We demonstrate the decoupling of pion fluctuations and identify the
Ising universality class as the relevant one for the second-order phase
transition.
