\item The Manin plane is always an eligible candidate.
$$
\hat x \, \hat y = q \, \hat y \, \hat x.
$$
We consider normal ordering, i.e., a normal ordered monomial has the form
\be 
:\hat y^3\, \hat x^2\, \hat y: \, = \hat x^2\, \hat y^4.
\ee
Following the above prescription, we end up at the following $*$-product
\cite{Madore:2000en}
\be
f*g\,(x,y) = q^{ - \tilde x {\partial\over\partial \tilde x} y {\partial \over 
\partial y} }  f(x,y)\, g(\tilde x,\tilde y)\Big|_{\tilde x \to x \atop
\tilde y \to y}\, .
\ee

\item As a further example we want to quote the $*$-products on 
$q$-deformed Euclidean space in $3$ dimensions and of the 
$q$-Minkowski space \cite{Wachter:2001gk,Bauer:2002nt}. 
These products are more involved than the one on the Manin plane, but still the
structures show many similarities.



In case of the q-deformed $3$ dimensional Euclidean space, the algebra of
functions is generated by the coordinates $\hat x^+,\hat x^3, \hat x^-$. Again,
we consider normal ordering,
$$
:(\hat x^3)^{i_3}\, (\hat x^+)^{i_+}\, (\hat x^-)^{i_-}: \, = 
(\hat x^+)^{i_+}\, (\hat x^3)^{i_3}\, (\hat x^-)^{i_-}.
$$
The $*$-product is quoted as 
\be
f*g = 
\sum_{i=0}^\infty\lambda^i  \frac{x_3^{2i}}{[[i]]_{q^4}!}\,\,q^{2(\hat{\sigma}_3 
\hat{\sigma}'_++\hat{\sigma}_-\hat{\sigma}'_3)}\left(D_{q^4}^-\right)^i\!\! 
f(x)\cdot \left(D_{q^4}^+\right)^i\!\! g(x')\Big|_{x'\to x}\, ,
\ee
where $D_q^A\! f(x)=\frac{f(x_A)-f(qx_A)}{x_A-qx_A}$ is the discrete Jackson 
derivative and
$q^{\hat{\sigma}_A}=q^{x_A\frac{\partial}{\partial x_A}}$, where no summation is
implied. In \cite{Wachter:2001gk}
the $*$-product is also calculated in the four dimensional case.
However, the q-deformed Minkowski space resembles a much more complicated
structure than $4$ dimensional Euclidean space. Therefore the $*$-product is
much more involved, too. Again, we will only quote the result and will not
bother about the details. The coordinates are $\hat x^0, \hat x^+, \hat{\tilde
x}^3, \hat x^-$, normal odering is defined by monomials of the form
$ \hat x^0 \hat x^+ \hat{\tilde x}^3 \hat x^-$.
The $*$-product reads
\bea
f*g & = & \sum_{i=0}^\infty \left( \frac{\lambda_-}{\lambda_+} \right)^i 
	\sum_{k+j=i}  \frac{R_{k,j}\,(\underline{x})}{[[k]]_{q^2}!\,\, 
	[[j]]_{q^2}!}\,\, q^{(2\hat\sigma_3+\hat\sigma_-+i)\hat\sigma'_+ 
 	+(2\hat\sigma'_3+\hat\sigma'_++i)\hat\sigma_-}\times\\ 
& \times & \left[ (D^-_{q^2})^i\! f\right] \!\! (x_0,x_+,\tilde{x}_3,
	q^{j-k}x_-)\cdot \left[ (D^+_{q^2})^i\! g\right]\!\! 
	(x'_0,q^{j-k}x'_+,\tilde{x}'_3,x'_-)\Big|_{x'\to x} \, ,
\eea
where $R_{k,j}\,(\underline{x})= R_{k,j}\,(x^0, x^+, \tilde{x}^3, \hat x^-)$ is 
some polynomial in the coordinates.

\item SW maps provide solutions to the gauge equivalence relations.

\item Gauge equivalence relations are not the only possibile approach
to SW maps. 
Another approach is via nc Wilson lines, see e.g., \cite{Liu:2000mj}.

\item However, a certain ambiguity in the SW map remains. They are unique
modulo classical field redefinition and nc gauge transformation.
We used these ambiguities in order to choose $\widehat\Lambda$, 
$\widehat A_\mu$ hermitian. The freedom in SW map may also be essential for
renormalisation issues. There, parameters characterising the freedom in the
SW maps become running coupling constants \cite{Bichl:2001cq}.
Discussing tensor products of gauge groups, this freedom will also be of crucial
importance in Section \ref{secncsm}.

\item Gauge groups in non-commutative spaces contain space-time translations.
Since
\be
\partial f = -i\theta^{-1}_{ij}[x^j,f],
\ee
we can express the translation of the field $A_i$ as 
\be
\delta A_i = v^j\partial_j A_i = i[\epsilon\stackrel{*}{,}A_i],
\ee
\label{ay}
where $\epsilon = - v^j \theta^{-1}_{jk} x^k$. The gauge transformation of 
$A_i$  with gauge parameter $\epsilon$ gives
$$
\hat \delta_\epsilon A_i = i[\epsilon\stackrel{*}{,}A_i] - v^j\theta^{-1}_{ji}.
$$
This agrees with (\ref{ay}), ignoring the overall constant, which has no
physical effect \cite{Douglas:2001ba}.

\item NC gauge theory allows the construction of realistic particle models 
on a nc space-time with an arbitrary gauge group as internal symmetry group.
Nc gauge parameters and gauge fields are enveloping algebra valued, in general
(e.g., for $SU(n)$), but via SW maps the
infinite number of degrees of freedom is reduced to the
classical gauge parameters. Therefore these models will have the proper number 
of degrees of freedom.

\item The action of the NCSM (\ref{b.1}) has been expanded up to first order in 
the non-commutativity $\theta$ \cite{Calmet:2001na}. To $0^\textrm{th}$ order, 
we get the commutative standard model.

\item The different interactions cannot be considered seperately in
the NCSM, since we had to introduce the overall gauge field $V_\mu$ in 
(\ref{d.11}). They mix due to the SW maps, where the nc gauge field is given by
$\widehat V = \widehat V [V]$.

\item Higgs mechanism and Yukawa sector can be implemented in NCSM. The masses of
the gauge bosons and fermions equal those of the Standard Model on commutative 
space-time, at tree level.

\item There is no coupling of the Higgs to the electromagnetic Photon, 
in the minimal version. That coupling might be expected due to eqn. (\ref{d.14}).

\item Furtheron, no self interaction of the $U(1)_Y$ bosons occur, as one can see
from the expansion of the gauge kinetic terms. Vertices with five and six gauge 
bosons for $SU(3)_C$ and $SU(2)_L$ are present.

\item UV/IR mixing \cite{Minwalla:1999px} is not present due to $\theta$ 
expansion.

\item New decay modes for hadrons are found, $2$ Quarks-Gluon-Photon vertex 
occur.

\item One has to search for experimental signature for non-commutativity. 
One suggestion is to search for $Z\to\gamma\gamma$ decays in the non-minimal 
NCSM \cite{Behr:2002wx} or other decays forbidden by Lorentz symmetry 
\cite{Trampetic:2002eb}.

\item Other suggestions come from astrophysics. A weak limit on the 
non-commutative scale is proposed in \cite{Schupp:2002up}. The coupling of
neutrinos to photons implies new energy loss mechanisms in stars. This leads to
an estimate for the non-commutativity scale. In the context of 
$\kappa$-deformation, it has been argued to search for observable effects in 
time delays of high-energy $\gamma$ rays or neutrinos from active gallaxies, 
such as Markarian 142. These effects are due to modified dispersion relations, 
see e.g., \cite{kosmos}.
