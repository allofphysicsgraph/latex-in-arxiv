\caption{The ratio of field energy density to the radiation density due to Born-Infeld matter at the end of inflation 
is plotted against $\alpha$ ( for the model
of Eq (\ref{exppot})). The ratio is of the order of $10^{7}$ and saturates nearly at $6 \times 10^6$ for large values of $\alpha$.

\caption{ The post inflationary evolution of energy density for the scalar field (solid line) radiation (dashed line-Born-Infeld matter) and cold dark matter (dotted line) is shown as a function of the scale factor in case of the model described by 
Eq (\ref{cosine}) with $V_0\simeq 1.6 \times 10^{-30} M_p$,
$\tilde{\alpha}=25$ and $p=0.2$. Briefly after the brane effects are over, the field energy density $\rho_{\phi}$ enters the kinetic regime and then overshoots the background. After a short while it turns to the background and tracks it for a long time till the field
reaches the origin and rapid oscillations commence in the system allowing the universe to accelerate at late times. The evolution
is shown from the end of inflation ($a_i \equiv a_{end}=1$) to the present epoch (the value of scale factor $a \simeq 10^{25}$ corresponds to the present epoch)

\caption{The dimensionless density parameter is plotted as a function of scale factor for the model described in figure \ref{den}.
Solid line corresponds to scalar field, dashed to Born-Infeld radiation and dotted to cold dark matter. Late time oscillations with
with negative average equation of state parameter give rise to current epoch of cosmic acceleration with $\Omega_{\phi}=0.7$ and
$\Omega_{m}=0.3$.
