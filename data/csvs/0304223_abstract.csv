We provide a method and the results  for the calculation of  the holonomy of a Yang-Mills connection in 
an  arbitrary triangular path, in an expansion (developed here to fifth order) in powers of the corresponding 
segments. The results might have applications in generalizing to Yang-Mills fields previous calculations  of  
the corrections to particle dynamics induced by loop quantum gravity,  as well as in the field of random lattices.
