ABSTRACT: In this paper, we study the cosmological evolution of
imaginary configuration for scalar fields with an O(\textit{N})
symmetry and discuss that it is possible to realize the
equation-of-state parameter $w<-1$. We show that the introduction
of negative kinetic energy of scalar fields could be equivalently
realized by a vector anti-unitary representation of the
O(\textit{N}) group. When the fields are constrained with an
O(\textit{N}) symmetry, they are more stable than that without
symmetry. In the exponential potential, the O(\textit{N}) phantom
field imposes a lower bound for the equation of state $w>-2$. We
also derive the relations between the potential of the field and
the red-shift, known as reconstruction equations.
