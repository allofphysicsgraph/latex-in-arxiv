As a step to understand general patterns of 
integrability in $1+1$ quantum field theories 
with supergroup symmetry, we study in details the 
case of  $OSP(1/2)$. Our results include the solutions of natural
generalizations of models with ordinary group symmetry: the
$UOSP(1/2)_{k}$ WZW model with a current current perturbation,  
 the $UOSP(1/2)$ principal chiral model, and 
 the $UOSP(1/2)\otimes UOSP(1/2)/UOSP(1/2)$ coset models perturbed by
the adjoint. Graded parafermions are also discussed. A pattern peculiar 
to supergroups is the emergence of
another class of models, whose simplest representative is the
$OSP(1/2)/OSP(0/2)$ sigma model, where the  (non unitary) 
orthosymplectic symmetry is realized non linearly
(and can be spontaneously broken). For most models, we provide an integrable
lattice realization. We show in particular that integrable $osp(1/2)$
spin chains with integer spin flow to $UOSP(1/2)$ WZW models in the
continuum limit, hence providing what is to our knowledge the first
physical realization of a super WZW model.
