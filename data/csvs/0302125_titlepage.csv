\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we review the fundamental framework of boundary string field 
theory (BSFT) and 
apply it to the tachyon condensation on non-BPS systems in the 
superstring theory. 
The boundary string field theory can be regarded as a natural 
extension of the nonlinear sigma model. By 
using this theory we can describe the tachyon condensation exactly and also 
obtain the effective actions on non-BPS systems consisting of the 
Dirac-Born-Infeld type action and the Wess-Zumino type action. Especially the 
Wess-Zumino action is written by superconnection and coincides 
with the mathematical argument by K-theory. Moreover we also discuss the 
tachyon condensation keeping the conformal invariance (on-shell). The exact 
argument by using the boundary state formalism gives a good support to the 
conjecture of the tachyon condensation and it is also consistent with boundary 
string field theory.
