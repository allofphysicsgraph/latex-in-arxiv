\item $\N$ contains an affine $SU(2)$ symmetry at level $4k$.
\item In the quotient of $\N$ by each one of the three $SU(2)$ supercurrents
$\chi^a + \theta K^a$,
the worldsheet supersymmetry is extended to $N=2$,
and the corresponding three $U(1)$ R-currents $M^a$ satisfy \emerota.
\"
1,"\begin{enumerate}
\item They are orthogonal.
\item They have the same normalization.
\item They commute with the three $SL(2,R)$ currents,
so they lie entirely in $\N$.
