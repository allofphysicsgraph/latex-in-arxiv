\begin{abstract}
Recently, gauged supergravities in three dimensions with Yang-Mills
and Chern-Simons type interactions have been constructed. In this
article, we demonstrate that any gauging of Yang-Mills type with
semisimple gauge group ${\rm G}_0$, possibly including extra couplings
to massive Chern-Simons vectors, is equivalent on-shell to a pure
Chern-Simons type gauging with non-semisimple gauge group ${\rm
G}_0\ltimes {\rm T}\subset {\rm G}$, where ${\rm T}$ is a certain
translation group, and where ${\rm G}$ is the maximal global symmetry
group of the ungauged theory. We discuss several examples.

\section{Introduction}

As borne out by recent work, gauged supergravities in three spacetime
dimensions come in more guises than the corresponding models in
dimensions $D\geq 4$. This variety of theories is not least due to
the fact that in three dimensions vector and scalar fields are related
by duality (see e.g.~\cite{CJLP98} for a general discussion of such
dualities). The on-shell equivalence of scalars and vectors in three
dimensions is not only reflected in a much larger choice of gauge
groups but also in the (co-)existence of both Chern-Simons (CS) type
gaugings and Yang-Mills (YM) type gaugings, depending on which
fields carry the propagating bosonic degrees of freedom.

YM type gaugings can be obtained alternatively by direct construction,
by torus reduction of gauged supergravities in higher dimensions to
three dimensions, or by Kaluza Klein reduction on non-flat internal
manifolds to three space-time dimensions
(see~\cite{LuPoTo97,CvLuPo00,LuPoSe02} for examples of such
constructions).  Examples of CS type gaugings were first obtained for
$N\!=\!2$ supergravity with an abelian gauge
group~\cite{DKSS00}. Maximal ($N\!=\!16$) and half maximal ($N\!=\!8$)
gauged supergravities of CS type with various compact and non-compact
semisimple gauge groups were constructed in~\cite{NicSam00} and
\cite{NicSam01b}, respectively (the relevant gauge groups are
subgroups of $"
