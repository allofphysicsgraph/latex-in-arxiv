\item {\em All directions non-compact and expanding:} Brane
interactions are frozen out and  branes are leftover. This
corresponds to the case where dynamical compactification of the
extra dimensions occurs after brane production.

\item {\em All directions non-compact and static:} Interactions do
not have to fight cosmic expansion. Thus all of the branes
disappear if the directions are static for a sufficiently long
period.  This may correspond to an initial state where all the
dimensions are initially non-compact, static and some directions
are later dynamically compactified.

\item {\em All directions non-compact, $d^{nc}_H$ are expanding,
$d^{nc}_s$ are static; branes fill only static directions:}  The
distance between branes and anti-branes  expands. Hence
interactions are frozen out and branes do not annihilate fast
enough. (This corresponds to the case of  $p \le d^{nc}_s$, or $p
\le 6$ if $d^{nc}_H=4$).

\item {\em All directions non-compact, $d^{nc}_H$ are expanding,
$d^{nc}_s$ are static; branes fill only the expanding directions:}
This corresponds to $p = d^{nc}_H$ or $p=3$ for $d^{nc}_H=4$. As
the branes are separated only in the non-expanding compact
directions, they do not feel the expansion and interact unhindered
by the expansion. Thus if non-expanding directions are static for
a sufficiently long period, virtually all of the $D(d^{nc}_H-1)$
branes  disappear.

\item {\em All directions non-compact, $d^{nc}_H$ are expanding,
$d^{nc}_s$ are static; branes fill $p_H$ expanding directions and
fill $p_s$ static directions:} As long as the branes move in some
expanding directions they do not annihilate efficiently.  This
only happens if $p_H <d^{nc}_H$.

\item {\em All directions compact and static:} There is no
expansion for interactions to fight. All the branes disappear if
the compact directions are static for a sufficiently long period.

\item {\em All directions compact and expanding:} Expansion will
eventually kill off interactions and brane anti-brane remnants
remain. However, if as in~\cite{bv2,bv3} the dilaton is allowed to
vary, then via some dilaton dynamics the branes may be able to
halt the expansion of the compact directions for a period
sufficiently long for them to annihilate.

\item {\em All directions compact, $d^c_H$  are expanding, $d^c_s$
are static; branes wrap only static directions:} The branes
effectively behave like point particles moving in a non-compact
spacetime.  They do not disappear.

\item {\em All directions compact, $d^c_H$ are expanding, $d^c_s$
are static; branes fill only expanding directions:} This is again
the case of expanding branes moving in a static space. The branes
disappear.

\item {\em All directions compact, $d^c_H$ are expanding, $d^c_s$
are static; branes wrap $p_H$ expanding directions and wrap $p_s$
static directions:} The compact directions which the branes wrap
will act to only dimensionally reduce the branes which move in the
expanding directions.  This then reduces to scenario 7.


\item {\em There are $d^c$ compact directions, $d^{nc}$
non-compact directions. The compact directions are static, and the
non-compact directions are expanding. } Branes with $p<d_{nc}$
feel the expansion and do not disappear.  For $p \ge  d_{nc}$
then: (a) if the branes completely fill the expanding directions
(e.g. non-compact $D3$ branes in a 4+6 split of spacetime) then
they  disappear; (2) if the branes only partially fill the
expanding directions and wrap $p_w$ directions such $p-p_w
<d_{nc}$ then the branes feel the expansion and create a remnant
problem; (3) in the unlikely case that all of the branes are
coincident in the non-compact directions the brane separation is
oblivious to the expansion and the branes  disappear.




\item {\em This is the most general case. There are $d^c$ compact
directions, $d^{nc}$ non-compact directions. $d^c_H$ compact and
$d^{nc}_H$ non-compact directions are expanding.  $d^c_s$ compact
and $d^{nc}_s$ non-compact directions are static.}  Branes  move
in the expanding non-compact directions if $p<d^{nc}_H$, and thus
do not disappear.  If $p \ge d^{nc}_H$ then branes  still do not
dissappear if they do not completely fill the non-compact space,
i,e., if $p-p_w < d^{nc}_H$.  If at the same time the branes wrap
some of the expanding directions, then either the wrapped branes
must halt the expansion of the expanding compact directions or the
brane remnants will remain. If they do do halt the such expansion
then the brane density  tends to zero.

\item{\em The case of some compact contracting directions}
Contracting directions do not shrink distances in the expanding
directions. Thus contraction is unlikely to aid brane
annihilation. However, this deserves further investigation.
