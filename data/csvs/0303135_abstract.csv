We study parity symmetries and crosscap states
in classes of ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum field theories in
$1+1$ dimensions, including non-linear sigma models,
gauged WZW models,
Landau-Ginzburg models, and linear sigma models.
The parity anomaly and its cancellation
play important roles in many of them.
The case of the ${\mathcal N}=2$
minimal model are studied in complete detail, from all 
three realizations
--- gauged WZW model, abstract RCFT, and LG models.
We also identify mirror pairs of orientifolds, extending the correspondence
between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry by including
unorientable worldsheets.
Through the analysis in various models and comparison in the overlapping
regimes, we obtain a global picture of orientifolds and D-branes.
