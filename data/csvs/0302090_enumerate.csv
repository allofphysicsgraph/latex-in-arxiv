	\end{eqnarray}

	Let us embed the manifold in $3$ dimensional Euclidean spaces.
	When the hyperplane has the rotational symmetry, the line element can be written using the cylindrical coordinates
	\begin{eqnarray}
	ds^2=(dh)^2 +(d \rho)^2 +\rho^2 (d \phi)^2.\label{line-1}
	\end{eqnarray}
	Where the height is a function of the radius $\rho$, 
	\begin{eqnarray}
	h=g(\rho).\label{h}
	\end{eqnarray}
	From eq.(\ref{h}), the line element can be rewritten
	\begin{eqnarray}
	ds^2 =(1+(g' (\rho))^2)(d \rho)^2 +\rho^2 (d\phi)^2,\label{line-3}
	\end{eqnarray}
	where $g'$ is the derivative of the function $g(\rho)$ in term of $\rho$.
	Now we transform the line element for the target metric (\ref{CFT-metric}) 
	to the form of eq.(\ref{line-3}) by a change of variable
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\rho=\frac{r}{\sqrt{1+a r^2}},
	\end{eqnarray}
	which is a one-to-one mapping from the entire plane $0\le r < \infty$ to a disc $0\le \rho <\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}$.
	Then eq.(\ref{line-2}) can be rewritten
	\begin{eqnarray}
	ds^2 =\frac{1}{(1-a \rho^2)^2}(d \rho)^2 +\rho^2 (d \phi)^2.\label{line-4}
	\label{embed1}
	\end{eqnarray}
	Comparing eq.(\ref{line-3}) with eq.(\ref{line-4}), we obtain the height function $h=g(\rho)$ as follow:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	h&=&\int_0^{\rho} d \rho g'(\rho)
	=\int_0^{\rho} d \rho \sqrt{\frac{1}{(1-a \rho^2)^2}-1}\nonumber\\
	&=&-\frac{1}{2\sqrt{a}} \Big(\ln |\frac{\sqrt{2-a \rho^2}-1}{\sqrt{2-a \rho^2}+1}|+2\sqrt{2-a \rho^2}-\ln |\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{2}+1}| -2\sqrt{2} \Big)\nonumber\\\label{h-final}.
	\end{eqnarray}
	Figure \ref{fig:Euclidean} shows the manifold embedded in $3$-dimensional flat Euclidean spaces.
	The distance between any two points is measured along the shortest path on the surface in the Euclidean spaces.
	
	
	\item When $a<0$, the anomalous dimension is positive. \\
	In this case, the metric and scalar curvature read
	\begin{eqnarray}
	g_{i \bar{j}}&=&\frac{1}{1-|a|x}\\
	R&=&\frac{-|a|}{1-|a|x}.
	\end{eqnarray}
	This metric is ill-defined at the boundary $|z| \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{-a}}$.
	It is not merely the coordinates singularity because the scalar curvature is divergent at the boundary.
	Although the volume integral is divergent, the distance to the boundary is finite.
	Now, let us embed this manifold in flat space.
	Note the eq.(\ref{h-final}) is imaginary if $a<0$.
	Thus the manifold is embedded as a space-like surface in the flat Minkowski space.
	Figure \ref{fig:Minkowski} shows the manifold embedded in the $3$-dimensional flat Minkowski space.

1,"\begin{enumerate}
	\item $a>0$ case\\
	Figure \ref{fig:aFax} show the function $f'$, which is the diagonal component of the target metric, goes to infinity as $x \rightarrow \infty$. When $aF$ goes to infinity, the $r=0$ term of eq.(\ref{exact-sol}) gives the dominant contribution in the left-hand side. To find the asymptotic behavior in this region, we retain only the dominant terms and solve
	\begin{eqnarray}
	e^{aF} (aF)^{N-1} \approx \frac{1}{N}(ax)^N.\label{N=2}
	\end{eqnarray}
	by the iteration method
	\begin{eqnarray}
	aF&\approx&\ln \Big(\frac{(ax)^N}{N} \Big) -(N-1)\ln (aF)\nonumber\\
	&=&\ln \Big(\frac{(ax)^N}{N} \Big) -(N-1)\ln \ln \Big(\frac{(ax)^N}{N} \Big)
	+\cdots.\nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	where we dropped other terms that vanish as $ax \rightarrow \infty$.
	Then we obtain the functions $f'$  
	\begin{eqnarray}
	f'&\approx& \frac{1}{ax} \ln \frac{(ax)^N}{N}-\frac{N-1}{ax} \ln \ln \frac{(ax)^N}{N}+ \cdots .\label{fprime}	
	\end{eqnarray} 
	The distance along the straight line in the radial direction is written 
	\begin{eqnarray}
	g_{i \bar{j}} dz^i dz^{*\bar{j}}&=&(f' \delta_{i \bar{j}}+f'' z_{\bar{j}}z^*_{i}) dz^i dz^{*\bar{j}} \nonumber\\
	&\approx&(f'+|r|^2 f'')|dr|^2=\frac{N}{a|r|^2}|dr|^2 \label{asympto2}
	\end{eqnarray}
	Here we have defined the complex radial coordinate $r$ and the angle variables by
	\begin{eqnarray}
	z^1=u^1 r, \ \cdots\ , \ z^{N-1}=u^{N-1}r,\  z^N=r. \label{cpn}
	\end{eqnarray}
	
	The asymptotic behavior (\ref{asympto2}) for any $N$ is similar to $N=1$ case,    in which the metric in the asymptotic region is given by
	\begin{eqnarray}
	g_{1 \bar{1}}\approx \frac{1}{ax}.\label{aympto1}
	\end{eqnarray}
	The asymptotic behavior of the K\""{a}hler potential (\ref{SUN}) can be found by integrating eq.(\ref{fprime}) 
	\begin{eqnarray}
	K(zz^*) & \approx & \frac{N}{2a}(\log{(azz^*)})^2+\cdots\nonumber\\
	&=& \chi\chi^*+2{\sqrt{\frac{N}{a}}}{\frak Re}{\chi}\log{\left(1+|u^1|^2+\cdots +|u^{N-1}|^2\right)}+\cdots \label{kpcp}
	\end{eqnarray}
	where we have dropped holomorphic and anti-holomorphic terms by a K\""{a}hler transformation and defined $\chi$ by
	\begin{eqnarray}
	\chi=\sqrt{\frac{N}{a}}\log{\sqrt{a}r}.\label{fieldtr}
	\end{eqnarray}
	For fixed values of the radius $r$, (\ref{kpcp}) is the K\""{a}hler potential for the Fubini-Study metric of the complex projective space $CP^{N-1}$, whose size is fixed by ${\frak Re}{\chi}$. Therefore, our target space is the direct product of the complex line represented by $\chi$ and the $CP^{N-1}$ represented by $(u^1,\cdots,u^{N-1})$ in the asymptotic region.
	
	
	\item $a<0$ case \\
	Figure \ref{fig:aFax} shows that the allowed region $ax\le 0$ is limited inside of a ball $|\vec{z}|<(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{|a|})^\frac{1}{2}$ for $N=2$ as in the case of $N=1$. By assuming $ax \sim -\sqrt{2}+\epsilon$ near the boundary,  we can reduce eq.(\ref{N=2}) to
	\begin{eqnarray}
	e^{aF} aF \sim -\sqrt{2}\epsilon\nonumber
	\end{eqnarray} 
	which can be solved by the iteration method
	\begin{eqnarray}
		-aF &=& \ln \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\epsilon}+\ln (-aF)\nonumber\\
	&=&\ln \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\epsilon} +\ln\ln (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\epsilon}) +\cdots .\nonumber
	\end{eqnarray}
	Because of $\epsilon<<1$, the behavior of the function $f'=\frac{F}{ax}$ near the boundary is given
	\begin{eqnarray}
	f' \sim \frac{1}{ax} \ln (1+\frac{ax}{\sqrt{2}}),\label{N=2-2}
	\end{eqnarray}
	which leads to the curvature singularity at the boundary. 
	
	
	Similarly, the allowed region in $z$-plane for general $N$ is 
	\begin{eqnarray}
	|\vec{z}|<(N!)^{\frac{1}{2N}}|a|^{-\frac{1}{2}}.
	\end{eqnarray}
	The asymptotic behavior of the function $f'$ near the boundary 
	\[
	f'(x)\sim \frac{1}{ax}\ln (1+\frac{ax}{(N!)^{1/N}})
	\]
	leads to the curvature singularity at the boundary.
