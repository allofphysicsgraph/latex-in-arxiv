\begin{abstract}
We discuss D-braneworld cosmology, that is, the brane is described by the 
Born-Infeld action. Compared with the usual Randall-Sundrum braneworld cosmology 
where the brane action is the Nambu-Goto one, we can see some 
drastic changes at the very early universe: (i)universe may experience the 
rapid accelerating phase 
(ii)the closed universe may avoid the initial 
singularity. We also briefly address the dynamics of the cosmology in the open 
string metric, which might be  favorer than the induced metric from the 
view point of the D-brane.

\section{Introduction}

One of the motivation for the braneworld is originated by the genius of D-brane, that is, 
open strings describing the Standard Model particles stick to the brane. So if one is serious 
about this, we must employ the effective action for D-brane, Born-Infeld action, not 
the Nambu-Goto membrane action\cite{BI}. In the presence of the matters on the brane, 
the difference between the above two actions will appear. 

The simplest braneworld model was proposed by Randall and Sundrum\cite{RSI,RSII} and 
subsequently extended 
to the cosmology by many peoples\cite{Tess,Roy,cosmos}. 
However, the action for the brane is often assumed to be 
the Nambu-Goto action and the action for the matters on the brane is simply added by 
direct sum. In this paper we explore the cosmology on the D-brane (Related to the 
tachyon condensation, the tachyon matter on the brane has been 
also considered in the braneworld\cite{Mukohyama}). 
As seen soon, our starting point is the 5-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action plus the  
Born-Infeld action (we call this D-braneworld). Then we consider the radiation 
dominated universe on the D-brane. In this situation the brane action is described by Born-Infeld 
one where the matter term is automatically included. 

Here reminded that 
there is non-trivial aspect for the interpretation on the D-brane. According to Seiberg and 
Witten\cite{SW}, the metric for the gauge field on the brane is given by $\stackrel{\scriptscriptstyle {s}}{g}_{\mu\nu}
=g_{\mu\nu}-(2\pi \alpha')^2(F^2)_{\mu\nu}$, not just the induced metric $g_{\mu\nu}$. $F$ 
represents the field strength of the gauge fields on the brane. 
For this we will discuss the cosmology in the both 
metric. See Ref.~\cite{Causal} for the causality issue.  

Another motivation to think of the D-braneworld is the magnetogenesis in the very early universe
(See Ref.~\cite{PMF} for the comprehensive review and references). 
The coherent magnetic field over the horizon scale currently has the limit 
$B < 10^{-9}{\rm Gauss}$ from the cosmic microwave background anisotropy\cite{Silk}. 
If such magnetic field with long coherent length actually exists, we must seek for 
its primordial origin, especially in the inflating stage of the universe.  It is well-known 
that the magnetic field cannot be generated due to the conformal invariance of 
the Maxwell theory in four dimension\cite{Parker}. But, the conformal invariance is broken due to 
the non-linearity in the Born-Infeld 
theory. Thus we might be able to have a magnetogenesis scenario during the inflation on the
D-braneworld. 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec.~\ref{Setup}, we describe the setup for 
D-braneworld. We also comment on a holographic aspects in the D-braneworld. 
In Sec.~\ref{Cosmological}, we will focus on the radiation dominated cosmology in the 
induced metric.  First, we will average the energy-momentum tensor over the volume to 
obtain the equation of state. And then we will see that the universe may be accelerating at the very 
early stage and the closed universe could avoid the initial singularities. 
In Sec.~\ref{Cosmology}, we briefly 
reconsider the cosmology in the open string metric. In Sec.~\ref{Summary}, we give the summary and 
discussion.  See Refs.~\cite{BIcosmos,BIcosmos2,BIBH} 
for other issues on the Born-Infeld cosmology/black holes and Ref.~\cite{Gas} for 
D-brane effect in the different context.

\section{Setup}
\label{Setup}

The total action is composed of the bulk and the D-brane action:
%===========<Equation>============%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S=S_{\rm bulk} +S_{\rm BI},
\end{eqnarray}
%
%=================================%
where $S_{\rm bulk}$ is the 5-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action with the negative 
cosmological constant and $S_{\rm BI}$ is the Born-Infeld action for D-brane:
%===========<Equation>============%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\rm BI}=-\sigma \int d^4 x {\sqrt {-{\rm det}(g_{\mu\nu}+ (2\pi \alpha')F_{\mu\nu}) }},
\end{eqnarray}
%
%=================================%
where $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength of the Maxwell theory on the brane. So $F_{\mu\nu}$ will 
correspond to 
the cosmic microwave background radiation if one thinks of the homogeneous and isotropic 
universe as discussed later. In the Born-Infeld action the matter part is automatically 
included. In the usual braneworld, on the other hand, 
we assume that the action on the brane is given by the 
Nambu-Goto action, $S_{\rm NG} \sim -\sigma \int d^4 {\sqrt{-g}}$, plus the matter 
action $S_{\rm matter}$, in particular, $S_{\rm matter} \propto \int d^4 x {\sqrt {-g}}F^2$ 
for the Maxwell field on the brane.  

In four dimensions $S_{\rm BI}$ becomes 
%===========<Equation>============%
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\rm BI} & = & -\sigma \int d^4 x {\sqrt {-g}} \biggl[
1-\frac{1}{2}(2\pi\alpha')^2{\rm Tr}(F^2) \nonumber \\
 & & ~ +\frac{1}{8}(2\pi\alpha')^4 \bigl({\rm Tr}(F^2)\bigr)^2-\frac{1}{4}(2\pi\alpha')^4 {\rm
Tr}(F^4)\biggr]^{1/2} 
\nonumber \\
& = & -\sigma \int d^4x {\sqrt {-g}}\biggl[1-\frac{1}{4}(2\pi\alpha')^2{\rm Tr}(F^2) \nonumber \\
& & ~+\frac{1}{32}(2\pi\alpha')^4\bigl({\rm Tr}(F^2)\bigr)^2-\frac{1}{8}(2\pi\alpha')^4{\rm
Tr}(F^4) 
\nonumber \\
& & ~+O(\alpha'^6) \biggr]. \label{BIaction}
\end{eqnarray}
%
%=================================%
{}From the first to the second line we expanded the square root and wrote down the 
expression up to the order of $O(\alpha'^4)$. For the practice and simplicity, hereafter, 
we employ this approximated action to discuss the {\it whole} history of cosmology. 
The energy-momentum tensor on the brane is given by 
%===========<Equation>============%
%
