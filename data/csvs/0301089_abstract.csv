An explicitly exact superconformal description is provided to some classes of 
Type II string theories in non constant RR backgrounds.
This is done by applying the manifest (2,2) approach of Berkovits and Maldacena
to Type II strings and by studying the condition of exact conformal
invariance of certain supersymmetric backgrounds.
We find a new set of exact type IIA strings with non constant
RR 2-form and 4-form curvatures
and for type IIB with non constant 3-form curvature.
