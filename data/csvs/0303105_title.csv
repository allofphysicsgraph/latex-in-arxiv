\abstract{The present-day significance of Yang's quantized space-time algebra (YST) is pointed out from the holographic viewpoint. One finds that the D-dimensional YST and its modified version (MYST) have the background symmetry SO(D+1,1) and SO(D,2), which are well known to underlie the dS/CFT and AdS/CFT correspondences, respectively. This fact suggests a new possibility of dS/YST and AdS/MYST in parallel with dS/CFT and AdS/CFT, respectively. The spatial components of quantized space-time and momentum operators of YST have discrete eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and $1/R$, without contradiction to Lorentz-covariance. With respect to MYST, the spatial components of space-time operators and the time component (energy) of momentum operators have discrete eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and $1/R$, in contrast to YST. This discrete structure of YST and MYST, which CFT lacks entirely, may provide a theoretical ground for the unified regularization or cutoff of ultraviolet and infrared divergences familiar in the UV/IR connection in the holographic hypothesis.}

\chapter{Introduction}
In the previous paper\ref\Tanaka (referred to as I, hereafter), the present author attempted second quantization of the matrix model of $D_0$ branes, that is, quantum mechanics of $D_0$ branes proposed by  Banks, Fischer, Shenker and Susskind,\Ref\Bf\bfss\ by introducing second-quantized D field defined on quantized space-time early proposed by Snyder\ref\snyder and immediately after by Yang.\Ref\Y\yang
