Simulations in compact U(1) lattice gauge theory in 4D show now beyond any
reasonable doubts that the  
phase transition  separating the Coulomb from the
confined phase is of first order, albeit a very weak one. This settles
the issue from the numerical side. On the analytical side, it was
suggested some time ago, based on  the qualitative analogy between the 
phase diagram of such a  model and the one of scalar QED  obtained by 
soft breaking the $N=2$ Seiberg-Witten model down to $N=0$,
that the phase transition should be
of second order. In this work we take a fresh look at this issue and show that 
a proper implementation of the Seiberg-Witten model below the supersymmetry 
breaking scale requires considering some
new radiative corrections. Through 
the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism this turns the second order transition
into a weakly first order one, in agreement with the numerical
results. We comment on several other aspects of this continuum model.
