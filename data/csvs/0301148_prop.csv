Let $H^k(E)$ denote the $H^k$ sections of $E$. Let $V_n$ be a sequence of
finite
dimensional vector subspaces of $H^k(E)$ of constant dimension $p$
which converge to another $p$-dimensional subspace $V$ of $H^k(E)$,
in the following sense: there exists an $L^2$-orthonormal basis $e_1^n,
\ldots ,
e_p^n$ of $V_n$ and an $L^2$-orthonormal basis $e_1, \ldots , e_p$ of $V$ so
that for
each $i=1, \ldots p$, $e_i^n \rightarrow e_i$ in $H^k$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$.
Denote by $P_n$ and $P$ the $L^2$ orthogonal projections onto
$V_n^{\perp}$ and $V^{\perp}$ respectively. Then $P_n \rightarrow P$ in
the operator norm on $B(H^k(E),H^k(E))$, the bounded linear maps between
$H^k(E)$ and itself.
