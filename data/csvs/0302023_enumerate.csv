\item They are operators of higher dimension. This is related to the
fact that the brane coefficients are dimensionful and the theory is
nonrenormalizable.

\item The divergences are not pure numbers, but functions of $y$
localized at the branes, \ie, functions like $\del_0^2$. Notice that
also one loop 
corrections in an orbifold without brane terms require the
introduction of counterterms in a nontrivial background: the delta
functions at the fixed points.

\item The coefficients of these singular operators are determined (in
a given regularization) by
the requirement that the divergences must be cancelled. This is
analogous 
to the fact that the infinite parts of usual counterterms are 
fixed by the structure of the radiative corrections. However, in
our case there is no freedom to adjust at will the finite part of the
coefficients, as the operator itself is ``infinite''. This has a very
important consequence:

\item The coefficients of the higher dimensional operators with more
than one delta are not independent parameters of the effective
theory. They do not require new observables to be fixed by
experiment.
