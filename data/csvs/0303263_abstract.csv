The aim of this review is to present the list of by now a significant
collection of quantum integrable models, ultralocal as well as nonultralocal,
 in a systematic way stressing on their underlying unifying
 algebraic structures. We restrict  to quantum and statistical models
belonging to trigonometric and rational classes with
$2\times 2$ Lax operators. The ultralocal models  can be  classified
 successfully through their associated quantum algebra and are governed by
 the Yang-Baxter equation, while the nonultralocal models, the theory of
 which is still in the developmental stage, allow systematization through
 the braided Yang-Baxter equation. Along with the known integrable models
some  possible directions  for  investigation in this
field and generation of such new models  
  are suggested.
