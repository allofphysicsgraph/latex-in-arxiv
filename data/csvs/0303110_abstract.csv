Abstract : In this paper, we analyze the anisotropy of the scale
factor in the Kantowski-Sachs spacetime. We show that the
anisotropy will not increase when the expansion rate is greater
than certain values while it will increase when the expansion rate
is less than that value or the Universe is contracting. It is
manifested that the matter dominated and radiation dominated era
favor the flat spacetime if the anisotropy does not develop
significantly. The relation between the cosmological anisotropy
and the red-shift of the supernovae, which could be used to verify
the anisotropy through the observation, has been derived.
