\begin{abstract}
It was recently pointed out that the physics
of a single discrete gravitational extra dimension
exhibits a peculiar UV/IR connection relating 
the UV scale to the radius of the effective extra dimension.
Here we note that this non-locality is a manifestation 
of holography, encoding the correct scaling of the number
of fundamental degrees of freedom of the UV
theory. This in turn relates the Wilsonian
RG flow in the UV theory to the effective 
gravitational dynamics in the extra dimension.
The relevant holographic c-function is determined
by the expression for the holographic bound.
Holography in this context is a result of the requirements of 
unitarity and diffeomorphism invariance.
We comment on the relevance of this observation
for the cosmological constant problem.

\section{Introduction and relation to previous work}%:

Recently, we have argued that the vanishing of the vacuum energy
of $(2+1)$-dimensional gravity \cite{wittencc,Hen,wittencc2,bbs}
may be deconstructed \cite{nima} to $3+1$ dimensions under certain
conditions \cite{ljm}. Our discussion pointed
towards a possibility that there exists a well-defined UV completion 
of $(3+1)$-dimensional gravity. (For related discussions, see 
Refs.\ \cite{others} and \cite{harvard}.)

More recently it was pointed out by
Arkani-Hamed and Schwartz \cite{nimas} that
the physics of gravitational deconstruction
exhibits a fascinating relation between
the characteristic UV and IR scales.
This UV/IR relation was argued \cite{nimas}
to indicate the presence of non-local interactions
in the defining UV theory.

Here, we point out that the UV/IR relation
found in Ref.\ \cite{nimas} is nothing but a manifestation
of the holographic principle \cite{holography,holography1,bhent}.
In particular the specific form of the UV/IR correspondence
found in the problem of deconstruction of gravity
is very analogous to a similar relation
found \cite{susswitt} in a seemingly completely unrelated 
topic - the AdS/CFT correspondence \cite{adscft} (see also \cite{stromds})!


As reviewed in Ref.\ \cite{ljm},
in $(2+1)$-dimensional theories it is possible \cite{wittencc} to have 
vanishing vacuum energy in the absence of a mass degenerate spectrum
of bosonic and fermionic states. The basic point is that
the vacuum state is supersymmetric, 
but the excited states are not mass degenerate because unbroken 
global supercharges do not exist in $2+1$ dimensions \cite{Hen}. 
Any excited state gives a conical geometry whose deficit angle
prohibits spinor fields with covariantly constant asymptotics.  Thus,
there are no global supercharges and no mass degeneracy between Bose
and Fermi excitations.  The size of the non-degeneracy
of the spectrum of low-energy excitations scales as the inverse power
of the three-dimensional Newton constant under the assumption of weak
gravitational coupling \cite{wittencc2}.


The idea behind deconstruction \cite{nima} is that the UV region of a 
theory might
be described in terms of a co-dimension one theory.
Motivated by this idea in Ref.\ \cite{ljm} we argued that 
the $(2+1)$-dimensional phenomenon 
described above can be deconstructed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item (1) Assume a local spatial foliation of 4d spacetime.

\item (2) Deconstruct the vacuum part of pure 4d gravity from 
($N$ copies of) 3d general relativity \cite{wittencs}
coupled to certain 3d 
matter fields represented in terms of currents. Assume that the 4d 
sources can be defined in terms of a deconstructed 3d 
theory. 
For sources represented by gauge fields this should be possible 
given the discussion in Ref.\ \cite{ljm}.

\item (3) In the deep UV we have ($N$ copies of) 3d gravity coupled to some
3d sources.  Whatever the matter content of this
3d theory is, the resulting geometry has to
be conical.  Thus, provided we have 3d (but not 4d!) supersymmetry, 
Witten's argument applies: the vacuum is supersymmetric,
yet the excited states are not.

\item (4) In the range of intermediate scales, we have $N$ linked copies
of 3d gravity coupled to 3d currents. Once again, the resulting 3d 
geometry is conical. Thus Witten's argument holds in
the region between the UV and IR.
\end{itemize}

Note that on dimensional grounds, 
the mass splitting should be 
inversely proportional to the three-dimensional Newton constant and 
should vanish at zero deficit angle.%; e.g., one may take 
%$\Delta m \simeq \delta/G_N$.
%(Here in principle we can have a function of $\delta$ which is
%Taylor expandable. %By demanding that
%$\Delta m \to 0$ as $\delta \to 0$ to lowest order one gets $\delta$.)
Thus as long as the three-dimensional Newton constant
is of order one as the continuum limit is taken,
and the deficit angle (on each local three-dimensional
slice) is taken to scale as the inverse of the lattice spacing,
the Bose-Fermi splitting will be finite in the infrared.
%These remarks may be tested by
%examination of the example of Ref.\ \cite{bbs}.}"
