\item The spectrum of the kinetic term is identical to the conventional open
string at large $N$. That is, the propagator in perturbation theory is
identical in both theories.

\item The Neumann coefficients of the oscillator formalism were computed
directly from the Moyal product \cite{BM2}\cite{PREP}, and these were shown
to satisfy the Gross-Jevicki nonlinear relations \cite{GJ} for any
frequencies $\kappa _{n}$. Their simple expression explains as well agrees
with spectroscopy \cite{spectroscopy}, and agree numerically with other
computations at large $N$.
