Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) is a class of theories of
relativistic motion with two observer-independent scales. We
investigate the velocity of particles in DSR, defining velocity as
the Poisson bracket of position with the appropriate hamiltonian,
taking care of the non-trivial structure of the DSR phase space.
We find the general expression for four-velocity, and  we show
further that the three-velocity of massless particles equals 1 for
all DSR theories. The relation between the boost parameter and
velocity is also clarified.
