These lectures provide an introduction to the subject of tachyon
condensation in the open bosonic string.  The problem of tachyon
condensation is first described in the context of the low-energy
Yang-Mills description of a system of multiple D-branes, and then
using the language of string field theory.  An introduction is given
to Witten's cubic open bosonic string field theory.  The Sen
conjectures on tachyon condensation in open bosonic string field
theory are introduced, and evidence confirming these conjectures is
reviewed.
