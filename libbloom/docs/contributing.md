Contributing
============

Thanks for trying out libbloom! If you'd like to let me know how it
worked for you, please do!

Bugs or Enhancements
--------------------

Feel free to open a github
[issue](https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom/issues) if you run into any
bug or if you'd like to suggest a feature or enhancement. Try to be as
specific as possible in the description.

Pull requests
-------------

For small and/or obvious changes, feel free to submit a github pull
request.

For anything larger than that, please first file an
[issue](https://github.com/jvirkki/libbloom/issues)
describing the proposal.

Please submit pull requests against the 'development' branch, not master.

Note that libbloom has been adopted in many distributions, so at this
point source and binary compatibility is valuable. For any potentially
incompatible change, please file an issue for discussion first.
