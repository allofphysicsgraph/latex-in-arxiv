For models with several time-dependent components generalized
entropies can be defined. This is shown for the Bianchi type IX model.
We first derive the Cardy-Verlinde formula
under the assumption that the first law of thermodynamics is valid.
This leads to an explicit expression of the total entropy associated
with this type of universes. Assuming
the validity of the Cardy entropy
formula, we obtain expressions for the corresponding
Bekenstein, Bekenstein-Hawking
and Hubble entropies. We  discuss
the validity of the Cardy-Verlinde formula and possible
extensions of the outlined procedure
to other time-dependent models.
