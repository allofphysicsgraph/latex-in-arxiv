We study time dependent solutions in cubic open string field theory
which is expected to describe the configuration of the rolling
tachyon.
We consider the truncated system consisting of component fields
of level zero and two, which are expanded in terms of $\cosh n x^0$
modes.
For studying the large time behavior of the solution we need to know
the coefficients of all and, in particular, large $n$ modes.
We examine numerically the coefficients of the $n$-th mode, and find
that it has the leading $n$-dependence of the form
$(-\beta)^n\,\lambda^{-n^2}$ multiplied by a peculiar subleading part
with peaks at $n=2^m=4,8,16,32,64,128,\cdots$.
This behavior is also reproduced analytically
by solving simplified equations of motion of the tachyon system.
