The most fruitful approach to studying low energy soliton dynamics in field
theories of Bogomol'nyi type is the geodesic approximation of Manton. In the
case of vortices and monopoles, Stuart has obtained rigorous estimates
of the errors in this approximation, and hence proved that it is valid in the
low speed regime. His method employs energy estimates which rely on a key
coercivity property of the Hessian of the energy functional of the theory
under consideration. In this paper we prove an analogous coercivity property
for the Hessian of the energy functional of a general sigma model with
compact K\""ahler domain and target. We go on to prove a continuity property
for
our result, and show that, for the ${\mathbb{C}}{{P}}^1$ model on $S^2$, the Hessian
fails to be globally coercive in the degree $1$ sector. We present numerical
evidence which suggests that the Hessian is globally coercive in a certain
equivariance class of the degree $n$ sector for $n\geq 2$. We also prove
that, within the geodesic approximation, a single ${\mathbb{C}}{{P}}^1$ lump moving on
$S^2$ does not generically travel on a great circle.
