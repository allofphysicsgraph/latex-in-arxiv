Using the Schwarzschild-type coordinates in stead of the global ones we
reconstruct the classical rotating closed string solutions in the 
$AdS_5\times S^5$ backgrounds. They are explicitly described by the 
Jacobi elliptic and trigonometrical functions of worldsheet coordinates.
We study the orbiting closed string configurations in the near-horizon 
geometries of D$p$, NS1 and NS5 branes, and derive the energy and spin
of them, whose relation takes a simple form for short strings.
Specially in the D5 and NS5 backgrounds we have a linear relation that
the energy of the point-like string is proportional to the spin,
which is associated with the spectrum of strings in the pp-wave geometries
obtained by taking a special Penrose limit on the D5 and NS5 backgrounds.
