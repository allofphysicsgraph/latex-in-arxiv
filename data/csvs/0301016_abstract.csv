The symmetry algebra of massless fields living on the
3-dimensional conformal boundary of $AdS_4$ is shown to be
isomorphic to $3d$ conformal higher spin algebra ($AdS_4$ higher
spin algebra). A simple realization of this algebra on the free
flat $3d$ massless matter fields is given in terms of an auxiliary
Fock module.
