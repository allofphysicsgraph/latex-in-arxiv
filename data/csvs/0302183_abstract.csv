	Quantum field theory in the near-horizon region of a black hole
predicts the existence of an infinite number of degenerate modes. Such a
degeneracy is regulated in the brick wall model by the introduction of a
short distance cutoff. In this Letter we show that states of the brick
wall model with non zero energy admit a further degeneracy for any given
finite value of the cutoff. The black hole entropy is calculated within the
brick wall model taking this degeneracy into account. Modes with complex
frequencies however do not exhibit such a degeneracy.
