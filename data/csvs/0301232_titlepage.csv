{\bf Abstract}
\end{center}

We consider compactification of the $SO(32)$
heterotic string on a 6-dimensional $Z_3$
orbifold with one discrete Wilson line.
A complete set of all possible embeddings is given.
The unbroken subgroups of $SO(32)$ are tabulated.
The extended gauge symmetry $SU(3)^3$, recently
discussed by J.~E.~Kim [hep-th/0301177] for semi-realistic
$E_8 \ti E_8$ heterotic string models,
occurs for several embeddings,
as well as other groups that may be of interest
in unified string models.
The extent to which extra gauge
group factors can be hidden is discussed and
compared to the $E_8 \ti E_8$ case.
Along flat directions where an effective
hidden sector exists, the embeddings described here provide
for hidden gauge groups that are
not possible in the $E_8 \ti E_8$ heterotic string.
