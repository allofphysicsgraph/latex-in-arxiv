On the basis of the Berkovits pure spinor formalism of
covariant quantization of supermembrane, we attempt to
construct a M(atrix) theory which is covariant under $SO(1,10)$
Lorentz group. We first construct a bosonic M(atrix) theory
by starting with the first-order formalism of bosonic
membrane, which precisely gives us a bosonic sector of 
M(atrix) theory by BFSS. Next we generalize this method to the 
construction of M(atrix) theory of supermembranes.  
However, it seems to be difficult to obtain a covariant and 
supersymmetric M(atrix) theory from the Berkovits pure spinor 
formalism of supermembrane because of the matrix character of 
the BRST symmetry. Instead, in this paper, we construct a 
supersymmetric and covariant matrix model of 11D superparticle,
which corresponds to a particle limit of covariant M(atrix) theory.
By an explicit calculation, we show that the one-loop effective
potential is trivial, thereby implying that this matrix model
is a free theory at least at the one-loop level.
