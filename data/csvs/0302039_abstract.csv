Analytical approximations for ${\langle \varphi^2 \rangle}$ and
${\langle T^{\mu}_{\nu} \rangle}$ of a quantized scalar field in
static spherically symmetric spacetimes are obtained. The field is
assumed to be both massive and massless, with an arbitrary
coupling $\xi$ to the scalar curvature, and in a zero temperature
vacuum state.  The expressions for ${\langle \varphi^2 \rangle}$
and ${\langle T^{\mu}_{\nu} \rangle}$ are divided into low- and
high-frequency parts. The contributions of the high-frequency
modes to these quantities are calculated for an arbitrary quantum
state. As an example, the low-frequency contributions to ${\langle
\varphi^2 \rangle}$ and ${\langle T^{\mu}_{\nu} \rangle}$ are
calculated in asymptotically flat spacetimes in a quantum state
corresponding to the Minkowski vacuum (Boulware quantum state).
The limits of the applicability of these approximations are
discussed.
