Motivated by some recent speculative  attempts to model the dark energy,
scalar fields with negative kinetic energy coupled to gravity
without a cosmological
constant are considered. It is shown that in the presence of
 an ordinary  fluid, any solution of the vacuum Einstein
equations with
cosmological constant is a solution provided
$\rho-P={\Lambda \over 4
  \pi G}$. The solutions can be interpreted as a steady state
in which matter or entropy is being continuously created (or
destroyed). The motion of the matter is not determined
by the background Einstein spacetime, many different matter flows
can be found giving rise to the same metric.
 Solutions without ordinary matter are also considered.
Anti-gravitating multi-solutions and
repulsive solutions which can chase
ordinary matter or black holes are exhibited.
These results may also have applications to
 gravity theories with higher derivatives.
