Recently it was observed that the hyperbolic compactification of
M/string theory related to S-branes may lead to a transient period of
acceleration of the universe.   
We study  time evolution of the corresponding effective 4d
cosmological model supplemented by cold dark matter 
and show that it is marginally possible to describe observational data
for the late-time cosmic acceleration in this model.  
However, investigation  of the compactification $11d \to 4d$ suggests
that the Compton wavelengths  of the KK modes in this model are of the
same order as the size of the observable part of the universe.  
Assuming that this problem, as well as several other problems of this
scenario, can be resolved,  
we propose a possible solution of the cosmological coincidence problem
due to relation between the dark energy density and the effective
dimensionality of the universe.
