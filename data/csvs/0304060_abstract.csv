In this paper it is shown that the entropy of the black hole
horizon in the Ach\'ucarro-Ortiz  spacetime, which is the most
general two-dimensional black hole derived from the
three-dimensional rotating BTZ black hole, can be described by the
Cardy-Verlinde formula. The latter is supposed to be an entropy
formula of conformal field theory in any dimension.
