Symmetry breaking can produce ``Alice'' strings, which alter scattered
charges and carry monopole number and charge when twisted into loops.
Alice behavior arises algebraically, when a string's untraced Wilson
loop obstructs unbroken symmetries --- a fragile criterion. We give a
topological criterion, compelling Alice behavior or deforming it
away. Our criterion, that $\pi_o(H)$ acts nontrivially on $\pi_1(H)$,
links topological Alice strings to topological monopoles. We twist
Alice loops to form monopoles, and find nematic and $^3$He-A Alice
strings are topological, carrying fundamental monopole charge when
twisted into loops.
