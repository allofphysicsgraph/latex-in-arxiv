The Dirichlet boundary-value problem and isoperimetric inequalities
for positive definite regular solutions of the vacuum Einstein
equations are studied in arbitrary dimensions for the class of metrics
with boundaries admitting a $U(1)$ action.  In the case of trivial
bundles, apart from the flat space solution with periodic
identification, such solutions include the Euclideanised Schwarzschild
metrics with an arbitrary compact Einstein-manifold as the base,
whereas for non-trivial bundles the regular solutions include the
Taub-Nut metric with a $\bbbc P^n$ base and the Taub-Bolt and the
Euguchi-Hanson metrics with an arbitrary Einstein-K\""ahler base.  We
show that in the case of non-trivial bundles Taub-Bolt infillings are
double-valued whereas Taub-Nut and Eguchi-Hanson infillings are
unique. In the case of trivial bundles, there are two Schwarzschild
infillings in arbitrary dimensions. The condition of whether a
particular type of filling in is possible can be expressed as a
limitation on squashing through a functional dependence on dimension
in each case. The case of the Eguchi-Hanson metric is solved in
arbitrary dimension. The Taub-Nut and the Taub-Bolt are solved in four
dimensions and methods for arbitrary dimension are delineated. For the
case of Schwarzschild, analytic formulae for the two infilling black
hole masses in arbitrary dimension have been obtained. This should
facilitate the study of black hole dynamics/thermodynamics in higher
dimensions. We found that all infilling solutions are convex. Thus
convexity of the boundary does not guarantee uniqueness of the
infilling. Isoperimetric inequalities involving the volume of the
boundary and the volume of the infilling solutions are then
investigated. In particular, the analogues of Minkowski's celebrated
inequality in flat space are found and discussed providing insight
into the geometric nature of these Ricci-flat spaces.
