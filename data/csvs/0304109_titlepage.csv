\begin{small}
Unified $\ensuremath{\mathcal{N}}=2$   Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories (MESGTs)
are supergravity theories in which all the vector fields, including
the graviphoton,
transform in an irreducible representation of a simple global
symmetry group of the
 Lagrangian.
As was established long time ago, in five dimensions there exist only four
unified Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories
whose target manifolds are symmetric spaces.
These theories are defined by
the four simple Euclidean Jordan algebras of degree three.
In this paper, we show that, in addition to these four
unified MESGTs with symmetric target spaces, there exist
three infinite families of unified MESGTs as well as
 another exceptional one. These novel unified  MESGTs are
 defined by non-compact (Minkowskian) Jordan algebras, and
 their target spaces
are in general neither symmetric nor homogeneous. The members of
one of these three infinite
families can be gauged in such a way as to obtain an infinite family of
{\it unified} $\ensuremath{\mathcal{N}}=2$ Yang-Mills-Einstein supergravity theories, in which all
vector fields transform in the adjoint representation of a simple
 gauge group of the
type $SU(N,1)$.
The corresponding gaugings in the other two infinite families lead to
Yang-Mills-Einstein supergravity theories coupled to tensor
multiplets.
