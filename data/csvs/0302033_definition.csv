\textbf{Regularity conditions (RCs)}: The constraints $\phi ^{r}\approx 0$
are regular if and only if their small variations $\delta \phi ^{r}\ $%
evaluated on $\Sigma $ define $R$ linearly independent functions of $\delta
z^{i}$.

\textbf{Equivalence}: Different sets of constraints are said to be
equivalent if they define the same constraint surface.
