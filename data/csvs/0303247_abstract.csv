Starting from an anomaly-free Abelian Higgs model coupled to gravity
in a 6-dimensional space-time we construct an effective
four-dimensional theory of charged fermions interacting with U(1)
Abelian gauge field and gravity, both localised near the core of a
Nielsen-Olesen vortex configuration. We show that an anomaly free
theory in 6-dimensions can give rise to an anomalous  theory in D=4,
which suggests a possibility of consistent regularisation of abelian
anomalous chiral gauge theories in four dimensions. We also show that
the spectrum of charged bulk fermions has a mass gap.
