\item In case where one has serious doubts about the theory of cosmological perturbations at
$t \to - \infty$ it looks reasonable to assign ``initial"" quantum fluctuation on a NPH 
to the future of which the standard procedure applies.
\item Although there are ambiguities in defining the Hamiltonian in 
time-dependent problems, physical results do not depend on the choice of such Hamiltonian.
 Corrections to the standard result only depend on the choice of the `` initial"" state on the NPH.
\item An attractive, though by no means unique, choice for the initial state is the one
 that minimized the Hamiltonian on the NPH. The so-defined state {\em does depend} on how the Hamiltonian
to be minimized is chosen.
\item The size of transplanckian corrections is a sensitive function of 
that choice with the most  ``adiabatic"" Hamiltonians giving the smallest corrections in terms of the
small parameter $H_{\rm ex}^{\rm NPH} / \Lambda$. The  most adiabatic Hamiltonian, 
whose minimization on a space-like hypersurface leads to correlation functions of the Hadamard form,
gives transplanckian corrections that are much smaller than previously suggested.
\item A final answer to the question of transplanckian corrections will only be found 
when a theory of transplanckian physics is defined, \dots and solved.
