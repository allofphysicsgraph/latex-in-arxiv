\item There exists a \emph{classical limit}. The classical description
    is not so bad for a wide range of energies, distances, momenta
    etc.
\item To any classical observable there corresponds a quantum
    observable. There can not be more classical observables as the
    fundamental description is quantum and classical observables only
    arise as classical limits of quantum observables. On the other
    hand, if there are more quantum observables not having a
    reasonable classical limit then `quantization' is hopeless for
    such a system.
\item Classical \emph{Poisson brackets} should correspond to quantum
    commutators of the corresponding observables.

    `quantizations'.

\item $\overline{{\{f, g\}}} = \{\overline{{f}}, \overline{{g}}\}$ (Reality).
\item $\{f,g\} = - \{g,f\}$ (Antisymmetry).
\item $\{f, gh\} = \{f,g\}h + g \{f,h\}$ (Leibniz rule).
\item $\{f, \{g,h\}\} = \{\{f,g\},h\} + \{g, \{f,h\}\}$ 
      (Jacobi identity).

\item $(\mathbbm{R}^{2n}, \omega)$ is the well-known phase
    space from classical mechanics.
\item $\mathfrak{g}^*$ with the above Poisson structure always plays a
    role for systems with symmetries described by $\mathfrak{g}$.
\item The phase space of the rigid body is $SO(3) \times
    \mathbbm{R}^3$. More generally, cotangent bundles $T^*Q$ describe
    the phase space of a particle moving in the configuration space
    $Q$. There is a canonical symplectic structure on $T^*Q$.
\item For physical systems with constraints, in particular if there are
    gauge degrees of freedom, the \emph{reduced phase space} typically
    has a very complicated Poisson structure.

\item \emph{Standard ordering}: $\varrho_{{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{S}}}(q^np^m) = Q^nP^m$.
\item \emph{Weyl ordering}: $\varrho_{{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{Weyl}}}(q^n p^m)$ is the corresponding
    totally symmetrized polynomial in $Q$ and $P$, e.g.
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:WeylExample}
        \varrho_{{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{Weyl}}}(qp^2) = \frac{1}{3}(QP^2 + QPQ + PQ^2).
