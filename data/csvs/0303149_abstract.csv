in quantum Liouville theory and the quantization of 
Teichm\""uller spaces as developed by Kashaev, Checkov and Fock.
In both cases one assigns to a Riemann surface 
a Hilbert space acted on by a representation of the
mapping class group. According to a conjecture of H. Verlinde,
the two are equivalent. We describe some key steps in the
verification of this conjecture.
