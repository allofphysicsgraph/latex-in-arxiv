In this paper, we show that the propagator of the dual of a general Proca-like theory,
derived from the gauging iterative Noether Dualization Method, can be written by means
of a simple relation between known propagators. This result is also a 
demonstration that the Lagrangian obtained by dualization describes the same physical 
particles as the ones present in the original theory 
 at the expense of introducing 
new non-physical (ghosts) excitations.
