\centerline{\large\bf Abstract}

We study solutions of Einstein's equations corresponding
codimension $n>2$
global topological defects with de Sitter slices.
We analyze a class of solutions that are
cylindrically symmetric and admit
positive, negative or zero {\textit{Bulk}} cosmological constant.
We derive the relevant graviton equations.
For an extended brane, the properties of the solution depend on
appropriate boundary conditions that the exterior solutions have to
satisfy near the core. As an alternative we consider matching copies of
the exterior solution related by symmetry. We show that we can get
localization only when the {\textit{Bulk}} cosmological constant is negative. We
obtain a condition on the global defect symmetry breaking scale which
ultimately controls the size of the $n-1$ internal dimensions at the
position of the brane. The induced metric on the brane, in the case of
mirror spacetimes, is a direct product of a de Sitter space and an
$(n-1)$-sphere, while the metric of the embedding spacetime is a warped
product and the actual size of the $(n-1)$-sphere changes as we move
along the radial direction. The solutions possess naked singularities,
which nevertheless satisfy no-flow conditions.
