In this work, we present the gravitational field generated by a cosmic string
carrying a timelike current in the scalar-tensor gravities. The
mechanism of formation and evolution of wakes is fully investigated in
this framework. We show explicitly that the inclusion of electromagnetic
properties for the string induces logarithmic divergences in the accretion
problem.
