We quantise complex, infinite--dimensional projective space ${\bf CP}({\cal H})$.
We apply the result to quantise a complex, finite--dimensional, classical phase space 
${\cal C}$ whose symplectic volume is infinite, by holomorphically embedding it into 
${\bf CP}({\cal H})$. The embedding is univocally determined by requiring it to be an isometry 
between the Bergman metric on ${\cal C}$ and the Fubiny--Study metric on ${\bf CP}({\cal H})$.
Then the Hilbert--space bundle over ${\cal C}$ is the pullback, by the 
embedding, of the Hilbert--space bundle over ${\bf CP}({\cal H})$. 

Keywords: Quantum mechanics, infinite--dimensional projective space, holomorphic vector bundles.
