In this comment on the recently published
paper ```Global monopole in Asymptotically dS/ AdS Spacetime'' [Phys. Rev. {\bf
D 66} (2002), 107701], we reconsider global monopoles in asymptotic de Sitter/ Anti- de Sitter
space-time. In comparison to the mentioned publication, we find that the introduction
of a cosmological constant can {\bf not} render a positive
mass of the global monopole. Moreover, we find (confirmed by our numerical
analysis) a different asymptotic behaviour of the metric functions.
