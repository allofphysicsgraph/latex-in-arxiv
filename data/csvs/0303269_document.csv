  Brane inflation in superstring theory predicts that cosmic strings 
  (but not domain walls or monopoles) are produced towards the end 
  of the   inflationary epoch. Here, we discuss the production, the
  spectrum and the evolution of such cosmic strings, properties
  that differentiate them from those coming from an abelian Higgs
  model. As D-branes in extra dimensions, some type of cosmic 
  strings will dissolve rapidly in spacetime, while the stable 
  ones appear with a spectrum of cosmic string tensions. Moreover, 
  the presence of the extra dimensions reduces the interaction 
  rate of the cosmic strings in some scenarios, resulting 
  in an order of magnitude enhancement of the number/energy density 
  of the cosmic string network when compared to the field theory case.

\section{Introduction}

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) data \cite{cobe,new} strongly
 supports the inflationary universe scenario \cite{guth} to be the
explanation of the origin of the big bang. However, the origin of
the inflaton and its potential is not well understood---a paradigm
in search of a model.

Recently, the brane world scenario suggested by superstring theory
was proposed, where the standard model of the strong and electroweak
interactions are open string (brane) modes while the graviton and the
radions are closed string (bulk) modes.
In a generic brane world scenario, there are three types of light 
scalar modes : (1) bulk modes like radions (\emph{i.e.}~the
sizes/shape of the compactified dimensions) and the dilaton
(\emph{i.e.}~the coupling), (2) brane positions (or relative positions)
and (3) tachyonic modes which are present on non-BPS branes or branes
that are not BPS relative to each other \cite{Sen:1999mg}.  In
general, the bulk modes have gravitational strength couplings (so too
weak to reheat the universe at the end of inflation) and so are not
good inflaton candidates. Neither are the tachyonic modes, which roll
down the potential too fast for inflation. This leaves the relative
brane positions (\emph{i.e.}~brane separation) as candidates for
inflation.  So, natural in the brane world is the brane inflation
scenario \cite{Dvali:1998pa}, in which the inflaton is an open string mode
identified with an inter-brane separation, while the inflaton
potential emerges from the exchange of closed string modes between
branes; the latter is the dual of the one-loop partition function of
the open string spectrum, a property well-studied in string theory 
This interaction is gravitational strength,
resulting in a very weak (that is, relatively flat) potential, ideally
tailored for inflation.

The scenario is simplest when the radion and the dilaton (bulk) modes
are assumed to be stabilized by some unknown non-perturbative bulk
dynamics at the onset of inflation.  Since the inflaton is a brane
mode, and the inflaton potential is dictated by the brane mode
spectrum, it is reasonable to assume that the inflaton potential is
insensitive to the details of the bulk dynamics.

Brane inflation has been shown to be very robust (see 
\emph{e.g.}~\cite{Burgess:2001fx,Garcia-Bellido:2001ky,Jones:2002cv,
Quevedo:2002xw}).
The inflaton potential is essentially dictated by the gravitational
attractive (and the Ramond-Ramond) interaction between
branes.  As the branes move towards each other, slow-roll inflation 
takes place. This yields an almost scale-invariant power spectrum for
the density perturbation. As they reach a distance around the string 
scale, the inflaton potential becomes relatively steep so that the 
slow-roll condition breaks down. Inflation ends when branes collide 
and heat the universe \cite{stw}, which is the origin of the big bang.
Towards the end of the brane inflationary epoch in the brane world,
tachyon fields appear. As a tachyon rolls down its potential,
defects are formed (see \emph{e.g.}~\cite{Alexander:2001ks}). Due to
properties of the superstring theory and the cosmological conditions, 
only cosmic strings (but not domain walls or monopoles) are
copiously produced during the brane collision \cite{Jones:2002cv,
Sarangi:2002yt}. These cosmic strings are Dp-branes with (p-1)
dimensions compactified.  The CMB radiation
data fixes the superstring scale to be close to the grand
unified (GUT) scale, which then determines the cosmic string tensions,
which turn out to have values that are compatible with today's
observation, but may be tested in the near future.

In field theory, one may also devise an abelian Higgs like model 
around the GUT scale to produce cosmic strings towards the end of 
inflation in which the cosmic string tension is essentially a free 
parameter. Although such a model may not be as well motivated as 
brane inflation, it is a possibility, so we aim to find signatures
that distinguish cosmic strings in brane inflation from those coming
from an abelian Higgs model.

In this paper, we explore more closely the production of 
cosmic strings after inflation, the properties of the cosmic strings, 
in particular their tensions and stability, and finally their evolution
to an eventual network. In summary, we find that the final outcome 
depends crucially on the quantitative details of a particular 
brane inflationary scenario being contemplated. 
In some scenarios, the cosmic strings produced 
via the Kibble mechanism may dissolve quickly. It is likely that 
their dissolution (which can happen soon after (re)heating) leads to 
the thermal production of lower-dimensional branes as cosmic strings. 
This is very likely if the (re)heating process is efficient \cite{stw},
since the (re)heat temperature is comparable to the superstring scale. 
In other scenarios, they will evolve to a cosmic string network. 
In this case,
the general properties of the resulting cosmic string network is 
likely to be quite different from that arising from field theory.
The cosmic strings appear as defects of the tachyon condensation and
can be D1 branes or Dp-branes wrapping a (p-1)-dimensional compact
manifold. They yield a spectrum of cosmic string tensions
including Kaluza-Klein modes. Moreover, due to the presence of
the compactified dimensions the interaction rate of the cosmic
strings in some scenarios decreases, and when compared to the case in
ordinary field theory, the result is an increase by orders of
magnitude in the number density of the cosmic string network in our
universe.

\section{A Variety of Brane Inflationary Scenarios}

The brane inflationary scenarios we are interested in have
the string scale close to the GUT scale so we consider only brane
world models which are supersymmetric (post-inflation) at the GUT 
scale. (Supersymmetry is expected to be broken at the TeV scale, 
which is negligible for the physics we are interested in here.)
In the 10-dimensional
superstring theory, the cosmic strings in our 4-dimensional spacetime
shall be D-branes with one spatial dimension lying along the 3 large
spatial dimensions representing our universe. Hence we seek to
enumerate the possible stable configurations of branes of different
dimensionality in 10 dimensions, compactified on a six manifold.  To
be specific, let us consider a typical Type IIB orientifold model 
compactified on $(T^2\times T^2\times T^2)/\mathbbm{Z}_N$ or some 
of its variations (see for instance \cite{Gimon:1996rq}).
The model has $\mathcal N=1$ spacetime supersymmetry.  Although we
shall focus the discussion on Type IIB orientifolds, the underlying
picture is clearly more general.  We seek to categorize stable
configurations of branes which remain after inflation, and give rise
to stable cosmic strings in the universe.  By ``stable'' we mean that
some fraction of the cosmic strings produced is required to persist until
at least the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis in order for observable
effects to be generated.

In supersymmetric Type IIB string theory with branes and orientifold
planes, it is well known that only odd (spacial) dimensional
branes are stable.  The conditions for stable
brane configurations are simple given the  compactification manifold;
branes must differ by only 0, 4 or 8 in dimension, and branes of the
same dimension can be angled at right angles in two orthogonal
directions \cite{Berkooz:1996km, Lifschytz:1996iq}. In the generic 
case where the second homotopy class of the compactification manifold 
is $\pi_2 = \mathbbm Z^3$, branes will be stable when wrapping 
2-cycles in the compact manifold.  From these conditions, we formulate
Table~\ref{stable_table} of branes from which we shall build models of
post-inflation cosmology.

\end{table}\end{center}

In cosmological situations, branes which are non-BPS relative to the
others can be present.  Generally the non-BPS configurations will
decay, and the decay products of many are well known.  For instance a
Dp-D(p-2) brane combination will form a bound state of a Dp
brane with an appropriate amount of ``magnetic'' flux \cite{Gava:1997jt}.
This process is best understood as the delocalisation or ``smearing
out'' of the D(p-2) brane within the Dp brane. This process in the
Dp-D(p-2) brane system is described by the presence of a tachyon field,
an open string that stretches between them. This tachyon
condenses as the D(p-2) brane decays and
leads to a singular ``magnetic'' flux on the Dp brane; this ``magnetic''
flux then spreads out across the Dp brane and diminishes, leaving
the total flux conserved.  In an uncompactified theory, the residual
``magnetic'' field strength then vanishes. 
Since the tachyon in the Dp-D(p-2) brane combination is a complex 
scalar field inside the D(p-2) brane world volume, its 
rolling/condensation allows the formation of D(p-4)-branes as defects.
(The actual formation/production of D(p-4)-branes may require the 
dissolution of a D(p-2)-\Dbar(p-2) pair inside the Dp-brane.)

Another important set of non-BPS brane configurations which will be
generated in early universe brane-world cosmology are branes of the
same dimension oriented at general angles, which will also decay into
branes with magnetic flux, as described above.  There are also special
cases of non-BPS configurations which will not decay; between a D3$_3$
and D5$_1$ brane (or its T-dual equivalents, for instance a D1 and D7
brane) there is a repulsive force as seen in the total interbrane
potential, which includes all gravitational and RR forces, between a
Dp and a Dp$^\prime$-brane (p$^\prime <$p) (in terms of the separation
distance $r$ when $r\gg M_s^{-1}$)
\be
\label{vpot}
V(r) \sim -\frac{4-(p-p^\prime + 2a)}{r^{p-7+a}},
\ee
where $a$ is the number of directions in which the branes are
orthogonal \cite{Lifschytz:1996iq}.  This potential also makes clear
that there is no force between the BPS configurations of branes
described above - those which differ in dimension by 4 and those of
the same dimension which are angled in two orthogonal directions.

Brane world models of inflation require brane anti-brane pairs 
(or branes oriented at non-BPS angles) \cite{Burgess:2001fx,
Garcia-Bellido:2001ky,Jones:2002cv,Quevedo:2002xw}; the inflaton
field is described by the separation between the branes, and its
potential can be organized to give slow roll inflation.  To describe
the Standard Model, we demand a chiral post-inflation brane-world,
which requires that the branes which form our universe are angled in
some dimension; sets of D5$_1$ and D5$_2$ branes will give a stable
chiral low energy effective theory, for instance.

After the compactification to 4-dimensional spacetime, the Planck mass
$M_P= (8 \pi G)^{-1/2} = 2.4 \times 10^{18}$ GeV is given by
\be
\label{mp}
g_s^2 M_P^2 = M_s^2(M_sr_1)^2(M_sr_2)^2(M_sr_3)^2/\pi
\ee 
where $M_s$ is the superstring scale and
the compactification volumes (of the (45)-, (67)- and (89)-directions)
are $V_i=l_i^2 = (2 \pi r_i)^2$ for $i=$ 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
Here, $M_sr_i \ge $1.
The string coupling $g_s$ should be large enough for 
non-perturbative dynamics to stabilize the radion and the dilaton 
modes (but not too large that a dual version of the model has a weak
coupling). We expect the string coupling generically to be
$g_s {\ \lower-1.2pt\vbox{\hbox{\rlap{$>$}\lower5pt\vbox{\hbox{$\sim$}}}}\
}1$. 
To obtain a theory with a weakly coupled sector in the low energy
effective field theory (\emph{i.e.}~the standard model of strong and
electroweak 
interactions with weak gauge coupling constant), it then seems
necessary to have the brane world picture \cite{Kakushadze:1998wp}.
Suppose the D5$_1$-branes contain the standard model open string 
modes, then
\be
\label{gutg}
g_s \simeq \alpha_{\text{GUT}} (M_sr_1)^2
\ee
where $\alpha_{\text{GUT}} \simeq 1/25$ is the standard model coupling at 
the GUT scale, which is close to the superstring scale $M_s$. 
This implies that $(M_sr_1)^2 \sim$ 30. 
If some standard model modes come from 
D5$_2$-branes, or from open strings stretching between D5$_1$- and 
D5$_2$-branes, then $(M_sr_2)^2 \sim$ 30.

In the early universe, additional branes (and anti-branes) may be
present. Additional branes must come in pairs of brane-anti-brane
(or at angles), so that the total (conserved) RR charge in the 
compactified volume remains zero. Any even dimensional D-branes 
are non-BPS and so decay rapidly. 
The Hubble constant during inflation is roughly
\be 
\label{hubblec}
H^2 \simeq M_s^4/M_P^2
\ee

In Table~\ref{inflatons}, we
catalogue the various brane anti-brane pairs (provided that they 
are separated far enough apart) which can inflate the 4
dimensional Minkowski brane world volume of D5$_1$- and D5$_2$-branes. 
Towards the end of inflation, a tachyon field appears and its
rolling allows the production of defects.  \emph{A priori}, the 
defects (only cosmic strings here) which are allowable under the 
rules of K-theory \cite{Witten:1998cd} may be produced immediately 
after inflation, when the tachyon field starts rolling down.  
Following Eq.(\ref{mp}) and Eq.(\ref{hubblec}), we see that the 
Hubble size $1/H$ during this epoch is
much bigger than any of the compactification radii,
\be
  H^{-1} \gg r_i
\ee
This means that the Kibble mechanism is capable of producing only 
defects with vortex winding in the three large spacial dimensions.
The cosmological production of these defects towards the end of 
inflation are referred to as ``Kibble''  
in Table~\ref{inflatons}. During this epoch, the universe is 
essentially cold and so no thermal production of any defect is 
possible. Generically, codimension-one non-BPS defects may also
be produced. However, these decay rapidly and will be ignored here.
