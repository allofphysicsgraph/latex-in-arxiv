\item
For all $p$ there is a local maximum solution $\phi=\psi=1$, this is
the perturbative vacuum for both sectors. We may interpret it as a
D-brane filling all of our flat spacetime.
\item
For $p>2$ there is always a local minimum solution with $\phi=\psi=0$,
which is supposed to be the true open and closed string vacuum. For
$p=2$ this vacuum gets shifted by the interaction to $\phi=0, \,
\psi=-\frac{\lambda^2}{4} + O(\lambda^8)$.
\item
A third interesting solution is the saddle point $\phi=0, \, \psi = 1+
\frac{\lambda^2}{2p(p+1)} +O(\lambda^4)$. It is in fact a local
minimum in the $\phi$ direction and a local maximum in the $\psi$
direction.  And it is thus interpreted as being a perturbative flat
closed string background with no D-brane.
