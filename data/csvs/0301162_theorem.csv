Every quotient singularity is isomorphic to a quotient by a small
group $G \subset GL(n;\IC)$.

1,"\begin{theorem}
If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are small groups in $GL(n;\IC)$ and 
$\IC^n/G_1 \simeq \IC^n/G_2$, then $G_1$ and $G_2$ are conjugate
in $GL(n;\IC)$. 
\"
2,"\begin{theorem}
For small subgroups $\Gamma \subset \gl2$, 
the Ito-Nakamura construction for the
McKay Correspondence still holds if instead of considering
Irrep$^0(\Gamma)$,
we consider a subset, the so-called {\bf special representations}.
