\item $b=0$. In this case, the solution coincides with the one
described in~\cite{Carena:2002me}. There is a constant massless mode,
which depends on the brane terms only through its normalization:
\begin{equation}
f_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{a}{2\pi R}}} \, .
\end{equation}
The massive modes are given by
\begin{equation}
f_n(y)=A_n [\cos(m_n y)-\frac{a m_n}{2} \sin(m_n |y|)], 
\end{equation}
where $A_n$ is a normalization constant and
the masses are the solutions of the equation
\begin{equation}
\tan(\pi R m_n)+\frac{a}{2}m_n=0.
\label{Carenatwobranes:eigen}
\end{equation}
We observe that if $-2\pi R \leq a<0$, there is a tachyonic
mode, with squared mass approaching $-4/a^2$ for small $|a|/(2\pi
R)$. On the other hand, the norm squared defined by
the scalar product~\mbox{(\ref{scalarprod})}, $||f||^2=\mbox{$<f,f>$}$, is
indefinite. This can be problematic, since zero norm modes have
vanishing kinetic term in the reduced 4D action (they cannot be
normalized as in~\mbox{(\ref{normalizationcond})}), while modes with negative
norm squared have the wrong sign in the reduced kinetic term (they are
ghosts). 
We find that if $a=-2 \pi R$ the zero mode has zero norm,
and if $a<-2\pi R$ it has negative norm squared (the massive modes
have always positive norm). 
Therefore, we see that for negative values of $a$ the theory is either
pathological or unstable.

\item $b > 0$. In this case the solution is independent of all
brane terms, including $b$ itself (as long as it is strictly
positive). We find 
\begin{equation}
f_n(y)=A_n \sin(m_n |y|), 
\end{equation}
with $m_n=\frac{n+1/2}{R}$ and $n$ integer. In particular, there is no
zero mode.

\item $b=0$. There is a chiral zero mode with $f^R=0$ and a flat
left-handed wave function,
\begin{equation}
f_0^L = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{a^L}{2\pi R}}} \, .
\end{equation}
When $c=0$, the wave functions for massive modes
are\footnote{Strictly, there is no uniform convergence as $\eps
\rightarrow 0$ due to the behaviour around $y=0$. We write the
limiting functions for $|y|>\eta$, with $\eta$ an arbitrarily small
positive number, keeping in mind that
the interactions of the wave functions with the brane are to be
calculated before taking the limit $\eps\rightarrow 0$.}
\begin{align}
f_n^L=& B_n[\cos(m_n y) + \tan(m_n \pi R) \sin(m_n |y|)] \, , \\
f_n^R=& C_n[\sin(m_n y) - \sigma(y) \tan(m_n \pi R) \cos(m_n y)] \, ,
\end{align}
with $\sigma$ the sign function and masses given by
\begin{equation}
\tan(\pi R m_n) + \sqrt{\frac{a^L}{a^R}} \tan(\sqrt{a^L a^R} \,
\frac{m_n}{2})=0 \, .
\end{equation}
These solutions reduce to the ones for even scalar fields when
$a^R=0$. Note also that $a^R$ is irrelevant when $a^L=0$. The reason
is that only when $a^L$ forces a discontinuity at the brane is the
``odd-odd'' $a^R$ term nonvanishing for $\eps \rightarrow 0$.
When $c>0$, the solutions reduce again to the ones with $a^R=0$, \ie,
the only effect of a positive $c$ is to cancel the effect of $a^R$.

\item $b>0$. In this case, the wave functions (for $|y|>\eta>0$, see
previous footnote) and masses reduce to the ones without brane terms:
There is a chiral zero mode 
\begin{equation}
f_0^L = 1 \, ,
\end{equation}
and a tower of massive modes
\begin{align}
f_n^L =& B_n \cos(m_n y)  \, , \\
f_n^R =& B_n \sin(m_n y) \, ,
\end{align}
with $m_n=n/R$. In all cases, $f_n(0)=0$, so that the functions are
not piecewise continuous. More precisely, 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\eps\rightarrow 0} \int {\mathrm{d}} y \; \del_\eps(y) f^L_{\eps\,n}(y)
= 0 \, . 
\end{equation}
