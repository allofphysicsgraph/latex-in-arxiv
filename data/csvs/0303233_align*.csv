It is straightforward to check, that the energy of configuration (\ref{ZX^N})
is equal to zero, and thus it indeed describes a vacuum in the $U(1)$
theory. Equivalence between this vacuum and the trivial
vacuum in $U({\cal N})$ theory can be established using an isomorphism
$S:{\mathbb C}^{\cal N}\otimes
H\to H$, defined on the basis vectors as
\[
| a \rangle\otimes| n \rangle\stackrel{S}{\mapsto}| n{\cal N \rangle+a}
\]
which maps operators (\ref{Z^N}), (\ref{X^N}) into the following
operators acting in a direct sum
of ${\cal N}$ Hilbert spaces
\begin{subequations}
\label{ZX^NN}
\begin{gather}
{\bf Z}=
l\l\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}n
| n \rangle\langle n |\r\cdot{\bf{1}}\label{Z^NN}\\
{\bf X}_+=\rho\l\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}
| (n+1) \rangle\langle n |\r\cdot{\bf{1}}\label{X^NN}\;,
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}   
where ${\bf 1}$ stands for the unit ${\cal N}\times{\cal N}$ matrix.
Field configuration given by Eqs. (\ref{ZX^NN}) describes a trivial vacuum
in the $U({\cal N})$ theory. Using the same trick for the field
configurations describing fluctuations above the vacuum given by
Eqs. (\ref{ZX^N}), one observes that the action governing these
fluctuations is equivalent to the action describing fluctuations of
the $U({\cal N})$ theory in the vicinity of the trivial vacuum.

Thus, the $U(1)$ gauge theory on the fuzzy cylinder has
an infinite set of vacua labeled by ${\cal N}=1,2,\dots$ It is
natural to wonder whether these vacua correspond to different
superselection sectors, or are different phases of one and the
same theory. In particular, one may ask whether there exist solutions
(domain walls)
interpolating between different vacua. In the next section we answer
affirmatively to this question and explicitly find such domain wall 
solutions. 
%In particular, there are
%domain walls interpolating between Abelian and non-Abelian gauge
%theories. 


\section{Domain wall}
\label{3}
In what follows it is convenient to use 
the dimensionless
variables
\begin{equation}
Z=\frac{1}{l}{\bf Z}~,~~~X_{\pm}=\frac{1}{\rho}{\bf X}_{\pm}\;.
\label{redef}
\end{equation}
We search for a static solution of $U(1)$ gauge theory
on the fuzzy cylinder in the form of a domain
wall, separating vacua corresponding to different gauge
theories. We will work in the gauge $A_0=0$. 
For concreteness we first concentrate on the case of a
domain wall between $U(1)$ gauge theory in the region $z<0$ and $U(2)$
gauge theory in the region $z>0$. Then the asymptotics of the domain
wall are given by Eqs. (\ref{cyl}) and (\ref{ZX^N}), respectively,
\begin{subequations}
\label{asympt}
\begin{gather}
Z=\sum n| n \rangle\langle n |~,~~~
X_+=\sum| n+1 \rangle\langle n |~,~~~n\to -\infty\label{asympt-}\\
Z= \sum n(| 2n-1 \rangle\langle 2n-1 |+| 2n \rangle\langle 2n |)~,~~~
X_+=\sum| n+2 \rangle\langle n |~,~~~n\to +\infty\label{asympt+}\;.
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
Let us note that field configurations of finite energy, possessing
asymptotics (\ref{asympt}) do exist \cite{Bak:2001gm}. A simple example is
\begin{subequations}
\label{conf}
\begin{align}
&Z=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{0}n| n \rangle\langle n |+
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n(| 2n-1 \rangle\langle 2n-1 |+| 2n \rangle\langle 2n |)\label{confZ}\\
&X_+=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{0}| n+1 \rangle\langle n |+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}| n+2 \rangle\langle n |
\label{confX+}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
This configuration is not a static solution of the field 
equations for gauge theory on the fuzzy cylinder with 
action given by Eq.~(\ref{gaugeaction}). Nevertheless, it demonstrates
non-trivial topological properties one may expect for the domain wall
solution. In NC field theory 
the role of topological invariants is played
by traces
of commutators. Indeed, the latter do not change under 
small variations of operators they depend on. For configuration (\ref{conf}) we
have
\begin{equation}
{\rm Tr}[X_+,X_-]=-1\;.
\label{1top}
\end{equation}
The existence of such topological charge suggests a strategy of the
search for the domain wall solution: one may try
to obtain a BPS bound for the energy
functional following from Eq.~(\ref{gaugeaction}) in the topological sector
determined by Eq.~(\ref{1top}). However, as we will see below, the action
(\ref{gaugeaction}) as it stands does not admit BPS solutions with desired
properties --- the domain wall tends to dissolve. 

To stabilize
the domain wall, 
let us introduce the following additional term into the gauge theory
action
\begin{equation}
S_m=\int dt~\frac{2\pi\rho
l}{g^2}{\rm Tr}\left(-\frac{m^2}{16l^2}(X_+X_-+X_-X_+-2)^2\right)\;.
\label{addaction} 
\end{equation}
This term has simple physical
effect: it stabilizes the radius of the cylinder. 
In the commutative limit it becomes a mass term for the
adjoint scalar field $A_{\rho}$,
\[
S_m\to\int dt\rho d\theta dz
\left(-\frac{m^2}{g^2}A_{\rho}^2\right)\;\;\; {\mbox{as}}\;l\to 0\;. 
%\label{massadj}
\]
With this term added, the static energy takes the following form,
\begin{equation}
{\cal E}=\frac{2\pi}{g^2\rho l}{\rm Tr}\left(|[Z,X_+]-X_+|^2
+\frac{\lambda^2}{4}[X_+,X_-]^2+
\frac{\mu^2}{4}(X_+X_-+X_-X_+-2)^2\right)
\label{energyfunc}
\end{equation}
where we introduced dimensionless parameters
\begin{equation}
\lambda=\frac{\rho}{l}~,~~~\mu=\frac{m\rho}{2}\;.
\end{equation}
This expression can be rewritten in the BPS form
\begin{multline}
{\cal E}=\frac{2\pi}{g^2\rho l}{\rm Tr}\left(|[Z,X_+]-X_+|^2+
\left(\frac{\lambda}{2}[X_+,X_-]\pm\frac{\mu}{2}(\{X_+,X_-\}-2)\right)^2
\right.\\
\left.\mp\frac{\lambda\mu}{4}\{[X_+,X_-],(\{X_+,X_-\}-2)\}\right)\ge
\mp\frac{2\pi}{g^2\rho l}\frac{\lambda\mu}{2}Q\;,
\label{BPSenergy}
\end{multline}
where braces stand for anti-commutators, and
\begin{eqnarray}
Q=\frac{1}{2}{\rm Tr}\{[X_+,X_-],(\{X_+,X_-\}-2)\}
={\rm Tr}[X_+,(X_-X_+X_--2X_-)]
\label{topcharge}
\end{eqnarray}
is a topological charge. For the configuration (\ref{conf}) the
topological charge is equal to one.
Energy in each topological sector is
minimized by the solution of BPS equations, which follow from
Eq. (\ref{BPSenergy}),
\begin{subequations}
\label{BPSeqns}
\begin{align}
&[Z,X_+]-X_+=0\label{BPSeqn1}\\
&[Z,X_-]+X_-=0\label{BPSeqn2}\\
&(\lambda+\mu)X_-X_+\pm(\lambda-\mu)X_+X_-=2\mu\label{BPSeqn3}\;.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
These equations can be considered as defining an algebra with three
generators $Z$, $X_+$, $X_-$. Each solution of Eqs. (\ref{BPSeqns})
decomposes 
into direct sum of operators acting in
irreducible representations of this algebra. Thus, we have to classify
irreducible representations of the algebra (\ref{BPSeqns}).

Let us work in the eigenbasis $\{|z\rangle\}$ of the operator $Z$,
\[
Z| z \rangle=z| z \rangle
\]
It follows from Eqs.~(\ref{BPSeqn1}), (\ref{BPSeqn2}), that $X_+$, $X_-$ raise
and lower the eigenvalue $z$ by one,
\[
X_+| z \rangle=x_+(z)| z+1 \rangle~,~~~ X_-| z \rangle=x_-(z)| z-1 \rangle\;.
\]
Hence, in an irreducible representation, the eigenvectors of $Z$ 
may be labeled by an integer $k$, and in this
basis one has
%\bseq
\begin{gather}
Z=\sum_k (k+\gamma)| k \rangle\langle k |\nonumber\\
X_+=\sum_k x_k~| k+1 \rangle\langle k |\nonumber\\
X_-=\sum_k x^*_k~| k \rangle\langle k+1 |\nonumber\;,
\end{gather}
%\eseq
where $\gamma$ is a real parameter characteristic to the irreducible
representation.
Relation (\ref{BPSeqn3}) gives a recursion equation for the coefficients
$x_k$. Let us consider the lower sign in Eq.~(\ref{BPSeqn3}), then
\[
(\lambda+\mu)|x_k|^2-(\lambda-\mu)|x_{k-1}|^2=2\mu\;.
%\label{x_keqn}\;.
\]
The solution of this equation is
\[
|x_k|^2=1+C\alpha^k
\]
where
\[
\alpha=\frac{\lambda-\mu}{\lambda+\mu}\;,
%\label{alpha}
\]
and $C$ is an arbitrary constant. 
%We want the sequence $x_k$ to be
%bounded. 
Taking into account that $|\alpha|<1$ and that  $|x_k|^2>0$ 
we obtain three  different possibilities (up to redefinitions of $k$,
$C$ and $\alpha$): \\
{\em a}) $C=0$ and $k$ runs from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$; 
in this case $x_k=1$,\\  
{\em b}) $C=-1$ and $k$ runs from 1 to $+\infty$; in this case 
$x_k=\sqrt{1-\alpha^k}$,\\
{\em c}) $C>0$ and $\alpha>0$ and $k$ runs from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.

One may give the following geometric interpretation to these three types
of solutions. Let us consider them as axially symmetric fuzzy
manifolds where the role of coordinates is played by covariant
coordinates $X_+$, $X_-$ and $Z$. This kind of interpretation is quite common
in NC gauge theories; later it will be supported by the
study of the spectrum of small perturbations. The case  ({\em a})
corresponds just to the original fuzzy cylinder (see Fig. 1a)). The
case ({\em b})
corresponds to the semi-infinite fuzzy cylinder (``fuzzy fingerstall'') 
of variable radius,
starting at $z=\gamma$ and oriented towards positive values of
$z$ (see Fig. 1b)). Finally, the case ({\em c}) corresponds to an infinite
tube whose radius tends to unity as $z\to +\infty$ and becomes infinite
as $z\to -\infty$ (see Fig. 1c)).

Geometrical interpretation of the three types of solutions to

\end{figure}
It is straightforward to check that the topological charge $Q$ is equal to
zero in the first case, equal to one in the case ({\em b}) and is 
ill-defined in the case ({\em c}). We will not consider solutions of the
third type in this paper.

The solution corresponding to a domain wall between $U(1)$ and $U(2)$
gauge theories is a direct sum of representations ({\em a}) and ({\em b}),
\begin{subequations}
\label{domwall}
\begin{align}
&Z=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{0}n| n \rangle\langle n |+
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}n| 2n-1 \rangle\langle 2n-1 |+
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(n+\gamma)| 2n \rangle\langle 2n |\label{domwall1}\\
&X_+=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{0}| n+1 \rangle\langle n |+
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}| 2n+1 \rangle\langle 2n-1 |+
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sqrt{1-\alpha^n}| 2n+2 \rangle\langle 2n |\label{domwall2}\;.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
This domain wall has a simple geometrical  interpretation: 
%It 
%corresponds to a junction of one fuzzy cylinder (at $z\to-\infty$)
%into two parallel fuzzy cylinders (at $z\to+\infty$). 
it describes a parallel system of an 
infinite fuzzy cylinder and a half-infinite fuzzy fingerstall (see Fig. 2).
The topological charge $Q$ of this solution is equal to unity, as expected.
Without loss of generality we dropped in Eq.~(\ref{domwall1}) the possibility
of the overall shift of $Z$ by a $c$-number. Parameter
$\gamma$, as we will show later,
characterizes the position of the wall along $z$-coordinate. 
The energy of the wall is
\begin{equation}
{\cal E}=\frac{\pi m\rho}{2g^2l^2}
\label{dmwenergy}
\end{equation}
Its width $\delta z$ can be estimated as the size of the region along
$z$-direction, where
exact solution (\ref{domwall}) differs considerably from  
its asymptotic form (\ref{asympt}).
Then, restoring the dimensionality, one has
\begin{equation}
\delta z =\frac{l}{|\mathop{\rm ln}\nolimits{\alpha}|} \approx \frac{1}{m}\;\;\;{\mbox{at}}\;
m\ll\frac{1}{l}\;.
\label{dmwwidth}
\end{equation}
Note, that as $m$ tends to zero, the width of the wall becomes
infinite. This justifies our previous claim that in NC pure
Yang--Mills theory, the wall
tends to dissolve. Thus, we keep $m\neq 0$.
In the commutative limit $l\to 0$ the energy of the wall diverges,
 while its width stays
finite. Another interesting limit is that of the NC
plane. It corresponds to $\rho\to\infty$, $l\to 0$, and
$\vartheta=\rho l$ fixed. In this regime the energy (\ref{dmwenergy})
diverges as $\rho^3$, which means that our solution does not
correspond to a domain wall of finite tension on the NC
plane.
%corresponds to a junction of one fuzzy cylinder (at $z\to-\infty$)
%into two parallel fuzzy cylinders (at $z\to+\infty$). 
%The latter starts at  $z=\gamma$.

The solution (\ref{domwall}) is easy to generalize to $(U({\cal N}_1)-U({\cal
N}_2))$ domain wall with ${\cal N}_1 < {\cal N}_2$. One simply takes
the direct sum of ${\cal N}_1$ representations of type ({\em a})
(cylinders) and
${\cal N}_2-{\cal N}_1$ representations of type ({\em b})
(fingerstalls). 
The antiwall (that is $(U({\cal N}_1) - U({\cal N}_2))$ wall with 
${\cal N}_1 > {\cal N}_2 $) is the direct sum of irreducible
representations of the algebra defined by relations (\ref{BPSeqns}) with
upper sign in (\ref{BPSeqn3}). A system of a wall and an
antiwall will be studied in detail in section \ref{wall-antiwall}. 

\section{Scalars and fermions in the domain wall background}
\label{4}
\subsection{Adjoint scalar}
To figure out the properties of the domain wall solution constructed
in the previous section, let us consider a 
Hermitian adjoint scalar field $\phi$ in the $(U(1)-U(2))$ domain wall
background. The action is
\[
S_{\phi}=2\pi\rho l\int dt\, {\rm Tr}\left({1\over 2}{(D_0\phi)^2}+
\frac{1}{2\rho^2 l^2}\l
[{\bf Z},\phi]^2+
[{\bf X},\phi]^2+[{\bf Y},\phi]^2\r-
{1\over 2}{m_{\phi}^2\phi^2}\right)\;.
%\label{scalar}
\]
After redefinition (\ref{redef}) one obtains
\begin{equation}
S_{\phi}=\frac{\pi l}{\rho}\int dt\,{\rm Tr}\left(\rho^2(D_0\phi)^2+
[Z,\phi]^2-\lambda^2|[X_+,\phi]|^2-\mu_{\phi}^2\phi^2\right)\;.
\label{scact}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\phi}=m_{\phi}\rho$. Equations for normal modes following
from Eq.~(\ref{scact}) are
\begin{equation}
\rho^2\omega^2\phi=[Z,[Z,\phi]]+{\lambda^2\over 2}[X_-,[X_+,\phi]]+
{\lambda^2\over 2}[X_+,[X_-,\phi]]+\mu_{\phi}^2\phi\;,
\label{sceq}
\end{equation}
where 
%in the case of $(U(1)-U(2))$ domain wall 
operators $Z$, $X_+$
are given by (\ref{domwall}). It is convenient to decompose the Hilbert space
$H$ into direct sum $H=H_1\oplus H_2$ of two Hilbert spaces with
bases
\[
| c_n \rangle=\begin{cases}| n \rangle &n\leq 0\\
                       | 2n-1 \rangle &n\geq 1
          \end{cases}
%\label{base1}
\] 
and
\[
| h_p \rangle=| 2p \rangle~,~~~p\geq 1
%\label{base2}
\]
respectively. Background operators (\ref{domwall}) take the following form
\begin{subequations}
\label{backgrnd}
\begin{align}
&Z=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}n| c_n \rangle\langle c_n |+
\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}(p+\gamma)| h_p \rangle\langle h_p |\label{backgrnd1}\\
&X_+=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}| c_{n+1 \rangle}\langle c_n |+
\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}\sqrt{1-\alpha^p}| h_{p+1 \rangle}\langle h_p |\;.\label{backgrnd2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
These operators are block-diagonal in the sense that they 
map $H_i$ to $H_i$ ($i=1,2$). It is convenient to decompose 
the field $\phi$ as
\begin{equation}
\phi=\sum\phi_{nm}| c_n \rangle\langle c_m |+\sum\varphi_{pq}| h_p \rangle\langle h_q |+
\sum(\chi_{np}| c_n \rangle\langle h_p |+\chi_{np}^*| h_p \rangle\langle c_n |)\;,
\label{phidecomp}
\end{equation}
so that equations for different components $\phi_{nm}$, $\varphi_{pq}$
and $\chi_{np}$ decouple. 
One immediately notices 
that the indices $p$, $q$ are greater than zero, so nonvanishing
matrix elements of the operators $\varphi$ and $\chi$ have at least
one positive index. This implies that the modes described by these
operators live in the region $z > 0$ and cannot penetrate into the
region $z\to -\infty$.
Let us study the three types of modes entering the decomposition
(\ref{phidecomp})
separately.  

Equations for the $\phi_{nm}$-components in the
background (\ref{backgrnd}) exactly coincide with equations
for the scalar field on the fuzzy cylinder (\ref{sccomp}). 
Thus, excitations of this
type do not feel the presence of the fingerstall and freely propagate
from one end of the cylinder to the other.

Equations for the $\varphi_{pq}$-components have the following form,
\begin{align}
\rho^2\omega^2\varphi_{pq}&=
\left((p-q)^2+\mu_{\phi}^2+2\lambda^2
\left(1-\frac{\alpha^p+\alpha^{p-1}+\alpha^q+\alpha^{q-1}}{4}\right)
\right)\varphi_{pq}\nonumber\\
&-\lambda^2\sqrt{(1-\alpha^p)(1-\alpha^q)}\,\varphi_{p+1,q+1}
-\lambda^2\sqrt{(1-\alpha^{p-1})(1-\alpha^{q-1})}\,\varphi_{p-1,q-1}\;.
\nonumber
%\label{pqeq}
\end{align}
Let us perform Kaluza-Klein decomposition
in analogy to the case of free scalar field considered in section
\ref{2}. Namely, after fixing the number of the Kaluza--Klein mode,
$p-q=N$, we obtain the following
recursion relation for $\varphi_q\equiv\varphi_{q+N,q}$,
\begin{align}
\rho^2\omega^2\varphi_q&=
\left(N^2+\mu_{\phi}^2+2\lambda^2
\left(1-\frac{\alpha^{N+q}+\alpha^{N+q-1}+\alpha^q+\alpha^{q-1}}{4}\right)
\right)\varphi_q\nonumber\\
&-\lambda^2\sqrt{(1-\alpha^{N+q})(1-\alpha^q)}\,\varphi_{q+1}
-\lambda^2\sqrt{(1-\alpha^{N+q-1})(1-\alpha^{q-1})}\,\varphi_{q-1}\;.
\label{qeq}
\end{align}
At large $q$, the general solution of this equation is
\begin{equation}
\varphi_q=A\e^{iklq}+B\e^{-iklq}\;,
\label{qasymp}
\end{equation}
where the wave vector $k$ and frequency $\omega$ are related by
Eq.~(\ref{disp}). To relate the coefficients $A$ and $B$ let us note that
equation (\ref{qeq}) leads to the conservation of ``current'',
\[
J_{q+1}-J_q=0
\]
with
\[
J_q=i\sqrt{(1-\alpha^{N+q})(1-\alpha^q)}
(\varphi_{q+1}^*\varphi_q-\varphi_q^*\varphi_{q+1})\;.
%\label{phicurrent}
\]
Equation (\ref{qeq}) with $q=1$ implies that
\[
\varphi_2=c\varphi_1
\]
with real coefficient of proprtionality $c$. So
$J_1=0$ and,  as a consequence, we obtain that $J_q=0$ for all $q$. Then
the coefficients in Eq.~(\ref{qasymp}) have equal absolute values,
\[
|A|=|B|\;.
\] 
The asymptotic solution (\ref{qasymp}) describes two waves with equal amplitudes
propagating in the opposite directions. In other words, excitations 
$\varphi_{pq}$ experience total reflection from the domain wall.
Note that these modes do not feel the presence of the fuzzy cylinder 
and live entirely on the fingerstall. 

Modes $\chi_{np}$ obey the following equation,
\begin{multline}
\rho^2\omega^2\chi_{np}=\left((n-p-\gamma)^2+\mu_\phi^2+2\lambda^2
\left(1-\frac{\alpha^p+\alpha^{p-1}}{4}\right)\right)\chi_{np}\\-
\lambda^2\sqrt{1-\alpha^{p-1}}\,\chi_{n-1,p-1}-
\lambda^2\sqrt{1-\alpha^p}\,\chi_{n+1,p+1}\;.
\nonumber
%\label{npeq}
\end{multline} 
By fixing $n-p=N$ and substituting $\chi_p\equiv\chi_{p+N,p}$ one obtains
\begin{multline}
\rho^2\omega^2\chi_p=\left((N-\gamma)^2+2\lambda^2
\left(1-\frac{\alpha^p+\alpha^{p-1}}{4}\right)\right)\chi_p\\-
\lambda^2\sqrt{1-\alpha^{p-1}}\,\chi_{p-1}-
\lambda^2\sqrt{1-\alpha^p}\,\chi_{p+1}\;.
\nonumber
%\label{peq}
\end{multline} 
The analysis similar to that for modes $\varphi$ demonstrates that solutions of
this equation are waves which experience total reflection from the 
domain wall. Their dispersion relation is
\begin{equation}
\omega^2=\frac{(N-\gamma)^2}{\rho^2}+
\left(\frac{2}{l}\sin{\frac{kl}{2}}\right)^2+m_{\phi}^2\;.
\label{chidisp}
\end{equation}  
Let us comment on this result. 
First, if the parameter $\gamma$
is not integer, spectrum of the off-diagonal modes $\chi_{np}$ differs
from that of diagonal modes $\phi_{nm}$ and $\varphi_{pq}$. As 
$z\to +\infty$, the $\chi$ and $(\phi,\varphi)$ modes 
correspond to off-diagonal and
diagonal components of the adjoint $U(2)$ field, respectively. Difference
in their dispersion relations means that in the case of non-integer
$\gamma$ the gauge group $U(2)$  is broken down to
$U(1)\times U(1)$ at $z\to +\infty$. 
This effect is nothing else than spontaneous breaking of
the gauge symmetry by a nontrivial Wilson line on the
cylinder. Indeed, from
(\ref{athet}) and (\ref{domwall1}) we see that 
\[
A_{\theta}=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} 0&0\\ 0&\gamma
\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)~,~~~z\to +\infty\;.
\]
The value of the Wilson line around the cylinder is equal to
$\e^{2\pi i\gamma}\neq 1$ if $\gamma$ is not integer. Thus,
$A_{\theta}$ cannot be removed by a gauge transformation in this case
and breaks the gauge symmetry. Conversely, if $\gamma$ is integer,
$A_{\theta}$ is a pure gauge as $z\to +\infty$, and the 
symmetry $U(2)$ is unbroken
in the $z\to +\infty$ asymptotics. From now on we consider
integer values of $\gamma$ only.

Let us see now that the parameter $\gamma$ is related to the position of the
domain wall.
Equation (\ref{chidisp}) implies that the genuine Kaluza-Klein number of 
a $\chi$ excitation which characterizes its energy is
$N_0=N-\gamma$. The expression for $N_0$th KK
excitation in the operator form is
\[
\chi^{(N_0)}=\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}\chi_{p}^{(N_0)}| c_{\gamma+N_0+p \rangle}
\langle h_p |
%\label{chiN0}
\] 
The operator $\chi^{(N_0)}(\chi^{(N_0)})^{\dag}$ acts diagonally in $H_1$
and annihilates all vectors with 
\[
n<n_{min}\equiv N_0+\gamma+1\;.
\]
Hence, the $\chi$-wave is reflected from a point with $z$-coordinate 
$n_{min}$. 
For a given KK mode this coordinate depends
additively on $\gamma$, implying that this parameter is natural
to interpret as the
position of the wall\footnote{Strictly speaking, the above argument is not 
rigorous. The reason is that bilinear combinations of adjoint fields are
again adjoints and are not gauge invariant, while 
in NC theory gauge transformations of adjoints
include change of coordinates. Our conclusion that $\gamma$
characterizes the position of the domain wall will be
confirmed by the consideration of a fundamental field in the next
subsection. Namely, it will be shown that the position of the wall is
$\gamma$ plus a constant that depends on the parameters of the model,
see Eq. (\ref{position}).}.

Let us summarize our results on the spectrum of the adjoint field in
the presence of the domain wall. In the region $z\to +\infty$ there
are four (real) modes which constitute adjoint representation of
$U(2)$. Their dispersion relation is given by Eq.~(\ref{disp}) which reduces
to the standard dispersion relation on the cylinder in the long
wavelength regime. Three of these modes are reflected from the wall
while one freely propagates to the region
$z\to -\infty$. A notable fact is that the latter mode 
does not decouple from the other modes in the region $z\to +\infty$: in
terms of $U(2)$ group it has the form 
$\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
\phi&0\\ 0&0
\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)$, and couples to other modes due to gauge
interactions. These results can be straightforwardly
generalized to the case of the $(U({\cal N}_1)-U({\cal N}_2))$ domain
wall with ${\cal N}_1<{\cal N}_2$. In that case there are ${\cal N}_1^2$
modes in the adjoint of $U({\cal N}_1)$ group freely propagating along
the cylinder and $({\cal N}_2^2-{\cal N}_1^2)$ modes exhibiting
reflection from the domain wall.

The analysis of gauge field perturbations in the domain wall
background is less transparent because of mixing between
different components and the necessity to implement the Gauss'
constraint. We do not give the details here, and only states that the
qualitative picture described in the previous paragraph holds for the
gauge field perturbations as well. 
Namely, the $U({\cal N}_1)$ gauge fields propagate freely
along the entire cylinder; in the region $z\to +\infty$ they become a
part of $U({\cal N}_2)$ gauge multiplet; the rest of the $U({\cal
N}_2)$ gauge fields live only in the region on the right and are totally 
reflected from the wall.

\subsection{Fundamental fermion}

To study fermions in the background of the domain wall, we
have to  define the Dirac operator on the fuzzy cylinder. To this end let us
consider possible choices of the Dirac Hamiltonian on the commutative
cylinder. The simplest one is
\[
\tilde{D}=i\sigma_2\partial_z-\frac{i}{\rho}\sigma_3\partial_{\theta}
+\sigma_1m_f
%\label{Dtilde}
\]
where $m_f$ is the fermion mass and $\sigma_i$ are Pauli matrices. 
This operator is not
convenient for our purposes, 
because natural derivative
operators on the fuzzy cylinder 
are $x\partial_z$ and $y\partial_z$ rather than $\partial_z$
(see Eqs.~(\ref{Weylder1}), (\ref{Weylder2}))
\footnote{Nevertheless, one could proceed with the operator
$\tilde{D}$ and rewrite the term $i\sigma_2\partial_z\psi$ as
\[ 
i\frac{\sigma_2}{\rho^2}(x\cdot x\partial_z\psi+y\cdot y\partial_z\psi)
\]
Noncommutative counterpart of this expression would be
\[
\frac{\sigma_2}{\rho^2 l}({\bf x}[{\bf y},\psi]-{\bf y}[{\bf
x},\psi])=
\frac{\sigma_2}{\rho^2 l}({\bf x}\psi{\bf y}-{\bf y}\psi{\bf x})
\]
This operator leads to the second order recursion equations and
its spectrum suffers from doubling of fermion species, resembling that 
occurring
in the lattice field theory.}.
So, we will work with the following
unitary equivalent operator
\[
D=S^+\tilde{D}S\;,
\]
where
\begin{equation}
S=
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{i\theta/2}&0\\
0&e^{-i\theta/2}
\end{pmatrix}\;.
\label{matrixS}
\end{equation}
Explicitly, one has
\begin{equation}
D=\frac{1}{\rho}\left(-i(\sigma_1y-\sigma_2x)\partial_z
-i\sigma_3\partial_{\theta}+\frac{1}{2}+
(\sigma_1x+\sigma_2y)m_f\right)\;.
\label{DiracCom}
\end{equation}
Let us note that due to the form (\ref{matrixS}) of the 
unitary transformation $S$, periodic boundary conditions for the operator
$D$ correspond to anti-periodic boundary conditions for $\tilde{D}$ and
vice versa. This is not problematic, as one may consider both
periodic and anti-periodic spinors on the cylinder.

Noncommutative counterpart of the operator (\ref{DiracCom}) can be naturally
defined in terms of its action on a
spinor field $\psi$ as (cf. Eqs. (\ref{zderiv}), (\ref{Weylderiv}))
\begin{equation}
D\psi=\frac{1}{\rho l}(\sigma_1[{\bf x},\psi]+\sigma_2[{\bf y},\psi]
+\sigma_3[{\bf z},\psi])+\frac{1}{2\rho}\psi+
\frac{m_f}{2\rho}(\sigma_1\{{\bf x},\psi\}+\sigma_2\{{\bf y},\psi\})\;.
\label{DiracNC}
\end{equation}
The operator ordering in the mass term in Eq.~(\ref{DiracNC}) is chosen somewhat
arbitrarily; a different choice would not alter the results of the
analysis below but would make calculations more cumbersome. The spectrum
of the operator (\ref{DiracNC}) is 
\begin{equation}
\omega^2=\frac{(N+1/2)^2}{\rho^2}+
\left(\frac{2}{l}\sin{\frac{kl}{2}}\right)^2+
\left(m_f\cos{\frac{kl}{2}}\right)^2\;,
\label{dispDirac}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the Kaluza-Klein number and $k$ is the wave vector. 
Two comments on this dispersion relation are in order. 
First, the appearance of $(N+1/2)$ instead of $N$ in the
first term of Eq.~(\ref{dispDirac}) is not unexpected, 
since as discussed above we are effectively 
considering anti-periodic fermions. The dependence on
$k$ in the third (mass) term is more surprising. 
Interestingly, the same dependence appears in the
dispersion relation for the field $A_{\rho}$ defined by Eqs.~(\ref{xdecomp}),
(\ref{ydecomp}) when the term (\ref{addaction}) is added to the gauge action. 

The Dirac Hamiltonian for fermion in the fundamental representation of
the gauge 
group is obtained from Eq.~(\ref{DiracNC}) via substitution
%\bseq
%\label{covariantpsi}
\begin{gather}
[{\bf x},\psi]~ \longrightarrow ~{\bf X}\psi-\psi {\bf x}\nonumber\\
\{{\bf x},\psi\}~ \longrightarrow ~{\bf X}\psi+\psi {\bf x}\nonumber
\end{gather}
%\eseq
and similarly for other coordinates. In the domain wall background
(\ref{domwall}), it is convenient to decompose the fermion field in the
following way (cf. Eq.~(\ref{phidecomp}))
\[
\psi=\sum_{n,m=-\infty}^{\infty}\psi_{nm}| c_n \rangle\langle m |+
\sum_{p=1, n=-\infty}^{\infty}\eta_{pn}| h_p \rangle\langle n |\;.
%\label{psidecomp}
\]
Equations for the $\psi_{nm}$-components are identical to those
obtained in the
case of  fuzzy cylinder without the domain wall, and the corresponding
branch of
the spectrum is given by Eq. (\ref{dispDirac}). Thus,
these modes do not feel the presence of the domain wall at all. For
spinors $\eta_{pn}$ we obtain the following equations,
\[
\omega\rho\begin{pmatrix}\eta^1_{pn}\\
                         \eta^2_{pn}\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
(p-n+\gamma+\frac{1}{2})\eta^1_{pn}+
(\lambda+\frac{\mu_f}{2})\sqrt{1-\alpha^p}\eta^2_{p+1,n}
-(\lambda-\frac{\mu_f}{2})\eta^2_{p,n-1}\\
(\lambda+\frac{\mu_f}{2})\sqrt{1-\alpha^{p-1}}\eta^1_{p-1,n}
-(\lambda-\frac{\mu_f}{2})\eta^1_{p,n+1}-(p-n+\gamma-\frac{1}{2})\eta^2_{pn}
\end{pmatrix},
%\label{etapn}
\]
where $\mu_f=m_f\rho$. After
substituting $\eta^1_p\equiv \eta^1_{p,p+N}$,
$\eta^2_p\equiv \eta^2_{p,p+N-1}$,  equations along diagonals $n-p=N$ 
take the form
\[
\omega\rho\begin{pmatrix}\eta^1_{p}\\
                         \eta^2_{p}\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
(-N+\gamma+\frac{1}{2})\eta^1_{p}+
(\lambda+\frac{\mu_f}{2})\sqrt{1-\alpha^p}\eta^2_{p+1}
-(\lambda-\frac{\mu_f}{2})\eta^2_{p}\\
(\lambda+\frac{\mu_f}{2})\sqrt{1-\alpha^{p-1}}\eta^1_{p-1}
-(\lambda-\frac{\mu_f}{2})\eta^1_{p}-(-N+\gamma+\frac{1}{2})\eta^2_{p}
\end{pmatrix}.
%\label{etap}
\]
Since $n=p+N > N$, a KK mode with fixed $N$ does not penetrate into 
the region $z\to
-\infty$ and thus is reflected from the domain wall. In this respect 
the situation
is similar to the case of the adjoint scalar
considered in the previous subsection. 

Let us find now a zero mode localized on the domain
wall. By zero mode we understand a mode which is
annihilated by the transverse part of the Dirac Hamiltonian.
In other words, it obeys the following equations
\begin{align}
\label{firsteta}
&\left(\lambda+\frac{\mu_f}{2}\right)\sqrt{1-\alpha^{p-1}}\,\eta^1_{p-1}-
\left(\lambda-\frac{\mu_f}{2}\right)\eta^1_{p}=0\\
\label{secondeta}
&\left(\lambda+\frac{\mu_f}{2}\right)\sqrt{1-\alpha^p}\,\eta^2_{p+1}-
\left(\lambda-\frac{\mu_f}{2}\right)\eta^2_{p}=0\;.
\end{align}
%supplemented by boundary conditions:
%\[
%\eta^{1,2}_0=0~,~~~\lim_{p\to\infty}\eta^{1,2}_p=0
%\]
Equation (\ref{firsteta}) with $p=1$ implies that $\eta^1_1=0$, and as a
consequence
\begin{equation}
\eta^1_p=0
\label{eta1}
\end{equation} 
for all $p$.
From Eq.~(\ref{secondeta}) one obtains the following solution 
for $\eta^2_p$-components
\begin{equation}
\eta^2_p=C\beta^{p-1}
\prod_{j=1}^{p-1}(1-\alpha^j)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\;,
\label{zeroeta}
\end{equation}
where
\[
\beta=\frac{\lambda-\mu_f/2}{\lambda+\mu_f/2}\;.
\]
and $C$ is a normalization constant. This solution is well-behaved at
large $p$ for $\mu_f>0$. 
Note that zero mode (\ref{eta1}), (\ref{zeroeta}) is
chiral
\[
\sigma_3\eta=-\eta\;.
\]
A zero mode with opposite chirality is localized on the antiwall
configuration. 

Let us work out the profile of zero mode along $z$-direction. This
profile is a gauge invariant characteristic
of the domain
wall shape. We assume $\mu, \mu_f\ll\lambda$. 
First, let us note that the  energy of zero mode on the $N$-th diagonal
is given by
\[
\omega=\frac{N-\gamma-1/2}{\rho}\;.
\]
Thus, the genuine Kaluza-Klein number of this mode is 
$N_0=N-\gamma-1$. From Eq.~(\ref{zeroeta}) one obtains the following
gauge invariant density
\begin{equation}
\eta^{\dag}\eta=\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}\left(\eta^2_p\right)^2
| N_0+\gamma+p \rangle\langle N_0+\gamma+p |\;.
\label{density}
\end{equation} 
Its Weyl symbol is shown in Fig. 3.
\begin{figure}[tb]
\begin{center}
%\begin{picture}(500,100)(0,0)
\epsfig{file=zeromode.eps,height=4.cm,width=10.cm} 
%\end{picture}
\end{center}
\caption{Gauge invariant 
profile of zero fermion mode localized on the domain wall.}
\end{figure}
This density concentrates near $p=p_{max}$ with $p_{max}$ determined by
\[
1-\alpha^{p_{max}}=\beta^2
\]  
or, explicitly,
\begin{equation}
p_{max}=\frac{\lambda}{2\mu}\mathop{\rm ln}\nolimits{\frac{\lambda}{2\mu_f}}
\label{pmax}
\end{equation}
Coefficients entering Eq.~(\ref{density}) may be approximated 
in the vicinity of $p_{max}$ as follows,
\begin{equation}
\left(\eta_p^2\right)^2=\tilde{C}^2\exp{\left(-\frac{2\mu_f\,\mu}{\lambda^2}
(p-p_{max})^2\right)}
\label{approxeta}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{C}$ is a constant. Combining
Eqs.~(\ref{density}) and (\ref{approxeta}), one expresses the  symbol of
$\eta^{\dag}\eta$ in terms of physical parameters,
\[
\widetilde{\eta^{\dag}\eta}(z)=\tilde{C}^2
\exp{\Bigl(-m_f\,m(z-z_{max})^2\Bigr)}\;,
%\label{Weyleta}
\]
where
\begin{equation}
z_{max}=\frac{1}{m}\mathop{\rm ln}\nolimits{\frac{1}{2m_f\,l}}+l\gamma+lN_0\;.
\label{zmax}
\end{equation}
If $N_0$ is not too large, the last term in Eq.~(\ref{zmax}) can be
neglected. Assuming additionally $m_f\approx m$, one obtains the following
estimates for the position $z_{max}$ and width $\delta z$ of the domain wall
\begin{equation}
z_{max}\approx \frac{1}{m}\mathop{\rm ln}\nolimits{\frac{1}{2ml}}+l\gamma~,~~~
\delta z\approx \frac{1}{m}\;.
\label{position}
\end{equation}
The estimate for the width agrees with that
deduced from the (gauge dependent) profile of the domain wall, see
Eq. (\ref{dmwwidth}). However, the 
gauge invariant profile of the fermion zero mode
indicates that the fermion sees the domain wall located  at
$z_d=z_{max}$. This estimate for a position of the domain
wall may significantly disagree with the naive one,
$z_d=l\gamma$, based on the gauge dependent shape of the domain wall itself.
It is worth noting, however, that fermions with different masses (and
KK numbers) see
different widths and positions of the domain wall, so it is problematic
to provide a probe-independent meaning to these notions.

\section{Wall--antiwall system}
\label{wall-antiwall}

Similarly to the domain wall solution, it is convenient to describe
the wall--antiwall
configuration 
in terms of operators acting on a direct sum of Hilbert spaces
$H=H_1\oplus H_2$. 
Subspaces $H_1$ and $H_2$ emerging in the case of  the wall--antiwall
system are spanned by the
following systems of basis vectors
\begin{gather}
| c_n \rangle=| n \rangle~,~~~n\leq 0
\nonumber\\
%\label{base3}\\
| h_p \rangle=| p \rangle~,~~~p\geq 1\;.
\nonumber
%\label{base4}
\end{gather}
In these notations the wall--antiwall field has the following form
\begin{subequations}
\label{wallanti}
\begin{align}
&Z=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{0}(n+\gamma_1)| c_n \rangle\langle c_n |
+\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}(p+\gamma_2)| h_p \rangle\langle h_p |\label{wallantiZ}\\
&X_+=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{0}\sqrt{1-\alpha^{-n}}| c_{n+1 \rangle}\langle c_n |
+\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}\sqrt{1-\alpha^p}| h_{p+1 \rangle}\langle h_p |\label{wallantiX+}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
This may be viewed as the union of two fingerstalls. Two physically
different situations occur depending on the value of the parameter
$\Delta\gamma\equiv\gamma_2-\gamma_1$: for $\Delta\gamma > 0$ the two
fingerstalls intersect (see Fig. 4a) and, as we will see below, $U(2)$
gauge theory emerges in the region between the walls, while for
$\Delta\gamma < 0$ the fingerstalls are disconnected (Fig. 4b).

Due to the direct sum structure of Eqs.~(\ref{wallanti}), they describe an
exact solution of field equations. This is somewhat unexpected, because it
implies that there is no attraction between the wall and antiwall. On
the other hand, configuration (\ref{wallanti}) belongs to the trivial
topological sector (it is straightforward to check that its topological
charge $Q$ defined in "
