\section{Appendix: Closed String Scattering off of $D$-branes}\label{closedscat}

Closed strings fields such as the dilaton, graviton,
anti-symmetric tensor field, and massive modes can interact with a
brane by exchanging closed strings.  One can think of this as
spontaneously created open strings on the brane absorbing and then
re-emitting closed strings and then subsequently annihilating
themselves.  This is the $t$ channel point of view, see figure
\ref{branebulk}. The dual $s$ channel process is: a closed string
strikes the brane, creates an open string excitation which then
propagates along the brane and is eventually annihilated when it
emits another closed string~\cite{klebanov, garousi}.

We are concerned most with the $t$ channel because, the $t$
channel scattering amplitude blows up for small scattering angle.
This divergence is also common to scattering by other solitons
like monopoles.

\EPSFIGURE[l]{branebulk.eps,width=6cm}{$t$ channel scattering by a
brane. \label{branebulk}}


The form of the scattering amplitude can be guessed as follows.
Because of the exchange of a massless particle, there will be a
pole and $ {\cal{A}} \sim 1/t$ where $t$ is the exchanged momentum
squared. The numerator of the amplitude should possess some
momentum dependent factors because the interactions between the
bulk and the brane occur via quadratic derivative interactions.

%However, since there is
%effectively one initial state and and one final state (in the limit of
%small recoil by the brane), that momentum factor should be no more
%than quadratic, and should involve the polarisation tensors of the
%incoming and outgoing strings.

Because the amplitude is stringy, there should also be a series of
Regge poles, allowing for not only massless closed string exchange, but
the exchange of massive closed strings as well.  Thus we expect that

\begin{equation}
{\cal{A}} =   \frac{a_1}{t} + \frac{a_2}{t+1} + \frac{a_3}{t+2} + \cdots
\label{tchn}
\end{equation}

\n where we have taken the poles, in appropriate units, to be
$n\in {1, 2 ,3....} = \IZ$. The $a_i$ factors are quadratic in the
initial and final momenta, $p_1,p_2$.  The amplitude for massless
exchange $a_1/t$, should be proportional the $g_s$, since for $g_s
\rightarrow 0$ the brane  should decouple from the bulk and no
scattering should occur.  The simplest way to achieve this is for
$a_1 \sim \kappa^2 \tau_p \cdot ({\rm function~of~}p_1,p_2),~$
since the amplitude should be proportional to Newton's constant
$\kappa^2 \sim g_s^2$.

Because momentum is conserved only parallel to the brane, (in the
limit of small recoil), the only invariants are


\begin{eqnarray}
s & = & 2 \alpha'(p^2_1)_{||} = 2 \alpha'(p^2_2)_{||} \nonumber\\
t & = & -\alpha'(p_1 +p_2)^2 = -2\alpha'p_1 \cdot p_2
\end{eqnarray}



More formally, in the limit of no recoil the tree level stringy amplitude can be
found by calculating the disk amplitude with insertions of two closed
string vertex operators in the interior of the disk.

\beq
{\cal{A}} = \int \frac{d^2z_1 d^2z_2}{V_{CKG}} \langle
V_1(z_1,\bar{z}_1) V_2(z_2, \bar{z}_2)\rangle
\eeq

\n $V_1$ and $V_2$ can be decomposed into two right moving
operators and two left moving operators. After fixing the
positions of three of them one finds the familiar Veneziano
scattering amplitude~\cite{klebanov, garousi}

\begin{equation}
{\cal{A}}  =   c_1\frac{\Gamma(t) \Gamma(s)}{\Gamma(1+s+t)} (s a_1 -t
a_2) \delta^{p+1}(p_1+p_2)
\label{venez}
\end{equation}



\n where $(s a_1 - t a_2)$ is a kinematic factor and is equal to $s {\rm
Tr}(\epsilon_1 \cdot \epsilon_2)$ if the initial and final state
polarisations, $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$, are orthogonal to the
brane. The delta function insures that momentum is conserved on the
brane. When expanded in the $t$-channel ($t\ll 1, s\gg 1$), the
amplitude (\ref{venez}) takes the form of (\ref{tchn}).  The constant $c_1$ is

\begin{equation}
c_1 = \frac{1}{g_o^2 \alpha' } \cdot \left ( \frac{\kappa}{\alpha'}
\right )^2 \cdot (\alpha'^2) \sim g_s
\label{c1}
\end{equation}

The factor on the left is the normalization of the disk amplitude.
Note that because the open string coupling constant $g_o$ is
basically the Yang-Mills coupling constant, in dimensions other
than four it is dimensionful, $1/g_o^2 \sim \alpha'^2\tau_p$.  The
second factor in (\ref{c1}) comes from the insertion of two closed
string vertex operators. The third factor comes from evaluating
two sets of propagators like $\langle X(z_1) X(z_2) \rangle =
\alpha' \ln|z_1-z_2|$.\footnote{Note the conventions,
\begin{equation} g^2_o = \frac{1}{(2 \pi \alpha')^2 \tau_p};~~~~
\tau_p = \frac{1}{g_s (2\pi)^p\sqrt{\alpha'}^{p+1}};~~~~ \kappa^2
= \frac{(2\pi)^7}{2} g_s^2 \alpha'^4. \label{formulas}
\end{equation}}

The amplitude can also be derived from an effective gravity
picture~\cite{garousi}.  The NS-NS sector of the low energy action of
Type II theories is

\beq
I_{NS} = \int d^{10}x \sqrt{-g} \left[\frac{1}{2\kappa^2} R -
\frac{1}{2} (\nabla \phi)^2 - \frac{3}{2} H^2 e^{-\sqrt{2} \kappa
\phi} \right ]
\eeq

\n The source term  for a D-brane is

\beq
I_s = \int d^{10}x \sqrt{-g}[S^{\mu \nu}_B B_{\mu \nu} + S_{\phi} \phi
+ S^{\mu \nu}_h h_{\mu \nu}]
\eeq

To leading order the source functions will be delta function sources at
the positions of the branes.  For example, the Fourier transform of
the dilaton source is $\tilde{S}_{\phi}(k) = -\tau_p(p-3)/\sqrt{8}$.
If one expands the metric as $g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + 2 \kappa
h_{\mu \nu}$, we can read off the  dilaton-dilaton-graviton vertex
$\tilde{V}_{h\phi\phi}$ as follows


%\beq
%{\cal{A}'}_{h\phi} = i \tilde{S}_{\phi}(t)\tilde{G}_{\phi}(t)
%\tilde{V}){h\phi\phi}
%\eeq
%as and find that the amplitude

\beq
2\kappa h_{\mu \nu} \partial^{\mu} \phi \partial^{\nu} \phi
\rightarrow 2\kappa \epsilon_{\mu \nu} p_1^{\mu} p_2^{\nu} \phi(p_1)
\phi(p_2)
\eeq

\n and find that the amplitude

\beq
{\cal{A}} = i\tilde{S}_{\phi}(t)\tilde{G}_{\phi}(t)\tilde{V}_{h\phi\phi}
\eeq

\n is the same as the massless part of (\ref{tchn}) and
(\ref{venez}) if we perform a field redefinition $h_{\mu \nu}
\rightarrow 2 \kappa h_{\mu \nu}$ and $ \phi \rightarrow \sqrt{2}
\kappa \phi$.

The high energy limit, $ s,t\gg 0$ of the amplitude (\ref{venez})
is exponentially damped because of the Regge poles (${\cal{A}}
\sim s \exp(-\alpha' s m(\phi)/2)$~\cite{gross}. However, it peaks
in the small momentum transfer limit $t\ll 1$, but large energy
limit $s\gg 1$.  In that case

\beq
{\cal{A}} = c_1 \frac{s}{t} = \frac{c_1}{2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\eeq

\n where we have assumed that momentum of the incoming particles
to the brane such that $s=\alpha' E^2$. This is the massless term
in our heuristic derivation (\ref{tchn}). The above amplitude is
the zero recoil limit.  In this case, $p_1 = p_2$, because as in
usual Compton scattering for $m_{Dp} \rightarrow
\infty$~\cite{peskin}

\beq
\omega_2 =  \frac{\omega_1}{1+ \frac{\omega_1}{m_{Dp}} (1-\cos \theta
)}  \overbrace{\longrightarrow}^{m\rightarrow \infty} \omega_1
\eeq

Thus $t = p_1 \cdot p_2 = \alpha' E^2 (1-\cos \theta)$.  Because
of this and momentum conservation, the final state $|f \rangle $ will
be identical to the initial state $|i \rangle $.  The probability of
scattering is

\beq
{\cal{P}}(i \rightarrow i)= \frac{|\langle i | S |i \rangle
|^2}{\langle i | i \rangle
\langle i | i \rangle}  =   \frac{|{\cal{A}}|^2}{2 p_1 \cdot 2 p_1 }
\sim \frac{g_s^2}{E^2 \sin^2 \theta/2}
\eeq

\n where we have explicitly included the normalization, $\langle i | i
\rangle = \langle p_1 | p_1 \rangle = 2 E_{p_1}$.

The cross section will be proportional to ${\cal{P}}(i \rightarrow i)$
once we average over the angle $\theta$.  Thus

\beq
\sigma_s \sim \frac{g_s^2}{E^2} \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\theta_{min}}^{2\pi}
\frac{d\theta}{\sin^2 \theta/2} \sim  \frac{g_s^2}{E^2}
\label{xsect}
\eeq

\EPSFIGURE[l]{monopole.eps,width=6cm}{Scattering of a bulk particle by
a brane.  Note, $t$ is time, and $r$ is the distance from the brane to
the bulk particle. \label{monopole}}


The dimensionful factors ignored in (\ref{xsect}) are simply factors
of $\alpha'$ and are not so important in determining the energy
dependence of $\sigma_s$.  The integral in (\ref{xsect}) diverges for
$\theta_{min} =0$.  Now a small deflection angle corresponds to a
large impact parameter~\cite{kolb2}. However, because the bulk fields
scatter off other bulk fields as well as the brane, the maximum impact
parameter of a particle which solely scatters off the brane is
bounded.  A bulk particle will feel a long range force from other bulk
particles.  The momentum change due to brane-bulk scattering will be
(see figure \ref{monopole})

\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta p & = & \int F dt \sim  \int \frac{dt}{r^{8-p}} =
\int_0^{\infty} \frac{dt}{(b^2 +t^2)^{(8-p)/2}} \nonumber\\
& = &
\frac{1}{b^{7-p}} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{d(t/b)}{((t/b)^2+1)^{(8-p)/2}}
\sim \frac{1}{b^{7-p}}
\end{eqnarray}

\n where $b$ is the impact parameter and $t$ is time. The angle of
deflection will be $\theta = \Delta p/p$.  If the mean free path of
the bulk fields is $\ell$, and $p\sim T$, then $\theta_{min} \sim
1/(T\ell^{7-p}).$ Hence, the forward scattering limit of (\ref{xsect})
is not singular.
