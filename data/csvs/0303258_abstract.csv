It was generally believed that, in general relativity, the fundamental
laws of nature should be invariant or covariant under a general
coordinate transformation. In general relativity, the equivalence
principle tells us the existence of a local inertial coordinate
system and the fundamental laws in the local inertial coordinate system
which are the same as those in inertial reference system. Then, after a
general coordinate transformation, the fundamental laws of nature
in arbitrary coordinate system or in arbitrary curved space-time can
be obtained.  However, through a simple example, we find
that, under a general coordinate transformation, basic physical
equations in general relativity do not transform covariantly,
especially they do not preserve their forms under the transformation
from a local inertial coordinate system to a curved space-time.
The origination of the violation of the general covariance is then
studied, and a general theory on general coordinate
transformations is developed.  Because of the the existence of the
non-homogeneous term, the fundamental laws of nature in
arbitrary curved space-time can not be expressed  by space-time
metric, physical observable and their derivatives. In other words,
basic physical equations obtained from the equivalence principle and
the principle of general covariance are different from those
in general relativity.
Both the equivalence principle and the principle of general covariance
can not be treated as foundations of general
relativity. So, what are the foundations of General Relativity?
Such kind of essential problems on General Relativity
can be avoided in the physical picture of gravity.
Quantum gauge theory of gravity, which is founded in the physics
picture of gravity,  does not have such kind of fundamental
problems.
