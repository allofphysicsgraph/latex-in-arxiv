We demonstrate the existence of a class of $ \mathcal{N} = 1 $
supersymmetric nonperturbative vacua of Ho\v{r}ava-Witten M-theory
compactified on a torus fibered Calabi-Yau
3-fold $ Z $ with first homotopy group $ \pi_{1} (Z) = \mathbb{Z}_{2} $,
having the following properties: 1) $ SO(10) $ grand unification group,
2) net number of three generations of chiral fermions in the
observable sector, and 3) potentially viable matter Yukawa couplings. 
These vacua correspond to semistable holomorphic vector bundles 
$ V_{Z} $ over $ Z $ having structure group $ SU(4)_{\mathbb{C}} $, and 
generically contain M5-branes in the bulk space. The nontrivial
first homotopy group allows Wilson line breaking of the $ SO(10) $
symmetry. Additionally, we propose how the 11-dimensional
Ho\v{r}ava-Witten M-theory framework may be used to extend
the perturbative calculation of the top quark Yukawa coupling in the
realistic free-fermionic models to the nonperturbative regime. 
The basic argument being that the relevant coupling couples
twisted-twisted-untwisted states and can be 
calculated at the level of the $ Z_{2} \times Z_{2} $
orbifold without resorting to the full three generation models.
