These relations are valid along any $Z_N$-invariant renormalization 
group trajectory flowing out of the phase transition point and 
characterise the operators $\mu_k(x)$ beyond their initial role of 
kink creation operators in the broken phase. The theory (\ref{action}) 
with $W=0$ is a particularly simple example of such a trajectory 
for which, as we will see, the correlation functions of disorder 
operators remain non-trivial due to the non-locality with respect 
to the boson. 

The correlation functions of non-local operators in two-dimensional free 
massive theories were extensively studied from the point of view of the 
isomonodromy theory of differential equations in Ref.\,\cite{SMJ} and a 
series of related papers. Several works (see for instance 
Refs.\cite{BKW,MSS,Alyosha,BB,BL}) have been devoted afterwards 
to dealing with this problem through more direct and general methods of 
quantum field theory. As we have seen above, an important approach to 
compute the correlation functions is the one based on the form factors, 
in which the correlators are expressed as sums over multiparticle 
asymptotic states. In our example this series can be explicitly 
resummed and the correlators are given in terms of solutions 
of non-linear differential equations. Moreover, there is a simple 
unified treatment of the bosonic and fermionic cases, with the final 
result expressed by the correspondence\footnote{We use the notation 
$\tilde{\Phi}(x)\equiv\Phi(x)/\langle\Phi\rangle$.} 
\EQ
\langle\tilde{\mu}_j(x)\tilde{\mu}_k(0)\rangle
=\frac{1}{\langle\tilde{V}_{j/N}(x)\tilde{V}_{k/N}(0)\rangle}\,,
\label{main}
\EN
where the correlators on the l.h.s. are computed in the theory (\ref{action})
with $W=0$, and those on the r.h.s. refer to the operators
$V_\alpha(x)=\exp[i\sqrt{4\pi}\,\alpha\,\varphi(x)]$
in the sine-Gordon theory
\EQ
{\cal A}_{sG}=\int d^2x\left[\frac{1}{2}\,
\partial_\nu\varphi\partial^\nu\varphi-\mu\cos\beta\varphi\right]\,,
\label{sg}
\EN
with $\beta=\sqrt{4\pi}$ and $\mu$ a suitably chosen mass scale. 
The theory (\ref{sg}) with $\beta=\sqrt{4\pi}$ is in 
fact a free fermionic theory \cite{Coleman}. For generic values of $\beta$
the elementary excitations are the solitons and antisolitons interpolating 
between adjacent vacua of the periodic potential. Their interaction is 
attractive as long as $\beta<\sqrt{4\pi}$ and they form topologically 
neutral bound states, the lightest one being the particle interpolated by 
the bosonic field in the action (\ref{sg}). These neutral particles are 
absent from the spectrum of asymptotic states in the repulsive region
$\beta>\sqrt{4\pi}$, and at the point $\beta=\sqrt{4\pi}$ where the 
solitons behave as free Dirac fermions.

Since the solitons are non-local in terms of the field $\varphi(x)$,
the evaluation of both sides of Eq.\,(\ref{main}) amounts to computing
correlation functions of operators which are non-local with respect to 
non-interacting particles, bosons for the l.h.s. and fermions for the r.h.s. 
The different statistics of the two particles is responsible 
for the inversion in Eq.\,(\ref{main}). 

Consider then a theory of free, charge conjugated particles $A$ and 
$\bar{A}$ with mass $m$, and denote by $\Phi_\alpha(x)$ a scalar operator 
having a non-locality phase $e^{2i\pi\alpha}$ ($e^{-2i\pi\alpha}$) with 
respect to (the field which interpolates) the particle $A$ ($\bar{A}$). 
Acting on the vacuum state $|0\rangle$, such an operator produces 
neutral states consisting of pairs $A(\theta)\bar{A}(\beta)$. 
The equations satisfied by the form factors of these theories 
\bea
&& f^\alpha_n(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n) = 
\label{ff}\\
&& =\langle 0|\tilde{\Phi}_\alpha(0)|A(\theta_1),\dots,
A(\theta_n),\bar{A}(\beta_1),\dots,\bar{A}(\beta_n)\rangle \nonumber 
\eea
are a particular case of those holding for generic integrable theories 
(see e.g.\,\cite{Alyosha})
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& f_n^\alpha(\theta_1,\dots ,\theta_i ,\theta_{i+1},\dots,\theta_n,\beta_1,
\dots,\beta_n)  = \\
&& =S\,f_n^\alpha(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_{i+1},\theta_i,\dots,\theta_n,\beta_1,
\dots,\beta_n), \\ 
&& f_n^\alpha(\theta_1+2i\pi,\theta_2,\dots,\theta_n,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n) =\\ 
&& = S\,e^{ 2 i \pi \alpha} 
f_n^\alpha(\theta_1, \dots,\theta_n,\beta_1, \dots,\beta_n), \\ 
&& \textrm{Res}_{\theta_1-\beta_1= i \pi} f_n^\alpha(\theta_1, \dots,\theta_n,\beta_1, 
\dots,\beta_n) = \\
&& = iS^{n-1}(1-e^{ 2 i \pi \alpha})f_{n-1}^\alpha(\theta_2,
..,\theta_n,\beta_2,..,\beta_n),
\end{eqnarray*}
where 
\EQ
S=\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
1 & \mbox{for free bosons} \\
-1 & \mbox{for free fermions}\,. \\
\end{array}
\right.
\EN
It is easy to check that the solution of the above system of 
equations is given by 
\bea
&& f^\alpha_n(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_n) =
S^{n(n+2)/2}(-\sin\pi\alpha)^n \nonumber \\
&& \times \,e^{\left(\alpha-\frac12\delta_{S,1}\right)
\sum_{i=1}^n(\theta_i-\beta_i)}\,
\left|A_n\right|_{(S)}\,,
\label{solution}
\eea
where $A_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix ($A_0\equiv 1$) with entries
\EQ
A_{ij}=\frac{1}{\cosh\frac{\theta_i-\beta_j}{2}}\,,
\EN
and $\left|A_n\right|_{(S)}$ denotes the 
permanent\footnote{The permanent of a matrix differs from the 
determinant by the omission of the alternating sign factors $(-1)^{i+j}$.} 
of $A_n$ for $S=1$ and the determinant of $A_n$ for $S=-1$. 

The two-point correlators are then given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& G_{\alpha,\alpha'}^{(S)}(t) =
\langle\tilde{\Phi}_\alpha(x)\tilde{\Phi}_{\alpha'}(0)\rangle=
\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{(n!)^2\,(2\pi)^{2n}} \\ 
&& \int d\theta_1\dots d\theta_{n}d\beta_1\dots d\beta_{n} 
\,g_n^{(\alpha,\alpha')}(t\,|\theta_1,\dots,\beta_n)\,,
\end{eqnarray*}
where
\bea
&& g^{(\alpha,\alpha')}_n (t) = 
f_n^\alpha(\theta_1,\dots,\beta_n)f_n^{\alpha'}(\beta_n, \dots,\theta_1)\,
e^{-t e_n} \nonumber \\
&=& (S\sin\pi\alpha\,\sin\pi\alpha')^n\,
e^{(\alpha-\alpha')\sum_{i=1}^n(\theta_i-\beta_i)}\,\label{g}\\
&& \times \, 
\left|A_n\right|_{(S)}^2 \,e^{-t e_n}\,\,\,,
\nonumber 
\eea
and 
\[
t=m|x|\,\,\,\,\,\,\,,
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,
e_n=\sum_{k=1}^n (\cosh\theta_k + \cosh\beta_k)\,\,\,.
\]
Analogously to the procedure followed in \cite{BL}, we define
a new $n\times n$ matrix $M_n$ with entries
\bea
&& M_{ij}\equiv M(\theta_i,\beta_j)=
(\sin\pi\alpha\,\sin\pi\alpha')^{1/2}\,
e^{-\frac{t}{2}\cosh\theta_i}\,\nonumber \\
&& \times \frac{h(\theta_i)h^{-1}(\beta_j)}{\cosh\frac{\theta_i-\beta_j}{2}}\,
e^{-\frac{t}{2}\cosh\beta_j}\,\,\,,
\eea
where 
\[
h(\theta)=e^{(\alpha-\alpha')\,\theta/2}\,,
\]
and rewrite $g^{(\alpha,\alpha')}$ as
\EQ
g^{(\alpha,\alpha')}_n=S^n\left|M_n\right|^2_{(S)} =
\left|
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & M_n   \\
M_n^T  & 0 \\
\end{array}
\right|_{(S)}\,.
\EN
Finally we symmetrise with respect to the two sets of rapidities by 
introducing a charge index $\varepsilon$ which is $1$ for a particle $A$ 
and $-1$ for $\bar{A}$, so that we express the correlation functions 
as
\bea 
G_{\alpha,\alpha'}^{(S)}(t) & =& 
\sum_{L=0}^\infty\frac{1}{L!\,(2\pi)^L}\sum_{\epsilon_1\dots\epsilon_L}\int 
d\theta_1\dots d\theta_{L} \nonumber \\
& \times & \left|K_{\epsilon_i \epsilon_j}(\theta_i,\theta_j) 
\right|_{(S)}\,,
\label{fred}
\eea
where we have introduced the $L\times L$ matrices with entries
\bea
&& K_{+-}(\theta,\beta)=M(\theta,\beta)\,,\nonumber\\
&& K_{-+}(\theta,\beta)=M(\beta,\theta)\,, \label{pippo}\\
&& K_{++}(\theta,\beta)=K_{--}(\theta,\beta)=0\,\,\,.\nonumber
\eea
The last equation in (\ref{pippo}) ensures that only the terms with $L=2n$ 
occur in (\ref{fred}). Notice that the dependence on the statistics in 
(\ref{fred}) only reduces to taking the permanent or the determinant of 
the same matrix. According to the theory of Fredholm integral operators 
(see e.g.\,\cite{Schwinger}) the above expression is equal to 
\EQ
G_{\alpha,\alpha'}^{(S)}(t)=\textrm{Det}(1+2\pi\,{\bf K})^{-S}\,,
\EN
so that the correlators of operators having the same non-locality 
phase in the free fermion and free boson theories are the inverse 
of each other. This conclusion was first obtained in \cite{SMJ} 
studying the deformation theory of differential equations.
The result (\ref{main}) follows from the fact that the 
operators $V_\alpha(x)$ have a non-locality phase $e^{2i\pi\alpha}$ 
around the solitons at the sine-Gordon free fermion point (see 
e.g.\,\cite{af}), so that $\mu_j(x)$ and $V_{j/N}(x)$ have the same 
non-locality with respect to the corresponding particles. Since $j$ 
runs between $1$ and $N-1$, we are actually working with 
$0 <\alpha = j/N < 1$.

Once Eq.\,(\ref{main}) has been obtained by using the large 
distance expansion of the correlators, it is an interesting 
check to see how this inversion relation between the two correlators 
works in the short distance limit. Both in the bosonic and fermionic 
case the operators $\Phi_\alpha(x)$ satisfy the OPE 
\EQ
\langle\Phi_\alpha(x)\Phi_{\alpha'}(0)\rangle\sim |x|^{-
\Gamma^{(S)}_{\alpha,\alpha'}}\langle\Phi_{\alpha+\alpha'}\rangle+\dots\,,
\label{ope}
\EN
with
\EQ
\Gamma^{(S)}_{\alpha,\alpha'}=X^{(S)}_{\alpha}+X^{(S)}_{\alpha'}-
X^{(S)}_{\alpha+\alpha'}\,\,\,,
\EN
$X^{(S)}_\alpha$ being the scaling dimensions. In the bosonic case the 
index $\alpha+\alpha'$ is taken modulo $1$.
The scaling dimensions can be computed through the formula 
\cite{DSC}
\EQ
X_\alpha^{(S)}= -\frac{1}{2\pi}\int d^2x
\langle\Theta(x)\tilde{\Phi}_\alpha(0)\rangle_{connected}\,,
\EN
where $\Theta(x)$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Since the only
non-zero form factor of this operator in the free theories is
\EQ
\langle 0|\Theta(0)|A(\theta)\bar{A}(\beta)\rangle=2\pi m^2\left[-i
\sinh\frac{\theta-\beta}{2}\right]^{\delta_{S,-1}}\,,
\EN
one easily finds
\EQ
X^{(S)}_\alpha=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\alpha(1-\alpha)\,\,\, , & S=1 \\
\alpha^2\,\,\, , & S=-1 \\
\end{array}
\right.
\EN
in agreement with the conjugation properties $\mu_j^*=\mu_{N-j}$ and 
$V_\alpha^*=V_{-\alpha}$. These results coincide with those of conformal 
field theory with `twist' fields (see \cite{Dixon,AlZam}). It follows
\EQ
\Gamma^{(-)}_{\alpha,\alpha'}=-2\alpha\alpha'\,\,\, ,
\EN
\EQ
\Gamma^{(+)}_{\alpha,\alpha'}=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
2\alpha\alpha'\,, & \alpha+\alpha'<1 \\
2[\alpha\alpha'+1-(\alpha+\alpha')]\,, & \alpha+\alpha'>1\,\,\, . \\
\end{array}
\right.
\EN
The agreement for $1<\alpha+\alpha'<2$ is obtained by observing that in 
this range of $\alpha+\alpha'$, the leading short distance term in the 
fermionic case is not the one in (\ref{ope}) but the first off-critical 
contribution
\EQ
\mu/2\,\int d^2y\langle V_\alpha(x)V_\alpha(0)[V_1(y)+
V_{-1}(y)]\rangle_{\mu=0}\,\,\, ,
\label{off}
\EN
which indeed behaves as $|x|^{2[\alpha\alpha'+1-(\alpha+\alpha')]}$ when 
$x\rightarrow 0$.

In general, the two--point functions we are dealing with can be expressed as 
\EQ
G_{\alpha,\alpha'}^{(S)}(t)=e^{S\,\Upsilon_{\alpha,\alpha'}(t)}\,.
\label{newmain}
\EN
where $\Upsilon_{\alpha,\alpha'}(t)$ is given by 
\cite{SMJ,BL}
\bea
&& \Upsilon_{\alpha,\alpha'}(t)=\frac12\int_{t/2}^\infty\rho d\rho\,\times 
\label{Sigma}
\\
&& \times 
\left[(\partial_\rho\chi)^2-4\sinh^2\chi-
\frac{(\alpha-\alpha')^2}{\rho^2}\tanh\chi\right]\,,\nonumber 
\eea
with $\chi(\rho)$ satisfying the differential equation
\EQ
\partial^2_\rho\chi+\frac{1}{\rho}\,\partial_\rho\chi=2\sinh 2\chi+
\frac{(\alpha-\alpha')^2}{\rho^2}\,\tanh\chi\,(1-\tanh^2\chi) 
\label{diff}
\EN
with suitable boundary conditions.
The short distance behaviour for $\alpha+\alpha'<1$ is given by 
\EQ
\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}G_{\alpha,\alpha'}^{(S)}(t)=\left(C_{\alpha,\alpha'}\,
t^{2\alpha\alpha'}\right)^{-S}\,,
\label{uv}
\EN
with an amplitude that can be deduced from the work of 
Ref.\,\cite{russian1}
on vacuum expectation values in the sine-Gordon model:
\bea
&& C_{\alpha,\alpha'}=2^{-2\alpha\alpha'} \times 
\label{ampl} \\
&& \exp\left\{2\int_0^\infty\frac{dt}{t}
\left[\frac{\sinh\alpha t\,\cosh(\alpha+\alpha')t\,\sinh\alpha't}{\sinh^2t} + 
\nonumber \right. \right.\\
&&\left. \left. -\alpha\alpha'e^{-2t}\right]
\right\}\,.\nonumber 
\eea

Finally, let us discuss the case in which we have a $Z_2$ symmetry. 
This is somehow special since a broken phase with two degenerate 
vacua can be realised in terms of a {\em neutral} boson. In fact, 
a disorder operator with non-locality factor $-1$ is present also 
in the theory of a neutral bosonic free particle. It is easy to check 
that, for $S=1$ and $\alpha=1/2$, the form factors (\ref{solution}) 
imply the factorisation
\EQ
\mu_1=\mu_{(1)}\times\mu_{(2)}\,,\hspace{1cm}N=2
\EN
where $\mu_{(j)}$ is the disorder operator with scaling dimension 
$X^{(+)}_{1/2}/2=1/8$ associated to the neutral boson $A_j$ entering the 
decomposition $A=(A_1+iA_2)/\sqrt{2}$, $\bar{A}=(A_1-iA_2)/\sqrt{2}$.

The fermion-boson correspondence observed above for charged particles has 
an analogue in the neutral case, and the correlation function
\EQ
G(t)=\langle\tilde{\mu}_{(j)}(x)\tilde{\mu}_{(j)}(0)\rangle=
\left[G^{(+)}_{1/2,1/2}(t)\right]^{1/2}
\label{neutral}
\EN
can be related to correlators computed in the theory of a free neutral 
fermion, i.e. in the Ising field theory without magnetic field. To see 
this, let us recall that the correlators of the spin and disorder operators in the 
unbroken phase of the scaling Ising model can be written as \cite{McCoyWu}
\bea
&& \tau_\pm(t)\equiv \langle\tilde{\mu}(x)\tilde{\mu}(0)\rangle\pm
                \langle\sigma(x)\sigma(0)\rangle= \\
&& = \exp\left[\pm\frac12 \chi(t/2)-\frac12 \Upsilon_{1/2,1/2}(t)\right]\,,
\nonumber 
\eea
where the functions $\chi$ and $\Upsilon$ are those of 
Eqs.\,(\ref{Sigma}), (\ref{diff}). Hence, it follows from (\ref{newmain}) 
and (\ref{neutral}) that
\EQ
G(t)=[\tau_+(t)\tau_-(t)]^{-1/2}\,.
\EN
Concerning the short distance behaviour of this correlator, the power law
(\ref{uv}) acquires in this case a logarithmic correction due to the 
`resonance' with the leading off-critical contribution (\ref{off}). Such 
a contribution to the correlator $\langle\tilde{V}_\alpha(x)
\tilde{V}_\alpha(0)\rangle$ behaves as $-C_{\alpha,\alpha}t^{1/2}
[1+(2-4\alpha)\ln t]$ in the limit 
$\alpha\rightarrow 1/2$, so that
\EQ
\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}G_{1/2,1/2}^{(-)}(t)=
\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}G^{-2}(t) = {\cal B}\,t^{1/2}\ln(1/t)\,,
\EN
with
\EQ
{\cal B} = - 4\,\mbox{Res}_{\alpha=1/2}\,C_{\alpha,\alpha}=0.588353..\,\,.
\EN
and this amplitude coincides with that of the product 
$\tau_+(t)\tau_-(t)$ in the Ising model.

The considerations of this section have recently been extended to the case
of massive ghost theories \cite{DMM}. In all these cases the  
correlation functions of disorder operators can be computed exactly for free
theories and are related to the same differential equation 
(\ref{diff}). In absence of interaction, the correlators are non-trivial due
to the non-locality between the operators and the particles. 
The resummation of the spectral series for interacting theories remains a 
challanging task even in presence of integrability.

\section{Non-integrable Deformations}

The free bosonic and fermionic theories discussed above can also be regarded 
as describing phases of spontaneously broken $Z_N$ symmetry. In this dual
vision, the excitations are free kinks $|K_{j,j\pm 1}(\theta)\rangle$ 
interpolating between two adjacent vacua $|0_j\rangle$ and 
$|0_{j\pm 1}\rangle$ (the indices are taken modulo $N$). Let us denote by 
$\Phi_{k/N}$, $k=0,1,\dots,N-1$, the operators we are interested in. They 
correspond to the exponential operators $V_{k/N}$ in the fermionic 
case\footnote{In this case the N degenerate vacua can be identified with 
those of the periodic potential in (\ref{sg}) identified modulo N.}, and 
to the operators $\sigma_k$, dual to the disorder operators $\mu_k$, in 
the bosonic case. These operators create multikink excitations with 
zero topologic charge, i.e. starting and ending in the same vacuum state. 
Form factors on kink states were discussed in \cite{CDperco}. Consider 
for the sake of simplicity the two-kink matrix elements
\EQ
F_{j,k}^\pm(\theta_1-\theta_2)\equiv
\langle 0_j|\Phi_{k/N}(0)|K_{j,j\pm 1}(\theta_1)
K_{j\pm 1,j}(\theta_2)\rangle\,,
\label{ffkinks}
\EN
satisfying the equations 
\begin{eqnarray*}
F_{j,k}^\pm(\theta) & = & S\,F_{j,k}^\mp(-\theta)\,, \\
F_{j,k}^\pm(\theta+2i\pi) &=& F_{j\pm 1,k}^\mp(-\theta)\,, 
\\
\textrm{Res}_{\theta=i\pi}F_{j,k}^\pm(\theta) & = & 
i\,\left[\langle 0_j|\Phi_{k/N}|0_j\rangle + \right. \\
&& \left.  -\langle 0_{j\pm 
1}|\Phi_{k/N}|0_{j\pm 1}
\rangle \right]\,\,\, .
\end{eqnarray*}
Since the generator $\Omega$ of $Z_N$ transformations ($\Omega^N=1$) acts 
on states and operators as ($\omega\equiv e^{2i\pi/N}$)
\bea
&& \Omega\,|K_{j,j+1}(\theta_1)K_{j+1,j+2}(\theta_2)\dots\rangle 
= \nonumber \\
&& = |K_{j+1,j+2}(\theta_1)K_{j+2,j+3}(\theta_2)\dots\rangle\,,
\nonumber \\
&&  \Omega^{-1}\,\Phi_{k/N}(x)\,\Omega  = \omega^k\,\Phi_{k/N}(x)\,,
\nonumber 
\eea
the above form factor equations can be rewritten as 
\bea
F_{j,k}^\pm(\theta+2i\pi) &=& S\,\omega^{\pm k}F_{j,k}^\pm(\theta)\,, 
\nonumber \\
\textrm{Res}_{\theta=i\pi}F_{j,k}^\pm(\theta) & = & 
i\,(1-\omega^{\pm k})\langle 0_j|\Phi_{k/N}|0_j\rangle\,.\nonumber 
%\label{residue}
\eea
Once the identifications $A\longleftrightarrow 
K_{i,i+1}$, $\bar{A}\longleftrightarrow K_{i,i-1}$ are made,
these relations are equivalent to the previous equations for the 
Form Factors with $n=1$. This correspondence is easily extended 
to all values of $n$ and leads to the same form factors 
and correlation functions discussed for the unbroken phase. 

The introduction of a `magnetic field' pointing in the $k$ direction and
breaking explicitely the $Z_N$ symmetry corresponds to adding to the free 
action a term
\EQ
h\int d^2x\,\Psi_k(x)\,,
\EN
where 
\EQ
\Psi_k(x) = \frac{1}{N}\,\sum_{l=0}^{N-1}\omega^{-kl}\,
\Phi_{l/N}(x)\,\,\,. 
\EN
The first 
order corrections to the energy density $\varepsilon_j$ of the vacuum 
state $|0_j\rangle$ and to the mass $m_{j,j\pm 1}$ of the kink 
$K_{j,j\pm 1}$ can be computed according to the Form Factor 
Perturbation Theory proposed in \cite{DMS}
\bea
&& \delta\varepsilon_j\sim h\,\langle 0_j|\Psi_k|0_j\rangle=h\,v\,\delta_{j,k}
\,,\nonumber \\
&& \delta m_{j,j\pm 1}^2\sim h\,\langle 0_j|\Psi_k(0)|K_{j,j\pm 1}(i\pi)
K_{j\pm 1,j}(0)\rangle\,.\nonumber 
\eea
It follows from the residue equation written above that 
\bea
&& \textrm{Res}_{\theta=i\pi}\langle 0_j|\Psi_k(0)|K_{j,j\pm 1}(\theta)
K_{j\pm 1,j}(0)\rangle = \nonumber 
\\
&& \frac{iv}{N}\left(\delta_{j,k}-\delta_{j,k\mp 1}
\right)\,, 
\eea
This formula implies that the correction to the mass of the kinks 
interpolating between the vacua $|0_k\rangle$ and $|0_{k\pm 1}\rangle$ 
is infinite. This divergence simply reflects the fact that these kinks 
become unstable because the magnetic field removes the degeneracy of 
the vacuum $|0_k\rangle$ with the two adjacent vacua. These kinks 
are then confined in pairs $K_{k,k\pm 1}K_{k\pm 1,k}$ and the 
confinement gives rise to a string of bound states with zero 
topologic charge, as discussed in more details in \cite{msg}.
