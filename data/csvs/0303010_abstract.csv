    Hydrodynamic fluctuations
    at non-zero temperature can cause slow
    relaxation toward equilibrium even in observables which
    are not locally conserved.
    A classic example is the stress-stress correlator in a normal fluid,
    which, at zero wavenumber, behaves at large times as $t^{-3/2}$.
    A novel feature of the effective theory of
    hydrodynamic fluctuations in supersymmetric theories
    is the presence of Grassmann-valued classical fields
    describing macroscopic supercharge density fluctuations.
    We show that
    hydrodynamic fluctuations in supersymmetric theories
    generate essentially the same long-time power-law tails
    in real-time correlation functions that are known in simple fluids.
    In particular, a $t^{-3/2}$ long-time tail must exist in
    the stress-stress correlator of
    $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at non-zero temperature,
    regardless of the value of the coupling.
    Consequently, this feature of finite-temperature dynamics
    can provide an interesting test of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
    However, the coefficient of this long-time tail is
    suppressed by a factor of $1/\Nc^2$.
    On the gravitational side, this implies that these long-time tails
    are not present in the classical supergravity limit;
    they must instead be produced by one-loop gravitational fluctuations.
