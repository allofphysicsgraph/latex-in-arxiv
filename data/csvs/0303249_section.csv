\begin{appendix}
\section{Field theory conventions}

Here we present the propagators necessary for evaluating the
correlation functions in section \ref{anom_dim}. The toy dQFT consists
of the $d=4$ fermions $\lambda_{im}$ and the defect fields $\Psi^i$,
$q^m$, ($i,m=1,2$).  We are not careful about whether the indices $m$,
$i$ are raised or lowered, but move them around for notational
convenience. We use the spinor conventions of \cite{dfo}.

The $\Psi^i$ and $q^m$ are complex.  The $\lambda_{im}$ are composed
of Majorana fields $\lambda$, $\chi^A$, $A = 1,2,3$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_{im} \equiv \lambda \delta_{im} - i \chi^A \sigma^A_{im} \,,
\quad \quad  \bar\lambda_{mi} \equiv \bar\lambda \delta_{mi} + i \bar\chi^A
\sigma^A_{mi} \,,
\end{eqnarray}
and the kinetic terms for the $\lambda$, $\chi^A$ are canonical:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{LambdaKin}
-\tf{i}{4} \bar\lambda^{mi} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \lambda^{im} =
-\tf{i}{2} \bar\lambda \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \lambda -\tf{i}{2}
\bar\chi^A \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \chi^A \,.
\end{eqnarray}
The action (\ref{Action}) has three continuous symmetries, the defect
$U(1)_B$, under which $q$ and $\Psi$ both have charge 1, and $SU(2)_V
\times SU(2)_H$ (acting on the indices $i$ and $m$, respectively),
under which $\Psi \rightarrow g_V \Psi$, $q \rightarrow g_H q$, and
$\lambda \rightarrow g_V \lambda g_H^\dagger$, with $T^A = \sigma^A/2$
the generators of $SU(2)$, leading to the currents (\ref{currents}).

We now consider the propagators, rotated to Euclidean space.  For
$\lambda_{im}$, one processes the $SU(2)_V \times SU(2)_H$ indices
according to
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
\langle \lambda_{im}(z_1) \, \bar\lambda_{nj}(z_2) \rangle &=&  2 \langle 
\lambda(z_1) \, \bar\lambda(z_2) \rangle \delta_{ij} \delta_{mn} \,, \\
\label{FlavorProp}
\langle \lambda_{im}(z_1) \, \lambda_{jn}(z_2) \rangle &=&  2 \langle 
\lambda(z_1) \, \lambda(z_2) \rangle \epsilon_{ij} \epsilon_{mn} \,, \\
\langle \bar\lambda_{mi}(z_1) \, \bar\lambda_{nj}(z_2) \rangle &=&  2 \langle 
\bar\lambda(z_1) \, \bar\lambda(z_2) \rangle \epsilon_{ij} \epsilon_{mn} \,,
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where we suppressed spinor indices; the propagators on the right-hand
side those of an ordinary Majorana particle, evaluated below.  In
evaluating the above we used the Pauli matrix identity:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma^A_{ij} \sigma^A_{kl} = \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl} - 2
\epsilon_{ik} \epsilon_{jl} = 2 \delta_{il} \delta_{jk} - 
\delta_{ij} \delta_{kl} \,.
\end{eqnarray}
The massless 4D and 3D scalar propagators
are:\footnote{Of course there is no field $X$ in this model, but it is
nonetheless useful to define the 4D scalar propagator.}
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle X(z_1) \, \bar{X}(z_2) \rangle \equiv \Delta_{12} =  
{1 \over 4 \pi^2} {
1 \over (z_{12})^2} \,, \quad \quad
\langle q(y_1) \, \bar{q}(y_2) \rangle \equiv \delta_{12} =  
{1 \over 4 \pi} {1 
\over |y_{12}|} \,.
\end{eqnarray}
The massless 4D Fermi propagator is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle \lambda(z_1) \, \bar{\lambda}(z_2) \rangle \equiv
S_{12} = \gamma^\mu\partial_\mu \Delta_{12}  \,.
\end{eqnarray}
Since $\lambda$ is Majorana, we also have nonvanishing $\langle
\lambda_{\alpha a}(z_1) \, \lambda_{\beta b} (z_2) \rangle$ and
$\langle \bar\lambda_{\alpha a}(z_1) \, \bar\lambda_{\beta b}(z_2)
\rangle$, determined by $\bar\lambda = \lambda^T \gamma^0$.
The massless 3D Fermi propagator is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle \Psi (y_1) \, \bar{\Psi} (y_2) \rangle \equiv 
s_{12} = \rho^k  \partial_k \, \delta_{12} \,,
\end{eqnarray}
which can be written as in a 4D notation as
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{PsiProp}
\langle \Psi^i(z_1) \bar\Psi^j(z_2) \rangle = \delta^{ij}
(\gamma^k P_+)  \,\partial_k \delta_{12} \equiv \delta^{ij}
\hat{s}_{12} \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where we define the projection matrices $P_\pm$ 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{ProjectionMatrices}
P_\pm \equiv \tf12 \left( 1 \pm \gamma^5 \gamma^x \right) \,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\gamma^5 \equiv -i \gamma^0 \gamma^1 \gamma^2 \gamma^x$ is the
chirality matrix. The projection matrices (\ref{ProjectionMatrices}) obey
\begin{eqnarray}
[P_\pm , \gamma^k ] = 0 \,, \quad  \gamma^x P_\pm = P_\mp \gamma^x \,, \quad 
P_+^2 = P_-^2 = 1 \,, \quad P_+ P_- = 0 \,.
\end{eqnarray}
