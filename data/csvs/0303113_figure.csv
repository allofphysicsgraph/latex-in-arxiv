  \caption{\it Relations between groups associated to the 3D Class A
    Lie algebras. The boxes give the groups and the components
    $\mathsf{Q}^{mn} = \tfrac{1}{2} \text{diag}(q_1,q_2,q_3)$ of the
    structure constants. The arrows give the operations: the dashed
    arrow corresponds to the reversible analytic continuation, the
    solid arrow to the irreversible group contraction. These analytic
    continuations and contractions are defined in \eqref{C7} and
    \eqref{C8}.} \label{3Drelations}
