  We give an introduction to a 
  new approach to the covariant quantization of superstrings. 
  After a brief review of the classical Green--Schwarz 
  superstring and Berkovits' approach to its quantization based on 
  pure spinors, we discuss our covariant formulation without pure spinor 
  constraints. We discuss the relation between the concept of grading, 
  which we introduced to define vertex operators, and 
  homological perturbation theory, and we compare our work with recent 
  work by others. In the appendices, 
  we include some background material for the Green-Schwarz and 
  Berkovits formulations, in order that this presentation be self 
  contained.

\section{Introduction} 
String theory is mostly based on the Ramond--Neveu--Schwarz (RNS) 
formulation, with worldsheet fermions $\psi^m$ in the vector 
representation of the spacetime Lorentz group $SO(9,1)$. This 
formulation exhibits classically a $N=1$ local supersymmetry of the 
worldsheet.  The BRST symmetry of the RNS formulation is based on the 
super-reparametrization invariance of the worldsheet. The fundamental 
fields are the bosons $x^m$, the fermions $\psi^m$, the 
reparametrization ghosts $b_{zz}, c^z$ and the superghosts $\beta_{\small {z \sqrt{z}}}, 
\g^{\small \sqrt{z}}$. Physical states correspond to vertex operators which {i)} belong 
to the BRST cohomology and {ii)} are annihilated by the zero mode $b_0$ of the 
antighost for the open string, or by $b_0$ and $\tilde b_0$ for the closed string.  To obtain 
a set of physical states which form a representation of spacetime 
supersymmetry, the GSO projection is applied to remove half of the 
physical states. Spacetime supersymmetry is thus not manifest, and the 
study of Ramond-Ramond backgrounds is not feasible. Therefore, one 
would prefer a formulation with spacetime fermions $\t^\a$ belonging 
to a representation of $Spin(9,1)$ because it would keep spacetime 
supersymmetry (susy) manifest. 

At the classical level, such a 
formulation was constructed by Green and Schwarz in 1984 
\GreenSchwarz. Their classical action contains two fermions 
$\t^{i\a}$ ($i=1,2$) and the bosonic coordinates $x^m$. Each of the 
$\t$'s is real and can be chiral or anti-chiral (type IIA/B 
superstrings): they are $16$-component Majorana-Weyl spinors which are 
spacetime spinors and worldsheet scalars. We denote chiral 
spinors by contravariant indices $\t^\a$ with $\a=1,\dots,16$; 
antichiral spinors are denoted by $\t_\a$, also with $\a=1,\dots,16$. 
We shall only consider chiral $\t$'s below.  

The rigid spacetime supersymmetry is given by the usual non-linear 
coordinate representation 
\ahin{susyA}{\d_\e \t^{i\a} = \e^{i\a}\,, ~~~~~ 
\d_\e x^m = \bar\e^i \G^m \t^i = i\, \e^{i \a} \g^m_{\a\b} \t^{i \b}\,,} 
where $\g^m_{\a\b}$ are  ten real symmetric $16\times16$ matrices and the 
flavor indices $i=1,2$ are summed over. (In appendix A, Dirac matrices and 
Majorana-Weyl spinors are reviewed). 
Susy-invariant building blocks are 
\ahin{susyB}{\Pi^m_\mu \equiv \p_\mu x^m - 
i \t^i \g^m \p_\mu \t^i\,, ~~~~~ \p_\mu \t^{i\a}\,} where $\mu=0,1$ 
and $\p_0 = \p_t$ and $\p_1 = \p_\s$. A natural choice for the action 
on a flat background spacetime and curved worldsheet would seem to be 
\ahin{susyC}{{\cal L}_1 = -\frac {1}{ 2  \pi} \, \sqrt{-h} \, 
h^{\mu\nu} \eta_{mn} \, \Pi^m_\mu \Pi^n_\nu\,, } 
with $h^{\m\n}$ the worldsheet metric, 
because it is the susy-invariant line element (a natural generalization of the 
action for the bosonic string). However, it yields no kinetic term for the fermions. Even if 
one could produce a kinetic term, there would still be the problem that one would have 
${\frac 1 2 }(16+16) = 16$ fermionic propagating modes and $8$ bosonic 
propagating modes. Such a theory could not yield a linear representation of supersymmetry. 
 
A resolution of this problem became possible when Siegel found a new 
local fermionic symmetry ($\k$-symmetry) for the point particle 
%\SiegelHH 
\cite{SiegelHH}. 
Green and Schwarz tried to find this symmetry in their string, and they discovered 
that it is present, but only after adding a Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten 
term to the action. Using this symmetry one could impose the gauge 
$\G^+ \t^1 = \G^+ \t^2 =0$ (where $\G^\pm = \G^0 \pm \G^9$), and if 
one then also fixed the local scale and general coordinate symmetry by 
$h^{\mu \nu } = \eta^{\mu\nu}$, and the remaining conformal symmetry by 
$x^+(\s,t) = x^+_0 + p^+ t$, the action became a free string theory with $8$ 
fermionic degrees of freedom and $8$ bosonic degrees of freedom. Susy 
was linearly realized and quantization posed no problem. 
 
However, in this combined $\k$-light cone gauge, manifest $SO(9,1)$ 
Lorentz invariance is lost, and with it all the reasons for studying the 
superstring in the first place. (We shall call the string of 
Green and Schwarz the superstring, to distinguish it from the RNS 
string which we call the spinning string.) 
 
Going back to the original classical action, it was soon 
realized that second class constraints were present, due to the 
definition of the conjugate momenta of the $\t$'s. These second class 
constraints could be handled by decomposing them w.r.t. a non-compact 
$SU(5)$ subgroup of $SO(9,1)$ (see appendix D) , but then again 
manifest Lorentz invariance was lost. An approach to quantization 
which could deal with second class constraints and keep covariance 
was needed. By using a 
proposal of Faddeev and Fradkin, one could 
turn second class constraints into first class constraints by adding further fields, 
but upon quantization one now obtained an infinite set of ghosts-for-ghosts, and 
problems with the calculation of anomalies were encountered. At the end 
of the 80's, several authors tried different approaches, but they always 
encountered infinite sets of ghosts-for-ghosts, and 15 years of pain 
followed \superstring. 
 
A few years ago Berkovits developed a new line of thought \berko. 
Taking a flat background and a flat worldsheet metric, 
the central charge $c$ in one sector\footnote{One $\t$ is always left-moving and the other $\t$ is 
always right-moving, whether or not they have the same chirality.} 
of 10 free bosons $x^m$ and one $\t$ is 
$c =10 - 2 \times 16 =-22$ 
(there is a conjugate momentum $p_{z\a}$ for $\t^\a$). He noted 
that if one decomposes a chiral spinor $\l^\a$ under the 
non-compact $SU(5)$ subgroup of $SO(9,1)$, it decomposes as 
$\underline{16} \rightarrow 
\underline{10}+\underline{5}^*+\underline{1}$ (see Appendix~D). 
Imposing the constraint 
\ahin{pure}{\l^T \g^m \l = 0\,,} 
also known as {\it pure spinor constraint}, 
one can express the $\underline{5}^*$ in terms of the $\underline{10}$ 
and $\underline{1}$, and hence it seemed that by adding a commuting 
pure spinor (with conjugate momenta for the $\underline{10}$ 
and $\underline{1}$), one could obtain vanishing central charge: 
$c = 10_x - 2 \times 16_{\t,p_\t} + 2 \times (10 +1)_{\l, p_\l} = 0$. In 
the past few years, he has developed this approach further. 
 
Having a constraint such as (\ref{pure})~in a theory 
leads to problems at the quantum level in the computation of loop 
corrections and in the definition of the path integral. A similar situation 
occurred in superspace formulations of supergravity, where one must impose constraints 
on the supertorsions; in that case the constraints were solved and the 
covariance was sacrificed. One could work only with $\underline{10}$ and 
$\underline{1}$, but then one would again violate manifest Lorentz 
invariance. 
 
We have developed an approach 
\Grassi~which starts with the same 
$\t^\a, p_{z\a}$ 
and $\l^\a$ as used by Berkovits, but we relax the constraint (\ref{pure})~by 
adding new ghosts. In Berkovits' and our approach one has the BRST 
law $s\, \t^\a = i \l^\a$, with real $\t^\a$, but in Berkovits' approach $\l^\a$ 
must be complex in order that (\ref{pure})~have a solution at all, 
{\it whereas in our approach $\l^\a$ is real}. 
The law $s \t^\a = i\, \l^\a$ is an enormous simplification over the law one would 
obtain from the $\kappa$-symmetry law $\delta_\kappa \t^\a = \Pi^m_\mu (\g_m \k^\mu)^\a$ 
with selfdual $\k^{\mu}_\beta$. It is this simpler starting point that avoids the 
infinite set of ghosts-for-ghosts. Perhaps our finite set of fields corresponds to 
resummations of the infinite set of fields 
encountered in previous approaches. 
First, we give a brief review of the classical superstring action from which 
we shall only extract a set of first class constraints $d_{z\a}$. These first 
class constraints are removed from the action and used to construct a BRST charge. 
 
We deduce the full theory 
by requiring nilpotency of the BRST charge: each time nilpotency on a given field 
does not hold we add a new field (ghost) and define its BRST transformation 
rule such that nilpotency holds.  A priori, one might expect that one would end up again with an 
infinite set of ghosts-for-ghosts, but to our happy surprise the iteration procedure 
stops after a finite number of steps. 
 
In some modern approaches the difference between the action and the BRST charge becomes 
less clear (in the BV formalism the action is even equal to the BRST charge, and 
in string field theory the action is expressed in terms of the BRST charge). So the 
transplantation of the first class constraints from the action to the BRST charge may not be as 
drastic as it may sound at first. We may in this way create a different off-shell formulation of the 
same physical theory. The great advantage of this procedure is that one is left with a free 
action, so that propagators become very easy to write down, and OPE's among vertex operators 
become as easy as in the RNS approach. 
 
We shall now present our approach. We have a new definition of physical states, 
and we obtain the correct spectrum for the open string as well as for the closed 
superstring, both at the massless level and at the massive levels. Since these 
notes are intended as introduction to our work, we give much background material 
in the appendices. Such material is not present in our papers, but 
may help to understand the reasons and the technical aspects of our approach. 
Our approach differs from the conventional approaches to the BRST quantization of strings. 
One would therefore like to see it work in a simpler example. For that reason we have applied 
our ideas to pure Yang-Mills field theory \GrassiSR. One gets also in that case the 
correct cohomology. 

We have found since the conference some deep geometrical meanings of the new ghosts, but we have 
not yet found the underlying classical action to which our quantum theory corresponds. Sorokin, Tonin and 
collaborators have recently shown \tonin~how one can obtain Berkovits' theory 
from a $N=(2,0)$ worldsheet action with superdiffeomorphism embeddings, and it is possible 
that a similar approach yields our theory. 
 
\section{The classical Green-Schwarz action} 
 
As we already mentioned, a natural generalization of the bosonic string with ${\cal L} \sim (\p_\a x^m)^2$ with 
spacetime supersymmetry is the supersymmetric line element given in \susyB~and \susyC. 
If one considers the interaction term $\p_\mu x^m (\t \g_m \p^\m \t)$ and if 
one chooses the light cone gauge $x^+ = x^+_0 + p^+ t$ one obtains a term 
$p^+ \t \g_+ \p_t \t= (\sqrt{p^+} \t) \g_+ \p_t (\sqrt{p^+} \t)$. This is not a satisfactory 
kinetic term because we also would need a term with $ p^+ \t \g_+ \p_\s \t$. Such a term 
would be obtained if the action contains a term of the form $ (\p_t x^+) \t \g_+ \p_\s \t$, or in covariant 
notation $\e^{\m\n} (\p_\m x^m) \t \g_m \p_\n \t$. 
The extra kinetic term  $\e^{\m\n} \p_\m x^m \t \g_m \p_\n \t$ is part of a Wess-Zumino term 
(see appendix B). 
 
Rigid susy \susyA~and $\d_\e (\p_\s x^+) = 0$ 
would lead to $\e \g^+ \p_\s \t =0$. This suggests that the light-cone gauge for $\t$ 
should read $\g^+ \t =0$, or, in terms of $32 \times 32$ matrices, $\Gamma^+ \t =0$. 
If $\Gamma^+ \t =0$, also $\t^T C \Gamma^+=0$, and inserting 
$\{\Gamma^+, \Gamma^-\} = 1$, one would also 
find that $\t^T C \Gamma^I \p_\s \t =0$ for $I=1, \dots, 8$. So, then we would find in the light cone gauge 
that the action for $\t$ becomes a free action, a good starting point for string theory at the 
quantum level. 
 
In order that these steps are correct, we would need a local fermionic symmetry which would justify 
the gauge $\Gamma^+ \t =0$.  Pursuing this line of thought, one arrives then at the 
crucial question: does the sum of the supersymmetric line element and the WZNW term contain a new fermionic 
symmetry with half as many parameters as there are $\t$ components ? The answer is affirmative, and the 
$\k$-symmetry is briefly discussed at the end of appendix B, but since we shall not need the explicit form of 
the $\kappa$ symmetry transformation laws, we do not give them. 
 
The superstring action is very complicated already in a flat background. We extract from it a set of 
first class constraints $d_{z\a}= 0$, from which we build the BRST charge, and at all stages we work with a 
free action. 
%Since action and BRST charge are closely related (for example in the BV formalism the action {\it is} 
%the BRST charge) it may not be too drastic to transfer informations (the constraints $d_\a$) from the 
%classical action to the BRST charge. Starting with a free action and a BRST charge which contains the relevant 
%information on the dynamics ($d_\a$)  might lead to a different off-shell formulation with the same 
%physical content. 
The precise way to obtain $d_{z\a}$ from the classical superstring action is discussed in appendix~C.

\section{Determining the theory from  the nilpotency of the BRST charge} 
 
We now start our program of determining the theory 
(the BRST charge and the ghost content) by requiring 
nilpotency of the BRST transformations. We consider one $\t$ for 
simplicity (we have also extended 
our work to two $\t$'s \GrassiXF). 
We shall be careful (for once) with aspects such as reality and normalizations. 
The BRST transformations preserve reality and are generated by $\Lambda Q$ where $\Lambda$ 
is imaginary and anti-commuting. It then follows that $Q$ should also be antihermitian in order that 
$\Lambda\, Q$ be antihermitian. For any field, we define 
the $s$ transformations as BRST transformations without $\Lambda$, 
so $\d_B \Phi = [\Lambda Q, \Phi]$ and $s \Phi = [Q, \Phi]_{\pm}$. 
The $s$-transformations have reality properties 
which follow from the BRST transformations (which preserve reality). 
 
We begin with 
\ahin{BRSTA}{Q = \int i \l^\a d_{z\a}\,,} 
where $d_{z\a}$ is given in Appendix C and 
$\int = {\frac {1}{ 2 i \pi}} \oint dz$. This Q is indeed antihermitian because $d_{z \a}$ is 
antihermitian. (We have performed a Wick rotation in appendix C, in order to be able to use the conventional tools 
of conformal field theory, but the reality properties hold in Minkowski space). 
The BRST operator depends on Heisenberg fields which satisfy the field 
equations, and since we work with a free action, $\bar\p \l^\a =0$ and $\bar\p d_{z\a} =0$ so that 
in flat space $\l^\a d_{z \a}$ is a holomorphic current, namely 
$\bar\p (\l^\a d_{z \a}) = 0$. 
%This property is crucial for the construction of non-linear 
%sigma models. 
 
The field $d_{z\a}$ contains a term $p_{z\a}$, where $p_{z\a}$ is the 
momentum conjugate to $\t^\a$ and it is antihermitian since $p_{z\a}$ 
is antihermitian as can be seen from the action $\int d^2z p_{z\a} \bar\p \t$. 
The factor ${\frac 1 2}$ in  $d_{z\a}$ in eq. \GSC\ 
can be checked by noting that the OPE\foot{The OPE of $d_\a$ with $d_\b$ is evaluated 
using $\p x^m(z) \p x^n(w) \sim - \eta^{mn} (z-w)^{-2}$ and $p_{z\a}(z) \t^\b (w) \sim \d_\a^{~~\b} (z-w)^{-1}.$} 
of $d_\a$ with $d_\b$ be proportional to $\Pi^m_w$. The expression for $\Pi^m_z$ is real and fixed by spacetime 
susy. 
 
The operators $d_{z\a}$ generate a closed algebra of currents with a central charge 
\ahin{BRSTB}{ 
d_\a(z) d_\b(w) \sim  2 i {\frac{\g^m_{\a\b}\Pi_m(w)}{z-w}}\,, 
~~~~~~~ 
d_\a(z) \Pi^m(w) \sim - 2 i {\frac{\g^m_{\a\b}\p\t^\b(w)} {z-w}}\,, 
} 
$$ 
\Pi^m(z) \Pi^n(w) \sim - \frac{ 1}{(z-w)^2} \eta^{mn}\,,~~~~~~~ 
    d_\a(z) \t^\b(w) \sim {\frac 1 {z-w}} \delta^{~\b}_{\a}\,. 
$$ 
 
Acting with \BRSTA~on $\t^\a$, one obtains 
$s \t^\a = i \l^\a$, and acting on $\l^\a$  yields $s \l^\a =0$. Nilpotency 
on $\t^\a$ and $\l^\a$ is achieved. 
Repeating this procedure on $x^m$ 
gives $s x^m = \l \g^m \t$, but since $s^2 x^m = i \l \g^m \l$ 
does not vanish, we introduce a new real anticommuting ghost $\xi^m$ by setting 
$s\,  x^m = \l \g^m \t + \xi^m$ and choosing the BRST transformation law of 
$\xi^m$ such that the nilpotency on $x^m$ is obtained. This leads to 
$s \xi^m = - i \l \g^m\l$. Nilpotency on $x^m$ is now achieved, but $s$ 
has acquired an extra 
term\foot{Spacetime susy requires that $Q'$ depends on $\Pi^m_z$ 
instead of, for example $\p_z x^m$.} 
$Q' = - \int \xi^m \Pi_{z m}$ where we recall $\Pi^m_z  = 
\p_z x^m - i \t \g^m \p_z \t$. Nilpotency on $p_{z\a}$, or 
equivalently on $d_{z\a}$, is obtained by further 
modifying the sum of 
$Q d_{z\a} = 
- 2 \Pi^m_z (\g_m \l)_\a$ and 
$ Q' d_{z \a} = - 2 i \xi^m (\g_m \p_z \t)_\a$ 
by adding 
$Q''  d_{z \a} = %- 2 \Pi^m_z (\g_m \l)_\a -2 i \xi^m (\g_m \p_z 
                 %\t)_\a + 
\p_z\chi_\a$ and fixing the BRST law of $\chi_\a$ such that nilpotency on 
$d_{z\a}$ is achieved.\foot{Since $(Q+Q')^2 d_{z\a} = \p_z( -2 \xi^m \g_m \l) _\a$, 
we add a term $\p_z \chi_\a$ instead of a field $\chi_{z\a}$.} 
This yields $Q \chi_\a = 2\xi^m (\g_m \l)_\a$ 
and $Q^2 \chi_\a =0$ due to a Fierz rearrangement involving three 
chiral spinors (see eq.~(\ref{ccccc})). At this point we have achieved nilpotency on $\t^\a, 
x^m, d_{z\a}$ and $\l^\a, \xi^m, \chi_\a$. We introduce the antighosts 
$w_{z\a}, \b_{z m}, \k^\a_z$ for the ghosts $\l^\a, \xi^m, \chi_\a$ and 
find that $s \Phi = [Q, \Phi\}"
