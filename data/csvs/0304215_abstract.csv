     When the interaction potential is suitably reordered, the
     Moyal field theory admits two types of  Galilean symmetries,
     namely the conventional mass-parameter-centrally-extended
     one with commuting boosts, but also
     the two-fold centrally extended ``exotic'' Galilean symmetry,
     where the commutator of the boosts yields the noncommutative
     parameter.
     In the free case, one gets an ``exotic''
     two-parameter central extension of the Schr\""odinger group.
     The conformal symmetry is, however, broken by the interaction.
