The spectrum and degeneracies of the Dirac operator are analysed
on compact coset spaces when there is a non-zero homogeneous 
background gauge field
which is compatible with the symmetries of the space, in particular
when the gauge field is derived from the spin-connection.
It is shown how the degeneracy of the lowest Landau level
in the recently proposed higher dimensional quantum Hall effect
is related to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for
the Dirac operator on a compact coset space.
