\section{Raising the Scale for a Single Massless Graviton 
\label{appproof}}
In this appendix it we show that a theory with a single
massive graviton must break down by $\Lambda_3$. We demonstrate
this by considering all possible extensions to the Fierz-Pauli
Lagrangian and calculating of all the
tree level amplitudes which must cancel. Because of subtleties
with a possible non-linearly realized $U(1)$ invariance,
this brute-force approach proves to be more convincing than
possible symmetry based arguments.

Start with the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
{\cal L}_{\rm F P}
= \sqrt{g} R ( g ) + \frac{1}{4} ( [h^2] - [h]^2 )
\end{equation}
The strongest diagrams generated by this Lagrangian blow up
at $\Lambda_5$, but there are also diagrams which get strong at $\Lambda_4$
and $\Lambda_3$. More explicitly,
for
diagrams with four external lines, the $\Lambda_5$ is scalar
scattering through scalar exchange; $\Lambda_4$ is scalar
scattering; and $\Lambda_3$ is either 
vector scattering through scalar
exchange or scalar vector scattering. 
In general, 
vector exchange contributes at the same order as the corresponding
quartic vertex.

The only terms which may help cancel these tree-level scattering processes
are cubic and quartic in $h$:
%To raise this scale, we can consider adding the following
%due to scattering of the scalar modes of $h$. We can add the following 
%cubic and quartic extensions:
\begin{equation}
\Delta {\cal L} = c_1 [h^3] + c_2 [h^2] [h] + c_3 [h]^3 + q_1 [h^4] + q_2 [h^2] [h^2]
+ q_3 [h^3] [h] + q_4 [h^2] [h]^2  + q_5 [h]^4
\end{equation}
It is not necessary to consider 
terms with space-time derivatives acting on $h$, because they 
contribute to amplitudes with different momentum dependence
than the ones we are trying to cancel.
%We will now show that
%this theory must be strongly coupled at $\Lambda_3$. 

Now, we want to study the interactions coming from these terms. 
As usual, we do this by introducing Goldstone bosons, 
via
$h \leadsto A +A^T + A^T A$
and invoking the equivalence theorem. 
We work at high energy, where
any gauge dependent mass the Goldstone may have is irrelevant, and
taken to be zero. 
This implies that
$[A]=[\Phi]=0$ if these fields correspond to external lines
({\it i.e.} on-shell, massless particles).
In particular, quartic terms which involve $[h]$ and cubic
terms which involve $[h]^2$ do not contribute,
at first order, to diagrams with four external longitudinal modes. 
So, $q_3 , q_4 , q_5$ and $c_3$ contribute
only above $\Lambda_3$ and we can ignore them. 

Thus, the interactions which may contribute up to fourth order
in ${\cal L}_{\rm F P} + \Delta {\cal L}$ are:
\begin{multline}
{\cal L}_A =( 1 + 6 c_1 ) [A^2 A^T] + ( - 1 + 4 c_2 ) [A] [A A^T] + 2 c_1 [A^3
] + 4 c_2 [A^2] [A]\\
+ 2 q_1 [A^4] + ( 6 c_1 + 8 q_1 ) [A^3 A^T] + ( 3 c_1 + 4 q_1 ) [A A A^T A^T]
+ ( \frac{1}{4} + 3 c_1 + 2 q_1 ) [A A^T A A^T]\\
+ ( - \frac{1}{4} + 2 c_2 + 4 q_2 ) [A A^T] [A A^T] + ( 2 c_2 + 8 q_2 ) [A^2]
[A A^T] + 4 q_2 [A^2] [A^2] \label{cla}
\end{multline}
The first processes we consider involve scalar exchange.
Replacing $A \rightarrow\Phi$ once for each of
the cubic terms in \eqref{cla} shows that the relevant interactions are:
%\be
%( 1 + 8 c_1 ) [\Phi^3] + ( - 1 + 8 c_2 ) [\Phi] [\Phi^2] \rightarrow
%\frac{1}{3} ( 1 + 24 c_1 + 16 c_2 ) [\Phi^3]
%\ee
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal L}_A \supset \phi ( ( 1 + 6 c_1 + 8 c_2 )_{} A_{\nu , \alpha , \mu} A_{\mu ,
\alpha , \nu} + ( - 1 + 8 c_2 ) A_{\alpha , \nu , \mu} A_{\alpha , \mu , \nu}
) \label{scalcurr}
\end{eqnarray}
We have integrated by parts to remove the derivatives from $\phi$.
Amplitudes coming from these vertices are strong at either 
$\Lambda_5$, if the external $A_\mu$ are longitudinally
polarized ({\it i.e.} $A_\mu \to \phi_{,\mu}$),
or at $\Lambda_3$, if the external
$A_\mu$ are transverse. Either way, the amplitude will be
proportional to the scalar current in \eqref{scalcurr} squared and
so \eqref{scalcurr} must exactly vanish. So $c_2 = \frac{1}{8}$
and $c_1 = -\frac{1}{3}$.

Next, we will look at the $\Lambda_3$ diagrams from the process 
$A A\rightarrow \Phi \Phi $, 
which get a contribution from vector exchange:

The total amplitude, with the values for $c_1$ and $c_2$ we just
derived, is:

8 ( k_2 \varepsilon_1 ) ( k_3 \varepsilon_2 ) u^2]\\
+ ( 1 + 4 q_1 + 8 q_2 ) [8 ( k_1 \varepsilon_2 ) ( k_2 \varepsilon_1 ) ( t^2

t^2 + u^2 )] + ( 3 + 24 q_1 + 32 q_2 ) [4 ( k_1 \varepsilon_2 ) ( k_2
\varepsilon_1 ) t u]
\end{multline}
We have used
$k_4 = k_1 + k_2 - k_3$ and the
Mandelstam variables
$s\equiv k_1 k_2=k_3 k_4$, $t\equiv k_1 k_4=k_2 k_3$ 
and $u\equiv k_1 k_3=k_2 k_4$. 
The terms are grouped to illustrate that
no choice of $q_1$ and $q_2$ will make the entire
amplitude vanish. Therefore, there is no Lagrangian for
a single massive graviton which breaks down above $\Lambda_3$. 

\section{Cancellations in Truncated KK Theory \label{appfai}}
In this appendix we calculate the tree level scattering of the light
graviton modes in a Kaluza-Klein theory of 5D gravity. 
%We show that
%the strongest processes cancel through the sum of various contributions.
%An important result of this appendix is that it predicts the scale at
%which a truncated KK theory breaks down. 
Along the way, some subtle issues about setting up the calculation and
using the theory space formalism are addressed. In particular,
we now defend the choice of a circle, which initially
seems more complicated than the interval,
because of the extra graviphoton degree of freedom and the degenerate
spectrum. For a somewhat similar gauge
theory calculation the reader is referred to
\cite{Chivukula:2002ej,SekharChivukula:2001hz}.

For a general compactification, the KK wavefunctions $\chi^j ( z )$
depend on the the geometry and the boundary conditions. This lets the
Lagrangian be expressed, before the truncation, as the infinite sum
\begin{equation}
{\cal L} = \sum o^2_{i j} G_i G_j + o^3_{i j k} G_i G_j G_k +
\cdots \label{olapL}
\end{equation} 
The $o^n$ are constants determined by overlap integrals of the $\chi^j$.
For example, if we compactify on a circle of radius $R$, then
$\chi_n ( z ) = e^{2 \pi i \frac{n z}{R}}$ and 
$o_{ij}=\int \chi_i \chi_j dz =\delta(i+j)$.

We now need a prescription for
going from the KK basis to the theory space basis. That is, we need to choose
discrete wavefunctions $g_i = c_{i j} G_j$. 
Of course, the obvious choice is a discrete Fourier sum, but we have to be
very careful. The essential requirement for a nice theory space
representation
is that
interactions which take place at fixed $z$ in the 5D theory 
(that is, those which do not depend on $\partial_z$) should
 transform to interactions which take place on
a single site $j$. That way, the $R_{4 D}$ part of ${\cal L}$ \eqref{l5d4d}
will have a separate
general coordinate invariance for each site, and all the interactions of the
longitudinal modes will come from the $\partial_z$ part. This has
the advantage that all the interactions will be proportional to 
$M_{\rm Pl}^2 \partial_z^2 \simM_{\rm Pl}^2 m^2$ 
instead of $M_{\rm Pl}^2 \partial^2 \sim M_{\rm Pl}^2 E^2 \gg M_{\rm Pl}^2 m^2$. 
The only way this will happen is if we can choose the discrete
wavefunctions to have all the same overlap integrals as the continuous
wavefunctions:
\begin{equation}
o_{i \cdots k} = \frac{1}{R} \int_0^R d z \chi_i \cdots \chi_k =
\frac{1}{N} \sum_n c_{i n} \cdots c_{k n} \label{overlaps}
\end{equation} 
For a general KK theory this is not possible. 
But if we compactify on a circle,
$\chi_n ( z ) = e^{2 \pi i \frac{n z}{R}}$, 
then $c_{a b} = e^{2 \pi i\frac{a b}{N}}$ 
satisfies \eqref{overlaps}. Of course, {\it any} KK theory has a theory
space representation, but in general the theory space
will not simplify the structure of the interactions. For example, it
is not possible to satisfy \eqref{overlaps} on an interval, and so
there will be strong interactions simply from the sites' Lagrangians.
While amplitudes involving these interactions must cancel
other amplitudes at the end of the day,
we get this cancellation for free if we choose to the circle where
\eqref{overlaps} holds.

\subsection{Circle Lagrangian}
The truncated KK theory on a circle has a degeneracy at each mass level.
We will need
the quadratic, cubic, and quartic parts of the KK Lagrangian
which come from \eqref{lkkmid}:
\begin{multline}
{\cal L} \supset M_{\rm Pl}^2 {\cal L}_K ( G_n G_{- n} )
-M_{\rm Pl}^2 m_1^2\Big[ \delta ( n + m ) m n ( [G_n G_m] - [G_n] [G_m] )\\
+ m n \delta ( m + n + p ) \{\frac{1}{2} [G_p] [G_m G_n] \} - 2 [G_m G_p
G_n] + [G_n] [G_p G_m] + [G_m] [G_p G_n] \}"
