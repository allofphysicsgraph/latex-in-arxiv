We outline the construction of metastable de Sitter vacua of
type IIB string theory.  Our starting point is highly
warped IIB compactifications
with nontrivial NS and RR three-form fluxes.  By incorporating
known corrections to the superpotential from
Euclidean D-brane instantons or gaugino condensation, one
can make models with all moduli
fixed, yielding a supersymmetric AdS vacuum.  Inclusion of a small number of ${\overline{D3}}$ branes in the resulting warped geometry allows one to uplift the AdS minimum and make it a metastable de Sitter ground state.
The lifetime of our metastable de Sitter vacua is 
much greater than the cosmological timescale 
of $10^{10}$ years.  We also 
prove, under 
certain conditions,  that  the 
lifetime of dS 
space in string theory will always be shorter than the recurrence time.
