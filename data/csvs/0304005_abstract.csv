We complete the construction of the
Moyal star formulation of bosonic
open string field theory (MSFT) by providing
a detailed study  of the fermionic ghost sector.
In particular, as in the case of the matter sector,
(1) we construct a map
from Witten's star product to the Moyal product,
(2) we propose a regularization scheme
which is consistent with the matter sector
and (3) as a check of the formalism,
we derive the ghost Neumann coefficients algebraically
directly from the Moyal product. The latter
satisfy the Gross-Jevicki nonlinear relations
even in the presence of the regulator, and
when the regulator is removed they coincide numerically
with the expression derived from conformal field theory.
After this basic construction, we derive a regularized action
of string field theory in the Siegel gauge and
define the Feynman rules. We give explicitly the
analytic expression of the off-shell four point function
for tachyons, including the ghost contribution.
Some of the results in this paper have already  been used in
our previous publications.
This paper provides the
technical details of the computations which were omitted there.
