\item
From the relation involving;
$Q_{ja}, Q_{kb}$
and $z$ we get that the expression
$\{ Q_{ja}, \chi_{kb} \}$
is antisymmetric in the couples
$ja$ 
and 
$kb$ 
so if we define
\begin{equation}
F_{ab} \equiv {1\over 2} \epsilon_{jk} \{ Q_{ja}, \chi_{kb} \}, \qquad
C_{jk} \equiv {1\over 2} \epsilon^{ba} \{ Q_{ja}, \chi_{kb} \}

The relation involving

leads us to the introduction of a new field
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{ja} \equiv - {1\over 3} \epsilon_{kl} [Q_{ka}, C_{jl} ]
\end{equation}
and the action of the supercharge
$Q_{ka}$

\item
The relation involving
$Q_{ja}, Q_{kb}$
and 
$C_{lm}$
leads us to the introduction of a new field
\begin{equation}
d_{ab} \equiv \epsilon_{kl} \{ Q_{kb}, \lambda_{la} \};
\end{equation}
one finds out the this expression must be antisymmetric in $a$ and $b$ so in
fact the new field is the (complex) scalar field $D$ such that:
\begin{equation}
d_{ab} = {1\over 2} \epsilon_{ab} D;
\end{equation}
we now have the action of
