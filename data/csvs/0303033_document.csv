\section{Introduction}


Recent developments on supersymmetric gauge theories have shown
that there is a deep relationship between SUSY theories that admit a large $N$
limit and
zero dimensional matrix models \cite{DV,DV2,DV3}.
The
connection between these seemingly different physical systems arose from
the study of topological string theory amplitudes for open
strings, but now there are purely field-theoretic arguments that show
this connection.
Of the two available proofs \cite{DGLVZ,CDSW} of the correspondence
(for a $U(N)$ gauge theory),
 the most compelling one was given in the
paper \cite{CDSW}, as it gave a full dictionary between loop operators
on the matrix model and certain elements of the chiral ring of the
gauge theory, as well as
a proof that can be argued to be valid non-perturbatively.
Part of the setup  includes a correspondence between the
 gaugino condensate of the SUSY gauge theory and the
't Hooft coupling of the matrix model \cite{DV3}.

Having this connection makes it possible to solve for the vacuum
structure of the supersymmetric gauge field theory if one knows
how to solve the matrix model in the large $N$ limit.
We will refer the reader to \cite{DGZ,GM} for reviews of matrix 
models. A more recent list of solvable models appears in \cite{Ka}



The most successful and studied example to date has been given by
deforming the $U(N)$ ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory, whose solution was given by 
Seiberg and Witten \cite{SW} to an ${\cal N}=1$
gauge theory by adding a superpotential ${\rm tr}~ (V(X))$, where $X$ is
the chiral field superpartner of the vector multiplet and $V(X)$
is a polynomial in $X$, see for example \cite{CV, DV3, 
Chek, F, F2, Fuji, Gop, IM, CDSW, CSW}. This theory is
related to the one matrix model with potential $V(X)$. The
classical vacua of the gauge theory are described by distributing
eigenvalues on the roots of the polynomial $V'(X)$ giving rise to
a theory whose classically unbroken gauge group is $\prod U(N_i)$,
where
 there are $N_i$ eigenvalues in the $i$-th root of the polynomial
 $V'(X)$.

Similarly, in the matrix model, the vacua are also described by
distributing (an infinite number of) eigenvalues over the
classical saddle points of the matrix model. Each of these
classical points in the eigenvalue plane becomes a cut in the
eigenvalue plane due to quantum effects, when one considers the
spectral curve of the matrix model. For each cut there is an
associated 't Hooft coupling which counts how many eigenvalues end
up in the given cut. This information is related to a partial
gaugino condensate \cite{DV3}, whose holomorphic definition was
given nonperturbatively in \cite{CDSW}.

One of the advantages of this new method of computing gauge theory
results is that it does not assume S-duality like symmetries to
solve the theory, so it can provide tests of these highly
non-trivial symmetries. For example, aspects of the ${\cal N}=1^*$
vacuum structure have been studied in this way \cite{DHKS,DHKS2}, but a general
solution of the vacua of the theory in terms of matrix models is
not yet available.
 \footnote{This theory can also be solved by
first turning on a mass term deformation that gives rise to an
${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory, and finding the associated integrable
system \cite{DW,DHK,Hollow}. In principle, it is possible to evaluate all of
the holomorphic information by going to the appropriate point in
the moduli space of vacua.}

 Part of the failure to obtain the full solution of the matrix model
comes
from the fact that the classical ${\cal N}=1^*$ gauge theory vacua
is described by a decomposition into irreducible representations
of $SU(2)$, and there are an infinite number of such
representations. In the associated matrix model, this translates
into an infinite number of classical saddle points for the
eigenvalues of one of the matrices, let us call it $X$, and to
each such classical saddle point for the eigenvalue $x$ of $X$ one
can associate a cut in a spectral curve of the quantum theory (at
least, this is what experience dictates from the one-matrix
model). In particular, one has a potentially infinite number of
cuts. This suggests that one can not solve the loop equations of
the matrix model in a straightforward fashion, as there will be an
infinite number of unknown parameters: one can take these
parameters to be the number of eigenvalues in each cut $N_i$, but
more to the point, the one point functions $<X^n>$ depend
classically on all of the $N_i$. Thus, there are no recursion
relations which solve for the one point functions of the loop
operators $<X^n>$.

The technical issue is how to effectively truncate the problem to
finitely many cuts. In the one matrix model this is automatic, but
in the ${\cal N}=1^*$ theory one has to do this by hand. A related
problem in complex analysis can be phrased as follows: given a
Laurent series of an analytic function $f(z)=\sum a_i z^{-i}$ at
infinity, what are the constraints on the variables $a_i$ that
guarantee that $f(z)$ has a finite number of cuts in the interior
of the complex plane? The constraints involve an infinite number
of the coefficients of $f$ at the same time, since multiplying
$f(z)$ by any polynomial function of $z$ will always give a
function with the same properties. Looking at it from  this point
of view it also looks like the problem has no solution.


The current literature solves the abstract problem by making a clever
anzatz for the one-cut solution (or multi-cut solutions
 where all of the cuts are
correlated, see for example \cite{KKN, DHKS,DHKS2,DHK2,Man}),
that leads to studying functions on an elliptic curve, but it does
not solve in any sense a {\em general} multi-cut solution.

In this paper we will describe a new technique to solve (only
partially) similar matrix models based on getting information from
the gauge theory first. Since the gauge theory and the matrix
model data are in some sense equivalent, this statement might seem
paradoxical. We will concern ourselves with situations where the
superpotential is non-generic and there is the possibility of
having a moduli space of vacua. In particular, the allowed
deformations of the moduli space give a finite number of
parameters which determine part of the vacuum structure. In the
matrix model these turn out to be situations where the system of
loop equations is degenerate in some sense, a statement which will
be explained in detail later in  the paper, and there are more
free parameters than at a generic case. The main question we want
to address is: what does the moduli space tell us about the matrix
model?

To avoid undue suspense, we find that under some circumstances the
existence of a moduli space of  vacua produces an {\em integrable
sector} of the matrix model, this is, part of the problem behaves
like a one matrix model: one can find an infinite number of one
point functions with a finite amount of data. The finite amount of
data is exactly the one that characterizes the possible
deformations of the moduli space that are allowed by holomorphy.

To show the new technique, we will study two examples. First, a
toy example which reduces to the one matrix model, which we
understand very well. It will just be an illustration of the
matrix model techniques used.
 Then we will study a
three matrix model closely related to the ${\cal N}=1^*$ gauge
theory which has special properties that insure that certain
objects in the matrix model only have a finite number of cuts
automatically. This happy coincidence is tied to the fact that
these particularly gauge theories can be geometrically engineered.
We will in this paper always consider a gauge field theory which
can be geometrically engineered by placing branes on a singular
Calabi-Yau (CY) geometry. From this point of view we are exploring
 questions that relate the CY geometry to a matrix model.

The basic idea is that if we place fractional branes at the
singularities of the geometry, then the CY geometry will be
deformed by geometric transitions so that the singularities with
fractional branes on them are 'resolved'. This will be exactly like in the
Klebanov-Strassler geometry \cite{KS,GV}, repeated many times at many 
singularities, as in
\cite{CIV,CFIKV}.

If we insert a probe brane in the bulk (in the presence of the
fractional branes) then it's moduli space should correspond to the
deformed CY geometry. This idea is very common in the literature, see for 
example \cite{KS,GT,GT2,Bq}.
Fortunately, the shape of the CY can be
studied directly from the field theory \cite{BL,Brev}
 so it is possible to start
with a classical gauge field theory and produce certain CY
geometries, as opposed to start with the geometry and guess the field 
theory. If we place a brane in the bulk and compute it's
moduli space, the moduli space of the brane will be the CY
geometry. Of course, not every superpotential will lead to a CY
geometry, but for those that do one can make progress in
understanding the gauge theory questions by studying the geometry
(moduli space of the theory).
Also, one should be able to understand aspects of the matrix model by 
studying the geometry.

The main advantage with this setup is that the problem is controlled 
by holomorphy:
the possible deformations of the CY geometry that result from
placing fractional branes at singularities are not arbitrary, so
there are only a finite number of unknowns. This is exactly what
we are looking for, a situation where the potentially infinite
number of variables (cuts in the matrix model)
 is reduced to finitely many (we are assuming that
there is one cut per quantum deformation parameter, a statement which
will be justified later).

We want to study exactly what matrix model information we can get
from the gauge theory moduli space. We will use a proposal first
presented in \cite{Bq} to calculate the quantum moduli space from
the matrix model. The relation between the moduli space and how to
obtain it from the matrix model still lacks a proof, so it should
be treated as a conjecture that needs justification. However, one
can make predictions based on the calculation of the deformed
moduli space from the matrix model, and the one expected from
holomorphy. Some of these predictions can be verified directly by
manipulating the loop equations of the matrix model, and we will
use this calculation as a consistency check of the proposal.

In our examples, we will not solve the
matrix model completely (find all one point functions from a
finite amount of data). We will use the word `solve' in the
following more restricted sense: it is possible to determine an
infinite number of one point functions of the matrix model with a
finite amount of data. In essence, we obtain similar results to a one 
matrix model.


The main example we will study 
is a gauge theory that will have three matrices
$X,Y,Z$ in the adjoint of $U(N)$, and a superpotential of the
general form $$ {\rm tr}~ (XYZ-q XZY+ V(X)) $$ with the restriction
$q^n=1$, and a restriction on the form of $V(X)$ which depends on
$n$. Similar systems have been studied  
in \cite{D,DF,BJL,DHK2,Hollow, Man} and are interesting on their own right as
they encode structure of interesting 
deformations of ${\cal N}=4$ gauge theories \cite{LS}.
The  restrictions placed on the superpotential guarantee
 that there is a
CY geometry associated to the gauge theory \cite{D,DF,BJL}, and similar 
examples studied in \cite{CIV,CKV}.
 Also,  after a linear
change of variables on $X$, we can get for $q\neq 1$ an equivalent
superpotential of the form
$$
{\rm tr}~ (XYZ-q XZY+ \tilde V(X)+ m^2 YZ)
$$
The ${\cal N}=1^*$ gauge theory has the same matter content and
the potential
$$
{\rm tr}~ (XYZ- XZY+\tilde m^2 X^2 + m^2 YZ)
$$
so by varying $q$ we can in principle get arbitrarily close to
the ${\cal N}=1^*$ gauge theory. This particular
model has been studied extensively, also 
in relation to AdS/CFT \cite{PS,ADK}.
This is the main physical motivation to
write this paper: to approach the problem of solving the
${\cal N}=1^*$ vacuum structure from the matrix models,
 with an arbitrary number of 
cuts, as well as the related $q$ deformed systems. 
It is important to notice that setting $q\neq 1$ means that the conformal 
field theory with $V=0$ has only $N=1$ SUSY in four dimensions.
Therefore, techniques that depend on the quantum corrections 
being calculable 
in ${\cal N}=2$ theories, which then are softly broken 
to ${\cal N}=1$ can break down 
because there is less supersymmetry protecting the system. 
In particular, to use integrable systems like in ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theories,
but with less supersymmetry \cite{Hollow}, 
one actually needs a proof that the moduli space does not get lifted by 
quantum corrections.
These matrix models are also interesting on their own right, 
see for example \cite{Kos2}, so we can also gain insight into the problem 
of solving matrix models by using four dimensional SUSY gauge theory 
information.


\section{The one matrix model}\label{sec:1matrix}

In this short section we will show how the analysis of a quantum
moduli space can solve the one matrix model.  The whole purpose of
this section is to show that a quantum deformed CY geometry
contains information about loop equations of the matrix model.

Consider the  CY threefold  geometry
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CY1}
uv= (w- P(z))(w+P(z))
\end{equation}
where $P(z)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ ($P(z)=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i
z^i$), and which results from deforming the $A_1$ singularity
geometry $uv = w^2$. This procedure removes the codimension two
singularities and leaves only codimension three singularities
behind, which for generic $P(z)$ are conifold singularities.

The gauge theory associated to D-branes on this geometry has been 
studied in \cite{CIV,CKV,CFIKV,CV}, and it is given by a quiver
diagram with two nodes, representing the affine dynkin diagram 
$\hat A_1$.


 \epsfxsize=1in
 \epsfbox{quiver3.ep1}


Because there are two nodes in the quiver theory, one has general
gauge group $U(N)\times U(M)$. The superpotential of the theory is
given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:super1}
W = {\rm tr}~ ( Z A_1B_1 - B_1 A_1 \tilde Z - ZA_2B_2+B_2A_2 \tilde Z)
+{\rm tr}~ (V(Z) - V(\tilde Z)
\end{equation}
and in the case $V(x)=0$ the superpotential is the one that results
from an ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theory. $P(x)$ as a
polynomial is determined by the following equation $2P(x)=V'(x)$,
so one can relate the shape of the geometry and the gauge theory
parameters in the superpotential.

A brane in the bulk will have a theory characterized by the gauge
group $U(1)\times U(1)$. This is the correct fractional brane
content for a bulk brane in the orbifold geometry, and these
numbers do not change when we deform the geometry.

Also, if we take $M=0$, we see that we obtain a gauge theory with the same
matter content as the ${\cal N}=2$, $U(N)$ gauge theory, which has been
deformed by the potential $V(Z)$. Thus this particular theory is a
sub-theory of the one defined by the geometry.

This $U(N)$ does not have a moduli space of vacua, instead it has
a discrete set of vacua. These
 vacua at the classical level
are built by distributing the $N$
eigenvalues of $Z$ into the roots of $P(Z)$.
If there are $N_i$
eigenvalues at the $r_i$ root, the low energy effective (classical) theory
is given by pure gauge theory, with gauge group $\prod_i U(N_i)$.
Quantum effects lead to confinement of the $SU(N_i)$ groups, so in the
infrared of the quantum theory
we end up with a gauge group $\prod(U(1))$ over the roots
which have at least one eigenvalue.

To solve for the structure of the vacuum, we want to find the vevs
of all of the elements of the chiral ring.
 The chiral ring is generated by the following combinations
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac 1 {32\pi^2}tr(Z^nW_\alpha W^\alpha)\\
tr(Z^nW_\alpha)\\
tr(Z^n)
\end{eqnarray}
The ordering of $W$ inside the trace does not matter, because any
other ordering can be obtained by the addition of terms of the
form $\bar D M$, so at the level of the chiral ring they give the
same cohomology class. For our purposes, the elements of the
chiral ring which have a simple interpretation in a matrix model
are the ones given by $tr(Z^nW_\alpha W^\alpha)$. Using the
generalized Konishi anomaly for the variations $\delta Z \sim Z^kW_\alpha
W^\alpha$, Cachazo et al. \cite{CDSW} were able to show that these satisfy the
same equations as the loop equations for the one matrix model with
potential $V(X)$. This is
\begin{equation}
tr(V'(Z) Z^k W_\alpha W^\alpha) =\frac{1}{32\pi^2} \sum(tr(Z^{k-1-i}W_\alpha
W^\alpha)tr(Z^iW_\alpha W^\alpha)
\end{equation}
If we call $O_i = \frac1{32\pi^2}tr(Z^iW_\alpha W^\alpha)$, then the
equations
above read
\begin{equation}
tr(\sum a_j Z^{k+j} W_\alpha W^\alpha) =\frac{1}{32\pi^2}
\sum(tr(Z^{k-1-i}W_\alpha
W^\alpha)tr(Z^iW_\alpha W^\alpha)
\end{equation}
or equivalently
\begin{equation}
\sum a_j O_{k+j} = \sum_i O_{k-i-1} O_i
\end{equation}
This equation can be read as  a recursion relation for the vevs
$O_{n+k}$ for $k\geq 0$ in terms of the vevs $O_{0},\dots,
O_{n-1}$. All of these equations can be put in one single equation
in terms of a generating function for the $O_i$, defined as
follows
\begin{equation}
R(u) = \sum O_k u^{-k-1}
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:loop1matrix}}
V'(u)R(u) = R(u)^2 +f(u)
\end{equation}
where $f$ is an unknown polynomial of degree $n-1$. This is
necessary to seed the initial conditions for the recursion
relation. Given $f$ it straightforward to solve for $R(u)$. $f$ in
the quantum theory is determined by how we choose to distribute
the eigenvalues of $Z$ on the different roots of the classical
potential, and it encodes the different possible vacua of the
theory.


These equations above are the same equations that can be derived
from a one matrix model with potential $V(X)$.
 This is, we have the
matrix model
\begin{equation}
\int [dX] \exp (-N\mu^{-1} {\rm tr}~ (V(X)))
\end{equation}
which is to be solved in the planar limit in the large $N$ limit.
We can write the loop operators
\begin{equation}
<X^k> = \frac 1N{\rm tr}~ (X^k)
\end{equation}
and the loop equations for the one matrix model
\begin{equation}
<V'(X)X^k> = \mu \sum_i<X^{k-1-i}><X^i>
\end{equation}
So it is immediate to see
 that they have structurally the same form as the ones given
above (by setting $O_i\sim \mu<X^i>$).
 In the matrix model
we have the normalization condition $<X^0> =<1> =1$, which
identifies $\mu\sim \frac1{32\pi^2}<W_\alpha W^\alpha>=S$,
the gaugino condensate.
It is the identification between loop equations of a matrix model
and the chiral ring constraints that allow us to relate these two
very different mathematical problems.


Now, let us use the quantum moduli space technique to rederive the same loop
equations from a different point of view. The idea is to study the
gauge theory with potential \ref{eq:super1}, with one brane in the
bulk, this is, with gauge group $U(N+1)\times U(1)$.

The classical moduli space is obtained by solving the F-term
constraints. The constraints for the $A,B$ give us
\begin{equation}
zA_i - A_i\tilde z =0\quad B_i z-\tilde z B_i=0
\end{equation}
and since $\tilde z$ is a scalar, for $A,B$ to get a non-zero vev
and give us a brane in the bulk, we need that one of the
eigenvalues of $z$ is equal to $\tilde z$, and that $A,B$ be
eigenvectors of the matrix $z$ with eigenvalue $\tilde z$.

We can diagonalize $z$, and single out the ($1\times 1$) block
matrices corresponding to the eigenvalue $\tilde z$. With this
convention
\begin{equation}
z= \hbox{diag}(\tilde z, z_1 ,\dots z_n),\quad B= (b_i,0,\dots,0)\quad
A_i=\begin{pmatrix}a_i\\ 0\\\vdots\\0\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The other eigenvalues will be constrained by the equations
\begin{equation}
A_1B_1-A_2B_2 = V'(z)\quad B_1A_1-B_2A_2=V'(\tilde z)
\end{equation}
which result in $V'(z_i)=0$ and
\begin{equation}
b_1a_1-b_2a_2 = V'(\tilde z)
\end{equation}
From here, the classical eigenvalues $z_i$ which were not singled out
will be distributed
only along the saddle points of the potential $V$.

Now, to find the moduli space we need to write the constraints
between the gauge invariant variables (with respect to the group
$U(N+1)$) given by $\tilde z$ and the combinations
\begin{equation}
u=a_1b_2, v=a_2b_1, w = \frac{a_1b_1+a_2b_2}{2},
\Omega=\frac{a_1b_1-a_2b_2}{2}
\end{equation}
 Clearly, the F-terms imply $\Omega=V'(\tilde z)/2$.
 And we can also use the algebraic relation
\begin{equation}
w^2 = \Omega^2+uv = \frac{V'(\tilde z)^2}{4}+uv
\end{equation}
to obtain the equations describing the moduli space given by the
geometry \ref{eq:CY1}.

The classical moduli space is given by the single equation in four
variables $w, u, v, \tilde z$
\begin{equation}
w^2-uv -\frac{V'(\tilde z)^2}{4}=0
\end{equation}
and it has branes located at the singularities of the geometry.
Because there are singularities, it is possible to deform the moduli
space and remove the singularities. These deformations are
controlled by holomorphy.

We should expect that the quantum deformed moduli space is of the
form
\begin{equation}
w^2-uv -\frac{V'(\tilde z)^2}{4} = \hbox{Quantum deformations}=Q
\end{equation}
where the right hand side is a polynomial involving only positive
powers of the confining scale $\Lambda_{SU(N+1)}$, and which is
polynomial in the coefficients of $P$. This is the expected result from
holomorphy \cite{Snal,Sexact,Shol}.

The particular theory at hand
has an $SU(2)$ symmetry under which $A_1,A_2$ and
$B_1,B_2$ are doublets, while $z,\tilde z$ are singlets. $w,u,v$
together form a triplet, and $\Omega$ is a singlet. From these
symmetries one can see that the quantum deformations will be
independent of $w,u,v$, since terms of degree one in these
variables that could appear in the polynomial $Q$ above are not in
a singlet representation of $SU(2)$. Hence $Q$ can only be given
by a polynomial in $z$. The deformations should also be such that they
are subleading with respect to the deformations induced by
changing the couplings in the superpotential. If $V'(z)$ is of
degree $n$, and we change the functional form of $V'$ we can vary
the coefficients of $z^n, z^{n+1}, \dots, z^{2n}$ independently of
each other. The deformation should thus be of the form $f(z)$, with $f$
of degree smaller than $n$ \cite{CIV}.

It turns out that the number of parameters in the deformation $f$
is equal to the number of roots of $V'$. For each of these roots
there is a conifold singularity, and each of these singularities
can be deformed away by placing fractional branes at the given
conifold, thus inducing a geometric transition which is of the same type as 
the one in \cite{KS}. We get in the end
the same number of deformation parameters
as there are singularities in the
geometry.

Now we want to see that these deformations can be related to the
loop equations of the matrix model with potential $V$.

For this, we need to know how to derive the quantum moduli space of
the gauge field theory from the matrix model point of view. This has
been previously argued for in \cite{Bq}.

We need to consider a multi-matrix model with the same field content as
the gauge theory, and we take ${\tilde N}\to \infty$. However,
 we fix the matrix model so that the number of moduli stays fixed.
This is, we will consider a matrix model with one probe brane in the
bulk singled out.
We do this with a matrix
model potential
given by the classical superpotential of the theory.
$$
\int ([dz][d\tilde z][d A][d B])' \exp(W)
$$
where the prime indicates that we leave some matrix fields unintegrated
(exactly those that are massless perturbatively in the gauge theory).
Since in the matrix model we do a large $N$ expansion, we are going
to get to the results by analyzing the saddle point equations for
the variables $\tilde z$,
and what we called $a_i,b_i$ perturbatively above. Also, one of the
eigenvalues of $z$ in the gauge theory is singled out to be equal to
$\tilde z$ perturbatively. This eigenvalue will be called $z_0$ in the
matrix model. At least naively, we can ignore the effect of the matrix 
probe on the large $N$ matrix condensate because it would give rise 
to a $1/N$ effect. 



On going to a basis of eigenvalues for $z$, and including the
Vandermonde determinant  we find the following
integral to perform in the large $\tilde {N}$
limit:
\begin{eqnarray}
&\int \prod_{i\neq 0}[d\lambda_i][dA_{12}^i][(dB_{12})_i]
\Delta^2 \exp-\left\{\tilde N\mu^{-1}
\sum_{j=1}^{\tilde N}(\lambda_j-\tilde z)(A^j\cdot B_j) +\right.&
\\&\left.+ \tilde N\mu^{-1} \sum_{j=0}^{\tilde N} V(\lambda_j)
-{\tilde N}\mu^{-1}V( \tilde z)+{\tilde N}\mu^{-1}(z_0-\tilde z)((a_1 )(b_1) -
(a_2)(b_2)) \right\}&
\end{eqnarray}
The above equation includes the Vandermode for all of the eigenvalues of $z$,
 not 
just the Vandermonde of the large $N$ condensate.
In the equations above $\Delta^2$ is the Vadermonde determinant.
The sum over $j$ of $A^jB_j$ is over the color indices associated
to the eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\dots\lambda_{\tilde N}$, but not to $z_0$.
This has
been separated in the last line because we want
$a_1,b_1, a_2,b_2$ to be moduli in the matrix model,
 so they cannot be massive at the saddle point.
From this condition one of the eigenvalues of $z$ is equal to
$\tilde z$.

In the equation above it is possible to integrate $A^j,B_j$ completely.
This being a Gaussian
integral over four coordinates of mass $\lambda_j-\tilde z$
gives us a measure term equal to
$\delta= \prod_{i\neq 0}(\lambda_i-\tilde z)^{-2}$

The logarithm of the Vandermonde determinant combined with $\delta$ is then
$$\log(\Delta^2 \delta) =
\sum_{i\neq j} 2\log(\lambda_i-\lambda_j)
-2 \sum_{i\neq 0} \log(\lambda_i-\tilde z)$$
and it is the term in the effective action for the
eigenvalues $\lambda$ and $z$.
Now we want to solve for the saddle point of this setup
in the large $\tilde N$ limit. This will result in summing all of the planar
diagrams of massive fields in the above theory.
Notice that the eigenvalues $\tilde z$ and $z_0$ do not have an
 interaction between
them, because we have not integrated out the massless modes of $A,B$.
The saddle point equation for the zero components of $A$, $B$
generic make $\tilde z=z_0$ in this situation.

One sees that
the saddle point equations for the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ are
the same as when we have the theory $U(\tilde N)\times U(0)$,
 because the contribution from $z_0$ cancels the
contribution from $z$ when they are equal. This seems accidental in 
the matrix model.
The saddle point equation for the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ is
\begin{equation}
 \tilde N \mu^{-1} V'(\lambda_i) -
2\sum_{j\neq i} \frac 1{\lambda_i-\lambda_j} = 0
\end{equation}
Now let $w(\lambda) = \frac 1{\tilde N}\sum_{i\neq 0} \frac{1}
{\lambda-\lambda_i}$
be the resolvent of the matrix model.

The saddle point equations for $\tilde z = z_0$ are identically
equal to
\begin{equation}
 V'(\tilde z) - 2\mu w(\tilde z) +a_1b_1-a_2b_2 = 0
\end{equation}
From here, we can use the same identity that led us to the classical moduli
space to find that the quantum moduli space, as described by the matrix model,
should be given by the equation
\begin{equation}
w^2 - uv = \frac 14(V'(\tilde z) - 2\mu w(\tilde z))^2
\end{equation}
Now, we compare the matrix model prediction to the  prediction obtained  by
holomorphy arguments.
It should be the case that two different functions of $\tilde z$ are
 identical, these are as follows
\begin{equation}
\frac 14(V'(\tilde z) - 2\mu w(\tilde z))^2 =\frac 14(V'(\tilde z))^2+ f(z)
\end{equation}
where $f$ is a polynomial. We obtain from these the following
set of equations
(after changing the normalization of  $f$ to $\tilde f=-4 \mu^{-1} f$)
\begin{equation}
V'(\tilde z) w(\tilde z) -  \mu w(\tilde z)^2 = \tilde f(\tilde z)
\end{equation}
which encode the full set of loop equations of the one matrix
model \ref{eq:loop1matrix}, when we realize that $R(u)$ and $w(\tilde z)$
are really the same object.

To summarize: the quantum deformed moduli space of a supersymmetric
gauge theory  can encode loop equations for a matrix model. The above result
for a one matrix model is not new and seems redundant,
but the results in the following
sections, using the same techniques are new.


\section{Superpotential
deformations of ${\cal N} = 4$ SUSY gauge theories}

The ${\cal N}=4$ SUSY gauge theory is a supersymmetric field theory
characterized by a gauge group $G$ \footnote{The gauge group
 will be $U(N)$ for the remainder
of the paper. The results presented here can be generalized to
other gauge groups which admit a large $N$ description} and three fields
$X,Y,Z$ in the adjoint whose superpotential (up to normalization)
is given by
\begin{equation}
{\rm tr}~ ( XYZ - XZY)
\end{equation}
This theory is a superconformal field theory
which spontaneously breaks the conformal invariance at generic points
in the moduli space,
 but if the vacuum is at the
origin in moduli space (the gauge group is unbroken) then the theory
has a vacuum with superconformal invariance.

The gauge theory with ${\cal N}=4$ SUSY has a moduli space of
conformal field theories parametrized by the gauge coupling of the theory
$g$. If we consider deformations of the superpotential, this moduli space of
${\cal N}=1$ superconformal field theories possesses a three parameter family
of deformations which give rise to superconformal field theories
\cite{LS}. These have
(up to normalization) the following form of the superpotential
\begin{equation}
W_0 = {\rm tr}~ ( XYZ - q XZY + \frac \beta3(X^3+Y^2+Z^3))
\end{equation}
and they also respect a ${"
