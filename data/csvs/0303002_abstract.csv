By considering the vacuum polarization, we study the effects of
geometry on electrostatic self--energy of a test charge near the
black hole horizon and also in regions with strong and weak
curvature in static two dimensional curved backgrounds. We discuss
the relation of ultraviolet behavior of the gauge field propagator
and charge confinement.
