% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
\noindent
We discuss the instability of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective action (or
its supersymmetric ground-state)\ with respect to  higher order
derivative terms. As such terms must be present in an effective action, the
V-Y action alone cannot describe the dynamics of SYM consistently. We
introduce an extension of this action, where all instabilities are removed by
means of a much richer structure of the K\""ahler potential. We demonstrate that the dominant contributions to the
effective potential are determined by the non-holomorphic part of the action
and we prove that the non-perturbative ground-state can be equipped with
stable dynamics. Making an expansion near the
resulting ground-state to second order in the derivatives  never leads back to the result by Veneziano and
Yankielowicz. As a consequence new dynamical effects arise, which are interpreted as the formation of
massive states in the boson sector (glueballs) and are accompanied by dynamical supersymmetry breaking. As this
regime of the dynamics is not captured by standard semi-classical analysis
(instantons etc.), our results do not contradict these calculations but
investigate the physics of the system beyond these approximations.

\section{The Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian}
\label{sec:vylag}
%
The effective description of $N=1$ SYM theories goes back to the work by
Veneziano and Yankielowicz \cite{veneziano82}. The authors showed that it is
possible to obtain a low energy description of the theory by means of an
effective Lagrangian in terms of the anomaly multiplet (also referred to as
Lagrangian or glue-ball multiplet)
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Phidef}
\Phi = \inv{8 \cg} \tr W^\alpha W_\alpha = \varphi + \theta \psi + \theta^2 F
\end{equation}
%
In the present paper we extend this Lagrangian by adding higher
derivative terms and we show that this procedure changes the role of the local
part of \cite{veneziano82} in a non-trivial way. To make our statements more
transparent we shortly review the arguments leading to the Lagrangian of
ref.\ \cite{veneziano82}.

It is most natural to assume that the low-energy dynamics of confined SYM
theories must be described in terms of the anomaly multiplet $\Phi$. Indeed,
its lowest component is the gaugino-condensate, the spinor represents the
Goldstino if supersymmetry breaks dynamically and its highest component
contains the operators $\tr F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}$ and $\tr F_{\mu \nu}
\fdual^{\mu \nu}$ used to represent the anomaly of the $R$-current and
scale invariance. Also, this multiplet has a definite interpretation in the
underlying symmetry structure as it appears in the anomaly of the
supercurrent\footnote{This supercurrent in equation \eqref{eq:anomcurrent} is
  not to be confused with the local current of the supercharge $Q_\alpha$.}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:anomcurrent}
  \bar{D}^{\dot{\alpha}} V_{\alpha \dot{\alpha}} = \frac{2}{3 \cg}
  \frac{\beta(g)}{g^3} \Phi \ .
\end{equation}
%
Thus we can expect that the multiplet $\Phi$ is defined not only in perturbation
theory but
also in the non-perturbative region. The effective description is obtained by
writing down the most general Lagrangian in terms of $\Phi$ having the correct
symmetry properties. $\Phi$ is gauge-invariant by construction and
supersymmetry is realized linearly as $\Phi$ is a chiral superfield. Thus the
most general Lagrangian has the form
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:localkahler}
    \mathcal{L} = \intd{\diff{^4x}} \biggl( \intd{\diff{^4 \theta}} K(\Phi,
  \bar{\Phi}) - \bigl(\intd{\diff{^2 \theta}} W(\Phi) + \hc \bigr) \biggr)\ .
\end{equation}
%
The remaining symmetries are the anomalous $R$-current, scale invariance and
special supersymmetry transformations ($S$-supersymmetry). Correct
anomaly cancellation is obtained by a term $\propto \Phi \log(z \Phi/\Lambda^3)$
with $\Lambda$ being the scale of the theory
\cite{veneziano82,burgess95}. Adding up all invariant terms that are
polynomial in the field $\Phi$, we
arrive at the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vylagrangian}
  \Ltext{V-Y} = \intd{\diff{^4x}}  \biggl( \intd{\diff{^4 \theta}} 9 a (\bar{\Phi} \Phi)^{\inv{3}} -
  \Bigl(\intd{\diff{^2 \theta}} \bigl(\frac{2 \beta(g)}{9 \cg g^3} \Phi \log
  \frac{z \Phi}{\Lambda^3} + b \Phi \bigr)  + \hc \Bigr) \biggr) \ .
\end{equation}
%
Symmetries determine the Lagrangian up to four dimensionless constants $a$,
$b$, $z$ and the renormalized coupling constant of the fundamental theory,
$g$. Performing the integrals over Grassman variables yields ($2 \beta /(9 \cg g^3)
= c$) 
%
\begin{multline}
\label{eq:vykahler}
  \intd{\diff{^4 \theta}} 9 (\bar{\Phi} \Phi)^{\inv{3}} =\medsp
  = (\bar{\varphi} \varphi)^{-\frac{2}{3}} \bigl(\partial_\mu \bar{\varphi}
  \partial^\mu \varphi + \half{i} \psi \sigma^\mu \lrpartial_\mu \bar{\psi} +
  \bar{F} F \bigr) - \frac{i}{9} \psi \sigma^\mu \bar{\psi} (\bar{\varphi}
  \varphi)^{-\frac{5}{3}} (\varphi \lrpartial_\mu \bar{\varphi}) \medsp
  + \inv{9} (\bar{\varphi} \varphi)^{-\frac{5}{3}} (\psi \psi) (\bar{\psi} \bar{\psi}) +
  \inv{3}  (\varphi^{-\frac{2}{3}} \bar{\varphi}^{-\frac{5}{3}} F \bar{\psi}
  \bar{\psi} + \hc )
\end{multline}
and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vysuperpot}
  \intd{\diff{^2 \theta}} \bigl(c \Phi \log
  \frac{z \Phi}{\Lambda^3} + b \Phi \bigr) = c \bigl( F
  - \inv{2 \varphi} \psi \psi + F \log \frac{z \varphi}{\Lambda^3} \bigr) + b F\ .
\end{equation}
%
At this point Veneziano and Yankielowicz treat $F$ as an auxiliary field and
eliminate it by means of its
equation of motion (in accordance with \eqref{eq:introd3}). Indeed, varying \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} with respect to
$\bar{F}$ (we drop the unimportant linear terms by choosing $b = -c$)
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vyelimination}
  F = - \inv{3} \frac{\psi \psi}{\varphi} + \frac{(\bar{\varphi}
  \varphi)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{a} c \log \frac{\bar{z} \bar{\varphi}}{\Lambda^3}
\end{equation}
%
and inserting this back into the Lagrangian an expression completely
independent of $F$ --and thus independent of $\tr F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu \nu}$ and
$\tr F_{\mu\nu} \fdual^{\mu \nu}$-- is obtained:
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vyonshell}
  \begin{split}
    \Ltext{V-Y} &= \intd{\diff{^4x}} a (\bar{\varphi} \varphi)^{-\frac{2}{3}} \bigl(\partial_\mu \bar{\varphi}
  \partial^\mu \varphi + \half{i} \psi \sigma^\mu \lrpartial_\mu \bar{\psi}
  \bigr) - \frac{i a}{9} \psi \sigma^\mu \bar{\psi} (\bar{\varphi}
  \varphi)^{-\frac{5}{3}} (\varphi \lrpartial_\mu \bar{\varphi}) \medsp
  &\quad - \frac{(\bar{\varphi} \varphi)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{a} c^2 \log \frac{z
  \varphi}{\Lambda^3} \log\frac{\bar{z}
  \bar{\varphi}}{\Lambda^3} + c \Bigl((\psi \psi) (\inv{3 \varphi} \log \frac{\bar{z}
  \bar{\varphi}}{\Lambda^3} + \inv{2 \varphi}) + \hc \Bigr)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
After having eliminated the auxiliary field the chirally broken minimum with
$\varphi_0 = \Lambda^3/z$ is found. Notice again that this minimum is not
obtained from the superpotential \eqref{eq:vysuperpot} alone. The
non-holomorphic terms in $F$ from \eqref{eq:vykahler} play a crucial role to
arrive at this conclusion.

The complex number $z$ determines the
phase of $\varphi_0$. In this work we consider the action as a quantum
effective action obtained from a source-extension (discussed in section
\ref{sec:construction} below). Vacuum alignment then dynamically determines
the phase of $\varphi_0$: $\varphi_0 < 0$ and thus  $z$ must be negative. This follows from
PCAC analysis \cite{gell-mann68} or QCD effective actions \cite{gasser82}, in
more general situations a complete study of thermodynamical limits
\cite{minkowski90,bergamin01,bergamin01:2} may be important. Thus we set $z$
in the following to $z = -1$. Making an expansion around this minimum
and absorbing the constant in front of the kinetic term by a field
redefinition
%
\begin{align}
  \varphi' &= \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\Lambda^2} \varphi\ , & \psi' &=
  \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\Lambda^2} \psi\ ,
\end{align}
%
one finds the supersymmetric spectrum with $m = (c/a) \Lambda$ as masses for
both, $\varphi$ and $\psi$.

\section{From Local to Non-Local Actions}
\label{sec:vytononlocal}
%
It is of utmost importance to observe that all conclusions from the
work by Veneziano and Yankielowicz --unbroken supersymmetry, confining vacuum
state with spectrum, positivity property of the potential-- can be drawn \emph{if and only if} the field $F$ is
auxiliary. We prove in this section that this statement must be an exact
mathematical requirement on the full theory (including all terms beyond the
approximation \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} or \eqref{eq:vyonshell}). Thus in any
enveloping theory, of which \eqref{eq:vyonshell} shall be an approximation,
$F$ remains an auxiliary field \emph{exactly}.

We will prove below that this restriction is untenable, as the
Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian must be extended by additional terms
promoting $F$ to an independent physical degree of freedom. Indeed, we cannot
expect that this action represents the complete dynamics at low energies: it
has derivative terms up to $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ only, which is not acceptable
for an interacting theory. Generalizing \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} we write
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vygeneralization}
  \Ltext{SYM} (\Phi, \bar{\Phi}, \ldots) = \Ltext{V-Y}(\Phi, \bar{\Phi}) +
  \Delta \mathcal{L}(\Phi, \bar{\Phi}, \ldots)\ ,
\end{equation}
%
where the dots indicate that the full effective action could depend on additional
fields. The subsequent arguments of this section do not depend on the
approximation techniques as exemplified by the Wilsonian action, which is also
of the form \eqref{eq:vygeneralization}.

Whether $\Ltext{V-Y}$
is a good approximation of the whole theory or not depends on the details of
$\Delta \mathcal{L}$. Usually it is assumed that such an expansion up to second
order in the derivatives leads to a good approximation if all neglected terms
are suppressed by inverse powers of $\Lambda$. But stability/instability is not just a question
of the order of contributions from $\Delta \mathcal{L}$: If $\Ltext{V-Y}$
shall be an approximation of the whole theory, we thus have to
ensure that the fundamental behavior of the $F$ field (namely being auxiliary)
is not changed by $\Delta \mathcal{L}$.

The field $F$ has
mass dimension four and suppressing the dependence on the additional fields
present (or setting them to their ground-state values $\varphi = \varphi_0$
and $\psi \equiv 0$) the Lagrangian by  Veneziano and Yankielowicz remains of
the form \eqref{eq:introd3}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vyFlag}
  \Lindex{F} = \frac{c_1}{\Lambda^4} \bar{F} F - d F - \bar{d} \bar{F}\ .
\end{equation}
%
Considering the stability of the system the linear terms are irrelevant. The potential in $F$ is not bounded
from below but instead has an absolute maximum, the typical behavior of an
auxiliary field. The supersymmetric spectrum obtained by Veneziano and
Yankielowicz is found by sitting on the top of the auxiliary-field potential,
which only after elimination of $F$ becomes the new minimum of the physical
potential.

We now add additional contributions from $\Delta \mathcal{L}$ to the
action. They should start at order $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^{-6})$ and can include
derivative terms as well as modifications of the potential. Allowing additional derivative terms from $\Delta \mathcal{L}$, e.g.\
a new term
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vyFlag2}
  \Lindex{F} = \frac{|c_2|}{\Lambda^6} \partial_\mu F \partial^\mu \bar{F} + \frac{c_1}{\Lambda^4} \bar{F} F - d F - \bar{d} \bar{F}
\end{equation}
%
could appear, disqualifying the interpretation of $F$ as auxiliary field. Of course the kinetic
term in $F$ is formally suppressed compared to the kinetic
terms of $\varphi$ and $\psi$, which are of order
$\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^{-4})$. But at this point it is important to notice that
the stability of a system and the characterization of certain fields as auxiliary ones cannot be
restricted to some approximation but are \emph{exact mathematical
  statements}. If $c_2$ --or any higher order derivative in $F$-- is non-zero,
$F$ \emph{is no longer an auxiliary field}. Of course, this behavior has
nothing to do with supersymmetry, but is a simple statement about classical
mechanics: We put a ball on the top of a hill. When hitting it with an
arbitrarily small but finite momentum (i.e. some dynamics that can be suppressed by any
finite power of the typical scale (mass of the ball) of the system) this
inevitably leads to a dynamical revelation, i.e.\ the ball will roll down the
hill. A different conclusion is allowed if and only if the ball is an
``auxiliary ball''. This means that the dynamics have to vanish exactly \emph{in
the full theory} and we can't hit the ball at all, not even with an
infinitesimal momentum.

If $c_2$ (or any other term from $\Delta \mathcal{L}$ including derivatives on
$F$) is non-zero, the only way out is to provide for a finite bottom of the hill in \eqref{eq:vyFlag2} (cf.\ figure \ref{fig:potential}). If we assume that the action \eqref{eq:vyFlag2} is complete up to
order $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^{-4})$ the simplest solution is
%
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[{scale=0.5}]{oldpot} \hspace{3cm}
    \includegraphics[{scale=0.5}]{newpot}
\end{center}
    \caption{Additional terms to the potential of $F$ can turn the unstable
      potential from the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian (left hand side) into
      an acceptable potential for dynamical $F$ (right hand side). If $F$ is
      auxiliary, the ground state is represented by the maximum of the
      Veneziano-Yankielowicz potential, if $F$ is dynamical the latter is
      represented by the minimum of the new potential.}
    \label{fig:potential}
\end{figure}
%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vyFlag3}
  \Lindex{F} = \frac{|c_2|}{\Lambda^6} \partial_\mu F \partial^\mu \bar{F} +
  \frac{c_1}{\Lambda^4} \bar{F} F  - \frac{|c_3|}{\Lambda^{12}} (\bar{F} F)^2 - d F - \bar{d} \bar{F}\ .
\end{equation}
%
Now our ball will still roll down the hill, but at least this will stop when
it reaches the new minimum ($d = 0$ in the following)
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phi4min}
  F_0 = \Lambda^4 \sqrt{\frac{|c_1|}{2 |c_3|}}\ ,
\end{equation}
which is simply the minimum of a Mexican-hat potential. In this new minimum we
may still arrive at the conclusion that the dynamics of $F$ are suppressed and
that we may integrate this field out in a low-energy
approximation (notice that an application of this idea to supersymmetry won't
lead to a Goldstone mode from $F$). But this is now an approximation allowed
in the vicinity of the ground-state \eqref{eq:phi4min}, only. The correct ground-state is given by
\eqref{eq:phi4min} and the original interpretation of $F$ being an auxiliary
field (cf.\ \eqref{eq:vyFlag}) is \emph{never} an approximation to the true
behavior of the theory.

Equation \eqref{eq:vyFlag3} describes an effective Mexican-hat of some field
with mass dimension four. Abstracting from supersymmetry we once again
can make absolutely transparent what happens: The full dynamics of the system tell
us that the minimum of the potential is (up to a phase) at $F_0$ of equation
\eqref{eq:phi4min}. Sitting in this minimum we obtain the correct physical
spectrum of the theory and may integrate out some fields  if they are really
suppressed. Standing on the top of the hill however, power counting and
suppression arguments are absolutely fallacious. Else we would arrive at the
conclusion that both $c_2$ and $c_3$ are irrelevant effects and the theory
shrinks to the action \eqref{eq:vyFlag2}. Obviously this does not at all
describe the correct physics of a Mexican-hat like potential as the system is expanded around an unstable
point.

The question whether \eqref{eq:vyonshell} is a suitable approximation of the
low-energy dynamics of SYM or not thus depends on the details of the full
theory. Of main importance is the question whether $\Delta \mathcal{L}$ really
contains derivative terms on the field $F$ or not.
Such terms must be present due to the following two points:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{enum:p1}Supersymmetry is realized linearly. This is one of the basic assumptions
  made when writing down the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:vylagrangian}. But again,
  this is a statement about the whole effective action. Thus not solely
  \eqref{eq:vylagrangian}, but also $\Delta \mathcal{L}$ must be an integral
  over superspace.

  If the low energy dynamics are
  described by $\Phi$ alone (e.g.\ in a quantum effective action), higher
  derivatives on $\varphi$ and $\psi$ inevitably lead to derivative terms in $F$. When introducing
  additional fields, we could try to arrange them in such a way that all
  derivative terms in the auxiliary fields cancel (such a model has been
  derived in ref.\ \cite{gates97} as an ansatz for the effective action of
  SUSY QCD). Using this idea in pure SYM would imply that the new fields
  are not suppressed compared to $\Phi$, in contradiction to our assumption
  about the low-energy dynamics of SYM. Thus it is impossible to keep $F$
  auxiliary in a non-local Lagrangian, if the low-energy dynamics shall depend
  on the three fields $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $F$, only. 
\item \label{enum:p2}The effective action must have higher order derivative terms that are
  not present in the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian. A local effective
  action is not acceptable for an interacting theory.

  Besides this general objection a careful analysis within the supersymmetric
  framework shows that the locality of supersymmetric non-linear sigma models
  is not just a harmless peculiarity when using them in effective
  descriptions. Indeed, the low energy spectrum should include the glue-ball. The only candidate for a
  glue-ball operator is $F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}$, the real part of $F$. If
  $F$ remains auxiliary we have to assume that the glue-ball of $N=1$ SYM does not
  belong to the relevant low-energy degrees of freedom. Even if this
  assumption is correct the relation to pure YM theory remains
  mysterious. If the low-energy dynamics shall be described in terms of
  renormalizable operators (or their classical fields, resp.)\ pure YM theory
  does generate non-trivial dynamics for $F_{\mu \nu}
  F^{\mu \nu}$ and we are left with the unsatisfactory situation that either
  the two classical fields $\bra{\Omega(J)} F_{\mu \nu}
  F^{\mu \nu} \ket{\Omega(J)}_{\mbox{\tiny{SYM}}}$ and $\bra{\Omega(J)} F_{\mu \nu}
  F^{\mu \nu} \ket{\Omega(J)}_{\mbox{\tiny{YM}}}$ are completely independent objects
  or that
    there exists a phase transition in the decoupling of the gluino by giving
    it a heavy mass (its origin and consequences have been discussed in
    \cite{bergamin01}). It has been tried to escape this restriction by the
    choice of a more complicated geometry than realized in
    \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} \cite{farrar98}. From our point of view the result
    of \cite{farrar98} cannot lead to a resolution of the problem
    \cite{bergamin01}. Moreover, trying to add higher order derivatives to the
  action of \cite{farrar98} leads to the same complications as discussed in
  this work for the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian and their resolution  automatically leads to the inclusion of the glue-ball dynamics (see
  next section). Thus the construction of \cite{farrar98} becomes redundant in
  the context of non-local actions.
\end{enumerate}
%
As a consequence of (1) and (2) $F$ has to be seen as an independent degree of freedom. At least in the
framework of effective actions it is possible to formulate consistent
supersymmetric actions of this type \cite{bergamin02:1}, where some important features
of supersymmetric theories with ``normal'' auxiliary fields are compromised. This especially
includes (see ref.\ \cite{bergamin02:1} for a detailed discussion):

\begin{enumerate}
\item The full potential is not positive semi-definite: Obviously the
  positivity of the potential holds after elimination of the auxiliary fields,
  only. The statement that supersymmetric potentials are always positive
  semi-definite is actually a statement about the maximum of the auxiliary
  field potential: The latter is zero (unbroken supersymmetry) or positive
  (broken supersymmetry). As this maximum does no longer represent the ground
  state in a theory with dynamical ``auxiliary'' fields, the physical potential
  can have a negative minimum. This has important consequences in the
  discussion of supersymmetry breaking: In classical and perturbative
  supersymmetry a supersymmetric state (i.e. a state with vanishing potential) is automatically the ground-state and
  implies unbroken supersymmetry. In the non-perturbative region this
  conclusion does not hold, as the ``auxiliary'' fields become dynamical.
\item While the potential is not necessarily positive, the restriction on the
  vacuum energy still holds: $\lomega T_{\mu \nu} \romega = g_{\mu \nu} E_0
  \geq 0$ due to supersymmetry current-algebra relations \cite{salam74}. $E_0
  > 0$ implies supersymmetry breaking, while $E_0 = 0$ means
  unbroken supersymmetry. In a strictly perturbative and/or semiclassical
  logic a strict relation between the minimum of the effective potential and
  the order parameter $E_0$ exists: $(\veff)_0 \equiv E_0$ due to the
  non-renormalization theorem. In a fully non-perturbative framework an
  extension of this relation to $(\veff)_0 \neq 0$, $E_0 \neq 0$ but
  $(\veff)_0 \neq E_0$ is possible. A consistent relation of this form can
  be achieved only by a non-perturbative extension of the trace anomaly
  \eqref{eq:anomcurrent}\footnote{In this paper we do not provide such an extension.}.
  But in any case the order parameter of
  supersymmetry breaking is still $E_0$ and in the effective theory the
  latter is represented by the value of
  $F$ in the ground-state.
\item Supersymmetry breaks dynamically. Interestingly enough this follows directly
  from \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} and \eqref{eq:vyonshell}: The unstable maximum
  is at the supersymmetry preserving point (vanishing potential and $F = 0$). As the
  action \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} is complete up to order
  $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^{-4})$, the unstable maximum cannot turn directly into
  a minimum (stability of $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ forbids to choose $a<0$ in \eqref{eq:vylagrangian}). Instead, the new minimum must be at a different value of $F$:
  $F_0 \neq 0$. But $F$ is the order parameter of supersymmetry breaking and
  we arrive at the desired result. The argument of \cite{veneziano82} that
  supersymmetry is unbroken in $N=1$ SYM thus turns into the opposite when
  taking into account all (including non-local) terms.
