\vspace{5mm}

We introduce the brane-bulk interaction to discuss a limitation of
the cosmological Cardy-Verlinde formula  which is useful for  the
holographic description of brane cosmology. In the presence of the
brane-bulk interaction, we cannot find  the  entropy
representation of the first Friedmann equation (the cosmological
Cardy-Verlinde formula). In the absence of the interaction,  the
cosmological Cardy-Verlinde formula  is established even for  the
time-dependent charged AdS background. Hence, if there exists a
dynamic exchange of energy between the brane and the bulk (that
is, if $\tilde T^t~_y \not=0$), we cannot achieve  the
cosmological holographic principle on the brane.
