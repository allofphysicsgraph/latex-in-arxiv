We discuss isotropic and homogeneous D-brane-world cosmology with
non-Abelian Born-Infeld (NBI) matter on the brane. In the usual
Fried\-mann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model the scale non-invariant
NBI matter gives rise to an equation of state which asymptotes to
the string gas equation $p=-\ve/3$ and ensures a start-up of the
cosmological expansion with zero acceleration. We show that the
same state equation in the brane-world setup leads to the Tolman
type evolution as if the conformal symmetry was effectively
restored. This is not precisely so in the NBI model with
symmetrized trace, but the leading term in the expansion law is
still the same. A cosmological sphaleron solution on the D-brane
is presented.
