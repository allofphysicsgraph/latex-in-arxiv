    G^{(2)}_3=\dfrac{1}{4g}-1-10g+o(g),
    \\
    G^{(3)}_2=\dfrac{1}{4g}+\dfrac 1 2+8g+o(g),
    \end{array}
\end{equation*}
and in the two-cut case the planar two-point function (\ref{planar3}) is
\[
    G_2^{(4)}=\frac{1}{4g}.
\]


2. The asymptotical expressions for the parquet two-point
functions in the false vacuum (\ref{parquetfalse12}),
(\ref{parquetfalse3}) are
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{l}
    D^{(1)}_2=-1-12g+o(g),
    \\
    D^{(2)}_2=-1-8g+o(g),
    \\
    D^{(3)}_2=-\dfrac{1}{4g}+o(g),
    \end{array}
\end{equation*}
and in the true vacuum the two-point function has the following asymptotic (\ref{True})
\[
    D^{(4)}_2=\dfrac{1}{4g}+\dfrac 1 2+\dfrac 5 4 g+o(g).
\]

Hence, $D^{(4)}_2$, two-point Green function computed within the
planar parquet approach in the true vacuum, coincides with
$G^{(3)}_2$, two-point Green function computed within the planar
approximation also in the true vacuum.

As it was mentioned the parquet planar approach gives a very good
agreement with the exact results in the one-cut case for the case
of the positive mass square. In the case of the matrix Higgs
model the situation seems more delicate because of the its
multi-phase structure. Nevertheless, the planar parquet
approximation leads to a rather good agreement at least in the
small coupling limit.

We have shown that in the planar parquet approximation it is
possible to construct the generating functional for the Green
functions. Besides, we have shown that the generating functional
in the planar limit depends on the approximation chosen and,
therefore, can be restricted to a subset of diagrams just by
modifying initial conditions of the system.
