The one-loop radiative correction to the Chern-Simons coefficient is
computed in noncommutative Chern-Simons-Higgs model at zero and at
finite temperature. At high temperature, we show that the static limit
of this correction is proportional to $TlogT$, in contrast with
the commutative case, where it goes like $T$. Our results are analytic
functions of the noncommutative parameter.
