The magnetic field redefinition in Jain's composite fermion model for the fractional quantum Hall effect is shown to be effectively described by a mean-field approximation of a model containing a Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field non-minimally coupled to matter.
Also an explicit non-relativistic limit of the non-minimal (2+1)D Dirac equation is derived.
