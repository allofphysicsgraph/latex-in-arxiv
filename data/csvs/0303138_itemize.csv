\item
The notion of enhenced symmetry  already appeared in literature implicitly. 
For example in \cite{hkmm,kdecay}, the notion of $cc,ca$ ring is discussed and 
the chiral ring elements was  described in terms of bosonization.

\item
The weight space is a lattice in torus  of size $n\times n$. 
The identification of weights by modulo $n$ corresponds to shifting string modes.
However, periodicity of the generator $(k_1,k_2)$ is $2n$ and
$(k_1,k_2)$  and  $(k_1,k_2+n)$   do not generate the same theory in general.
We choose the standard range of $k_i$ between $-n+1$ to $n-1$.
This is because the GSO projection depends not only the R-charge
vector $(\{jk_1/n\},\{jk_2/n\})$ but also the G-parity number $G=[jk_1/n]+[jk_2/n]$.
We will comeback to  this when we discuss the GSO projection.

\item
When $n$ and $k_i$  are not relatively prime,
we have a chiral primary whose R-charge vector is $(p/n,0)$.
We call this as the reducible case and eliminate from our interests. 
This is a spectrum that is not completely localized at the tip of the orbifold.
Sometimes, even in the case we started from non-reducible theory, a tachyon condensation leads us to 
the reducible case.

\item     If we condensate an operator with $p=j(1,k)$, its band number 
    $G:=[j/n]+[jk/n]=0$ and $s=0$.  However, $s'=j(1,k)\wedge (k^{-1},1)=-aj\neq 0$ unless
$k=1$ ( or, $a=0$). The  transition is
described as \begin{equation} n(1,k) {\longrightarrow \atop ^{j(1,k)}}
j(1,0)\oplus jk(ja,1) . \end{equation} More explicitly,  for $p=(2,6)$ in
11(1,3), $j=2$, $s=0$, $k=3$, $k^{-1}=4$, $4\cdot 3=11\cdot1+1$
hence $a=1$ and $s'=-2$ so that \begin{equation} 11(1,3) {\longrightarrow \atop
^{(2,6)}} 2(1,0)\oplus 6(2,1) .
 \end{equation} Notice that $6(2,1)$ contains an operator (0,3)
so that this is a reducible orbifold. Even in the case we start with
irreducible orbifold, we can get reducible orbifold as a result of
tachyon condensation. This happen if and only if there is an
operator sitting on the line which connect (0,0) and the
condensing one, $p$.

For later use, we tabulate all possible tachyon condensation
processes for model $11(1,3)$ and $10(1,3)$ in table \ref{t11.3} and table\ref{t10.3}. 
In tables, we should consider only the process by relevant operators,
namely those with $n-(p_1+p_2)>0$, otherwise it is a process by an
irrelevant operator which disappears in the infrared limit.

    \item These theorems are world
sheet fact. The same statement conjectured in \cite{sin} is the GSO projected version
for which we need to take into account the GSO projection. 
However, tachyons in NS-NS sector is not projected out by the type 0 GSO projection,
so the above conclusion is true in type 0 string theory level. For type II
we will  discuss in  detail in next subsection.  

    \item There are two independent theories in the final stage of
tachyon condensation. Each theory will have its own minimal
charges. We should take the smaller of the two, since the minimal
mass of final theory is the minimal over all final spectra.
Namely,  the minimal R-charges of two theories in final stage are not to be added
to compare with the initial one, contrary to the treatment of
$g_{cl}$ in \cite{hkmm}.
    \item  This in fact is equivalent to a conjecture stated
by Dabholkar and Vafa in \cite{dv}. More precisely, the R-charge
here is that in NS sector. The R-charge of Ramond sector is
related to that of NS sector by spectral flow. 
$q_R=q_{NS}-{\hat c}/2$, where
${\hat c}=2$. Since there are CPT invariance in Ramond sector, the
statement that minimal charge increases is equivalent to statement
that maximal charge decreases.  
\footnote{In fact one
can prove this directly:
For notational conveniency, we consider only for the $cc$-ring under the condensation of 
$cc$-ring elements. Namely, we want to show that 
$ {\rm max}_{l=1}^{n-1}
\left(\left\{{lk_1}/{n}\right\} + \left\{{lk_2}/{n}\right\}-1
\right)$ decreases.\\
Let $q_0$ be the minimal R-charge operator of initial theory, and
$q$, say in $\Delta_+$, is the operator whose image $q'=T^+_p(q)$
gives the minimal R-charge of the final theory. Then the maximal
R-charge of the final theory is provided by $(p_1,p_1)-q'$, which
is the image of $p+\vec{OB}-q$. The maximal R-charge  of initial
theory is given by $(n,n)-q_0$. So our goal is to show
$R[(n,n)-q_0]> R[(p_1,p_1)-q']$, which comes from $R[q_0]<R[q']$
proved above.}
