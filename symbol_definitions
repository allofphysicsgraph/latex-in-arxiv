$f$ is the proportionality coefficient,

$v$ is related to elasticity,,

$G$ is the shear modulus,

$K$ is the bulk modulus,

a clear relation was established between the bulk modulus $K$ and the bonding energy $E$: $K=f\\frac{E}{a^3}$,

$\\rho$ is the density,

and we used $m=\\rho a^3$,

in terms of electron mass $m_e$,

the characteristic scale of $v$,

the fine structure constant $\\alpha$,

the same relation for $\\tau_\\hbar$,

the upper bound for $u$,

the upper bound of $v$,

where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.,

In solids, $v$ depends on elastic properties and density.,

The longitudinal speed of sound is $v=\\left({\\frac{M}{\\rho}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$,

We find that $\\frac{v_u}{c}=\\alpha\\left(\\frac{m_e}{2m_p}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$,

and the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\\frac{m_p}{m_e}$,

and the speed of light $\\frac{v_{\\rm F}}{c}$,

the upper bound for the speed of sound in condensed phases, $v_u$,

where $A$ is the atomic,

where $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{e^2}{\\hbar c}$ is the fine structure,

where $a$ is the interatomic separation

where $e$ and $m_e$ are electron charge and mass,

where $m$ is the mass of the atom 

where $u$ is the average speed of sound and
