\item
the constraints one starts with may be reducible of irreducible. As constraints, following 
Berkovits, we choose $\l \g^m \l =0$ because we decompose 
$ (\l^\a d_\a)(z) (\l^b d_\b)(w) \sim ( \l \g^m \l \Pi_m )/(z-w)$ into constraints 
$\l \g^m \l$ and generators $\Pi_m$. Our set of constraints is reducible because there exists 
(field dependent and in general composite) parameters $c_m$ such that $c^m \l g_m \l =0$, 
namely $c_m = (\g_m \l)$. 
\item
One either works at the classical level or at the quantum level. We have been working at the quantum 
level. 
\item
The algebra of first class constraints may contain only first order poles, or also 
second order poles in $z-w$. We did encounter second order poles, but note that 
they were not due to double contractions, but rather to derivatives of first order poles. 
\item
We deviated from the conventional HPT by introducing the antighost $b$. 
It may be that our pair $b, c_z$ has some relation to Jacobians which arise in the 
path integral treatment of WZWN models.
