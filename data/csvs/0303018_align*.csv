Q_\alpha=\psi^\mu_\alpha\pi_\mu\ .

\end{align}\end{subequations}
It is important to realize that operator ordering here is
significant. The Hamiltonian is obtained by the anti-computation of
two super-charges:
\begin{equation} 
\big\{Q_\alpha,Q_\beta\big\ \end{equation}=2\delta_{\alpha\beta}\H\ ,
}
yielding
\begin{equation} 
\H=\frac1{2\sqrt g \end{equation}\pi_\mu\sqrt gg^{\mu\nu}\pi_\nu\ .
}

The Hilbert space of the model is realized in terms of a fermionic
Fock space, with creation operators and annihilation operators given
by the combinations
\begin{equation} 
b^{\mu\dagger \end{equation}=\tfrac1{\sqrt2}(\psi^\mu_1-i\psi^\mu_2)\ ,\qquad
b^{\mu}=\tfrac1{\sqrt2}(\psi^\mu_1+i\psi^\mu_2)\ .
}
The states
\begin{equation} 
f_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_p \end{equation}(X)b^{\mu_1\dagger}\cdots b^{\mu_p\dagger}|0\rangle
}
are in one-to-one correspondence with the de Rahm complex of $\ms$;
for instance, the above state corresponds to the $p$-form
\begin{equation} 
f_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_p \end{equation}(X)\,dX^{\mu_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dX^{\mu_p}\ .
}
Under this correspondence the supercharges $Q_\alpha$ are realized in
terms of the exterior derivative $d$ and its adjoint $d^\dagger$:
\begin{equation} 
Q_1=-\tfrac i{\sqrt2 \end{equation}(d-d^\dagger)\ ,\qquad
Q_2=\tfrac1{\sqrt2}(d+d^\dagger)\ .
}

We now suppose that $\ms$ is a K\""ahler manifold for which $g$ is the
K\""ahler metric. So $\ms$ has a K\""ahler
form $\omega$ that is closed. The K\""ahler metric $g$ is Hermitian with
respect to the complex structure $\BI$ and furthermore 
$g(\BI X, Y)=\omega(X,Y)$, for 2 arbitrary tangent vectors $X$ and $Y$. 
Under these circumstances, it is well known that the quantum
mechanical system admits 2 additional supersymmetries generated by the
supercharges
\begin{equation} 
Q'_\alpha=(\BI\cdot\psi_\alpha)^\mu\pi_\mu\ .
 \end{equation}
Since $\ms$ is a complex manifold we can choose (anti-)holomorphic
coordinates $(z^j,\bar z^j)$, $j=1,\ldots,\tfrac12n$, compatible with
the complex structure: $(\BI\cdot z)^j=iz^j$ and $(\BI\cdot\bar z)^j=
-i\bar z^j$. In this coordinate system, the Hilbert space can be built
on a fermionic Fock space for which 
$\psi_1^j$ and $\bar\psi_2^j$ are the creation operators while
$\bar\psi_1^j$ and $\psi_2^j$ are the annihilation operators. States
in the Hilbert space are naturally identified with elements of the
Dolbeault complex via the correspondence 
\begin{equation}\begin{split} 
&\psi_1^{j_1 \end{split}\end{equation}\cdots\psi_1^{j_p}\bar\psi_2^{k_1}\cdots\bar\psi_2^{k_q}|0\rangle
\longleftrightarrow 
dz^{j_1}\wedge\cdots\wedge dz^{j_p}\wedge d\bar z^{k_1}\wedge\cdots
d\bar z^{k_q}\ .}

Since $\ms$ is K\""ahler, we can add a kind of mass for one of the
species of fermions to the Lagrangian:
\begin{equation} 
\L_m=-\tfrac12 m
\omega(\psi_2,\psi_2)+c=-\tfrac12m\psi^\mu_2\omega_{\mu\nu \end{equation}\psi_2^\nu+c
=-\tfrac 12m\psi_{2\mu}(\BI\cdot\psi_2)^\mu+c\ ,
\label{pert}
}
where $m$ is a parameter. In the application to instantons, such a
term was derived in the effective quantum mechanics on the moduli
space in \cite{review}. In the monopole application, such a term can be
extracted indirectly from \cite{Gauntlett:2000ks}, by choosing the
matter content of the $\N=2$ theory to transform in the adjoint
representation. In both cases $m$ is the mass of the adjoint
hypermultiplet in the parent theory.

The term \eqref{pert} is only invariant under half the original 
supersymmetries; namely those generated by $Q_1$ and $Q'_1$, 
following from the fact that the K\""ahler form is
covariantly constant on a K\""ahler manifold. In \eqref{pert}, $c$ is a
constant that arises via a normal ordering prescription and its value 
is fixed as follows. In the canonical formalism, we require that
the term \eqref{pert} leads to a modification of the Hamiltonian operator of
the normal-ordered form
\begin{equation} 
\H'=\H+\H_m\ ,\qquad\H_m=\tfrac12 m:\psi_{2\mu \end{equation}(\BI\cdot\psi_2)^\mu:\ ,
\label{perth}
}
in order that it annihilates the vacuum state $|0\rangle$. 
Notice in the language of the Dolbeault complex, $\H_m$, up
to the factor of $m$, simply counts the anti-holomorphic
degree. Ensuring that \eqref{pert} leads to \eqref{perth}, fixes
\begin{equation} 
c=mn/2\ .
 \end{equation}
With the mass term added, the supersymmetry algebra gains a central
charge:
\begin{equation} 
Q_1^2=\H'-\Z\ ,\qquad Q_1^{\prime2 \end{equation}=\H'-\Z\ ,\qquad\big\{Q_1,Q'_1\big\}=0\ ,
}
where it is immediately apparent---since $Q_1$ is unchanged---that 
\begin{equation} 
\Z=\H_m\ .
 \end{equation}

The question is what does the modification do to the Witten Index of the
model? Since we have remarked that $\H_m$
has a very simple action on the Dolbeault
complex---it simply counts the anti-holomorphic degree of a
form multiplied by $m$---the Witten Index of the deformed
system will be given by
\begin{equation} 
{\rm ind \end{equation}_W=\sum_{i,j}(-1)^{i+j}b_{i,j}e^{-\beta m j}\ ,
\label{witi}
}
where $b_{i,j}$ are the Betti numbers of the Dolbeault complex with $i$
and $j$ being the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic degrees,
respectively.

So the addition of the term \eqref{pert} or \eqref{perth}, 
which breaks half the
supersymmetry, is to deform the index. When $m=0$ we recover the Euler
characteristic. In the limit, $m\to\infty$, the index reduces to the
arithmetic or Todd genus $\sum_{i}(-1)^ib_{i,0}$. In fact the interpolating
quantity \eqref{witi} is the $\chi_y$-genus of Hirzebruch \cite{Hirz}
\begin{equation} 
\chi_y=\sum_{i,j \end{equation}(-1)^iy^jb_{i,j}\ ,\qquad y=-e^{-\beta m}\ .
}
Now we see how it can naturally be obtained from a deformed quantum
mechanical supersymmetric $\sigma$-model. Note that the $\chi_y$-genus
has also been related to supersymmetric quantum mechanics in \cite{meng},
via a twisted of the boundary conditions on the fermions. Our
approach obtained by adding the deformation \eqref{pert}, motivated by 
the application to soliton dynamics, is different. In related work,
a geometric interpretation of the $\chi_y$-genus has
been given for hyper-K\""ahler geometries in
\cite{Thompson:1999iw,Thompson:1998vx}. In particular, this is
relevant for the application of our results to soliton quantization
for which the relevant geometry is hyper-K\""ahler. 

It remains to derive the known 
integral expression for the $\chi_y$-genus by
computing the partition function of the deformed quantum mechanical
system. The steps are a simple generalization of the standard
derivation of index densities of supersymmetric quantum mechanics \cite{AG}.
As usual the Witten Index can be calculated by computing the Euclidean
functional integral with fields being periodic in $t$. We define
$\beta$ to be the period. The resulting functional integral expression is then 
independent of $\beta$---apart from via the
combination $\beta m$---and may be readily evaluated in the limit
$\beta\to0$ (with fixed $\beta m$). 
In this limit, constant configurations of $X^\mu(t)$ and
$\psi_\alpha^\mu(t)$ 
dominate the functional integral and one can integrate out the
fluctuations to Gaussian order. 
To this end we expand around constant configurations: 
\begin{equation}  
X^\mu\ra
x^\mu+\delta X^\mu(t)\ ,\qquad
\psi^\mu_\a\ra\eta^\mu_\a+\delta\psi^\mu_\a(t)\ .
 \end{equation}
We can now 
integrate out the fluctuations separately and this is greatly
facilitated by choosing at each 
$x^\mu$ normal co-ordinates for which:
\begin{equation} 
g_{\mu\nu \end{equation}(x)=\delta_{\mu\nu}+{\cal O}(\delta X^2)\ .
%\Ga^\mu_{\nu\sigma}(x)=\tfrac12 R^\mu_{\nu\rho\sigma}(x)\delta
%X^\rho(t)+{\cal O}(\delta X^2)\ .
\label{nc}
}
The Euclidean action then splits in two:
\begin{equation} 
S=S_c+\int_0^\b dt\, \L_f\ .
 \end{equation}
The constant part is
\begin{equation} 
S_c=-\tfrac14\beta
R_{\mu\nu\sigma\rho \end{equation}\eta^\mu_1\eta^\nu_1\eta^\sigma_2\eta^\rho_2
+\tfrac12\beta m\eta^\mu_2\om_{\mu\nu}\eta^\nu_2+\tfrac12\beta nm\ ,
}
where the final term arises from the normal-ordering constant in \eqref{pert}.
This expression implies that the fermions zero-modes $\eta_1^\mu$ scale
like $\beta^{-1/2}$, while $\eta_2^\mu$ do not scale with $\beta$
(remember that $\beta m$ is fixed). The fluctuation part is then 
\begin{equation} 
\L_f=\tfrac12 \delta
X^\mu \De^B_{\mu\nu \end{equation}\delta X^\nu
+\tfrac{1}{2}\delta\psi^\mu\Delta^F_{\mu\nu}\delta\psi^\nu+\cdots\ ,
}
where the ellipsis represent non-Gaussian terms which only contribute
at a higher order in $\beta$ and hence can be ignored. Using the fact
that in normal coordinates \eqref{nc}
\begin{equation} 
\psi^\mu_1\Gamma_{\mu\sigma\rho \end{equation}(X)\dot X^\sigma\psi^\rho_1
=\tfrac12\delta
X^\mu R_{\mu\nu\sigma\rho}(x)\eta^\sigma_1\eta^\rho_1\delta\dot X^\nu+\cdots
}
to leading order and up to total derivatives, the bosonic operator is
\begin{equation} 
\De^B_{\mu\nu \end{equation}=-\delta_{\mu\nu}\d_t^2-
\tfrac{1}{2}R_{\mu\nu\sigma\rho}\eta^\sigma_1\eta^\rho_1\d_t+\cdots\ ,
} 
to leading order in $\beta$. The fermionic operator is matrix-valued:
\begin{equation}  
\De^F_{\mu\nu \end{equation}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\delta_{\mu\nu}\d_t
& 0\\ 0 &
\delta_{\mu\nu}\d_t+\frac{1}{2}R_{\mu\nu\sigma\rho}\eta^\sigma_1\eta^\rho_1
-\beta m\om_{\mu\nu}
\end{array}\right)+\cdots\ ,
}
to leading order in $\beta$.

We can now integrate out the fluctuations $\delta X^\mu$ and $\delta\psi^\mu$,
as well as the constant modes $\eta_2^\mu$ keeping careful track of
the overall normalization of the functional integral. As usual we can
write the resulting integral over $X^\mu$ and $\eta_1^\mu$ as an
integral over differential forms by identifying
$\eta_1^\mu=dX^\mu$. Finally we have
\begin{equation} 
{\rm ind \end{equation}_W=
\Big(\frac i{2\pi}\Big)^{n/2}e^{-n\beta m/2}\int_\ms
    {\rm det}^{1/2}\left(\frac{R/2
\sinh(R/2-\beta m\om/2 )}
{\sinh(R/2)}\right)\ ,
}
where $R$ is the matrix-valued curvature 2-form. This can be written as 
\begin{equation} 
{\rm
  ind \end{equation}_W=\int_{\ms}\prod_{i=1}^{n/2}\frac{x_i(1+ye^{-x_i})}{1-e^{-x_i}}\ ,
}
where $x_i$ are the skew eigenvalues of $R/4\pi$ and
$y=-e^{-\beta m}$. This reproduces the integral form for the $\chi_y$
genus \cite{Hirz}.
