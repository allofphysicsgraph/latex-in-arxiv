% \bf Abstract 
\begin{abstract}
We study the regularization of theories of ``brane induced'' 
gravity in codimension $N>1$. 
The brane can be interpreted as a thin  dielectric with a 
large dielectric constant, embedded in a higher dimensional space.
The kinetic term for the 
higher dimensional graviton is enhanced over the brane.
A four  dimensional gravitation is found on the brane at 
distances smaller  than a critical distance $r<r_c$, 
and is due to the exchange of a massive resonant graviton. 
The crossover scale $r_c$  is determined by the mass of the resonance. 
The suppression of the couplings of light 
Kaluza-Klein modes to brane matter results in a 
higher dimensional force law at large distances. 
We show that the resulting theory is free of ghosts or tachyons.
