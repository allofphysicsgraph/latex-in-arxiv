\item The maximally symmetric attractive homogeneous plane wave.  An
example is the BFHP plane wave \cite{BFHP} which arises from a Penrose
limit of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ and has been of much recent interest in
string theory, beginning with the work of BMN \cite{BMN}.

\item Homogeneous plane waves violating all positive energy
conditions.  These are unphysical.

\item All other homogeneous plane waves, including many
\cite{11d,ads4,Cvetic,Bena,Michelson,usc,leo,durham} of interest to
string theory, such as those arising from Penrose limits of $AdS_4
\times S^7$ \cite{ads4}.  Here the causal boundary matches that of
case 1, but using $\bar {\cal T}$ spacelike infinity turns out to be
larger in the sense described below.

$N$ such that $x \in I^-(x_n)$ for all $n > N$, and

Given $x  \notin Cl[I^-(\lim \ s)]$, there exists
an integer $N$ such that, $x \not\in Cl[I^-(x_n)]$ for all $n > N$,
