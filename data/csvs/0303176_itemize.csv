${\cal H}$
is a Hilbert space of Fock type (associated to some one-particle Hilbert space
describing some choice of elementary particles) with the scalar product
$(\cdot, \cdot)$;
\item
$\Omega \in {\cal H}$
is a special vector called the vacuum;
\item
$U_{a,A}$ 
is a unitary irreducible representation of 
$inSL(2,\C)$
the universal covering group of the proper orthochronous Poincar\'e group such
that 
$a \in \R^{4}$ 
is translation in the Minkowski space and 
$A \in SL(2,\C)$;
\item
$U \mapsto V_{U}$
is a unitary representation of the compact group $G$ (usually
$SU(N)$
or 
$SO(N)$);
$V_{U}$
commutes with
$U_{a,A}$

$b_{J}, \quad J = 1,\dots,N_{B}$ (resp. $f_{A}, \quad A = 1,\dots,N_{F}$)
are the quantum free fields of integer (resp. half-integer) spin. We assume
that the fields are linearly independent up to equations of motion;
\item
The  equations of motion do not connect distinct fields. 
\"

\item
From the compatibility of (\ref{tensor}) with Lorentz transformations it
follows that these polynomials are Lorentz covariant.
\item
The equation of motion are supersymmetric invariant, i.e. if we take the 
commutator of the supercharges
$Q_{ja}$
and
$\bar{Q}_{k\bar{a}}$
with the equations for the Bosonic fields we obtain zero modulo the equation
of motion for the Fermionic fields and vice-versa.
\item
To verify the validity of (\ref{SUSY}) it is necessary and sufficient to prove
they commute with all the fields 
$b$ and $f$
of the model: 
\bea
~[ \{ Q_{ja} , Q_{kb} \} - \epsilon_{ab} Z_{jk}, b ] = 0, \quad
[ \{ Q_{a} , \bar{Q}_{\bar{b}} \} - 2 \sigma^{\mu}_{a\bar{b}} P_{\mu} , b ] = 0
\nonumber \\
~[ \{ Q_{a} , Q_{b} \} - \epsilon_{ab} Z_{jk}, f ] = 0, \quad
[ \{ Q_{a} , \bar{Q}_{\bar{b}} \} - 2 \sigma^{\mu}_{a\bar{b}} P_{\mu} , f]  = 0;
\eea
this follows from (\ref{vac}) and the fact that the Hilbert space is generated 
by vectors of the type
\bea
\Psi = b_{J_{1}}(x_{1}) \cdots b_{J_{p}}(x_{p}) 
f_{A_{1}}(y_{1}) \cdots f_{A_{q}}(y_{q}) \Omega \in {\cal H}.
\label{hilbert}
\eea

Using the (graded) Jacobi identities it follows that we must check:
\bea  
\left\{ Q_{ja} , [ Q_{kb}, b ] \right\}  
- \left\{ Q_{kb} , [ b, Q_{ja} ] \right\} 
+ [ b , \epsilon_{ab} Z_{jk} ] = 0
\nonumber \\
\left[ Q_{ja} , \{ Q_{kb}, f \} \right] 
+ \left[ Q_{kb} , \{ f, Q_{ja} \} \right] 
+ [ f, \epsilon_{ab} Z_{jk} ] = 0
\nonumber \\
\left\{ Q_{ja} , [ \bar{Q}_{\bar{kb}}, b ] \right\} 
- \{ \bar{Q}_{\bar{kb}} , [ b, Q_{ja} ] \} 
+ [ b, 2 \delta{jk} \sigma^{\mu}_{a\bar{b}} P_{\mu} ] = 0
\nonumber \\
\left[ Q_{ja} , \{ \bar{Q}_{\bar{kb}}, f \} \right] 
+ [ \bar{Q}_{k\bar{b}} , \{ f, Q_{ja} \} ] 
+ [ f, 2 \delta{jk} \sigma^{\mu}_{a\bar{b}} P_{\mu} ] = 0.
\label{jacobi1}
\eea
\item
Causal (anti)commutation relations are verified by the free fields
$b$ and $f$:
\bea
~[ b(x), b(y) ] = - i p(\partial) D(x-y) \qquad
\{ f(x), f(y) \} = - i q(\partial) D(x-y)
\eea
where $D$ is Pauli-Jordan causal distribution. Reasoning as above it follows
that new consistency relations are valid following again from (graded) Jacobi 
identities; the non-trivial ones are:
\bea
[ b(x), \{ f(y), Q_{ja} \} ] + \{ f(y), [ Q_{ja}, b(x) ] \} = 0
\label{jacobi2}
\eea
\item
If one considers higher-spin fields (more precisely
$s \geq 1$),
is necessary to extend 
somewhat this framework: one considers in 
${\cal H}$
besides the usual positive definite scalar product a non-degenerate 
sesqui-linear form
$<\cdot, \cdot>$
which becomes positively defined when restricted to a factor Hilbert space
$Ker(Q)/Im(Q)$
where $Q$ is some {\it gauge charge}. We denote with
$A^{\dagger}$
the adjoint of the operator $A$ with respect to
$<\cdot, \cdot>$.

The gauge supercharge $Q$ it is usually determined by relations of the type 
(\ref{tensor}) involving ghost fields also, so it means that we must impose 
consistency relations of the same type as above. Moreover, it is desirable to 
have
\be
\{ Q, Q_{ja} \} = 0, \quad \{ Q, \bar{Q}_{j\bar{a}} \} = 0;
\label{susy-gauge}
\ee
this implies that the supersymmetric charges
$Q_{ja}$
and
$\bar{Q}_{j\bar{a}}$
factorizes to the physical Hilbert space
${\cal H}_{phys} = Ker(Q)/Im(Q)$.
This implies new consistency relations of the type (\ref{jacobi1})
with one of the supercharges replaced by the gauge charge:
\bea  
~\left\{ Q_{ja} , [ Q, b ] \right\} + \left\{ Q , [ Q_{ja}, b ] \right\} = 0
\qquad
~\left[ Q_{ja} , \{ Q, f \} \right] + \left[ Q, \{ Q_{ja}, f \} \right] = 0.
\label{jacobi3}
\eea
\item
A relation of the type (\ref{jacobi3}) must be also valid for the 
gauge charge:
\bea
[ b(x), \{ f(y), Q \} ] + \{ f(y), [ {Q}, b(x) ] \} = 0.
\label{jacobi4}
\eea
\item
To have
$Q^{2} = 0$
we must also impose
\be
~\{ Q, [Q , b ] \} = 0 \qquad [ Q, \{ Q, f \} ] = 0.
