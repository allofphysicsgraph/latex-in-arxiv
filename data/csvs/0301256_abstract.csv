Hamiltonian systems with linearly dependent constraints (irregular
systems), are classified according to their behavior in the vicinity of the
constraint surface. For these systems, the standard Dirac procedure is not
directly applicable. However, Dirac's treatment can be slightly modified to
obtain, in some cases, a Hamiltonian description completely equivalent to
the Lagrangian one. A recipe to deal with the different cases is provided,
along with a few pedagogical examples.
