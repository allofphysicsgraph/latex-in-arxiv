The gauge symmetries of a general dynamical system can be systematically obtained following either a Hamiltonean or a Lagrangean approach. In the
former case, these symmetries are generated, according to Dirac's
conjecture, by the first class constraints. In the latter approach
such local symmetries are reflected in the existence of so called gauge identities. The connection between the two becomes apparent, if one works with a first order Lagrangean formulation. 
We thereby confirm Dirac's conjecture. Our analysis applies to arbitrary
constrained systems with first and second class constraints, and thus extends
a previous analysis by one of the authors to such general systems.
We illustrate our general results in terms of several examples.
