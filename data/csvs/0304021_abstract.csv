We evaluate the spectral function of scalar and spinor propagator in three
dimensional quantum electrodynamics with the use of Ward-Identity for
soft-photon emission vertex.We work well in position space to treat infrared
divergences in our model. Exponentiation of one-photon matrix element yields a
full propagator in position space.It has asimple form as free propagator
multiplied by quantum correction.But this is not an integrable function so
that analysis in momentum space is not easy.Term by term integral converges
and they have a logarithmic singularity associated with renormalized mass in
perturbation theory$.$Renormalization constant vanishes for weak
coupling,which suggests confinement of charged particle.There exsists a
critical coupling constant below which bare mass vanishes and the vacuum
expectation value of pair condensation is finite.
