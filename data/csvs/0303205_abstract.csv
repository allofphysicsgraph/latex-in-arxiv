The alternating integrable spin chain and the $RSOS(q_{1},q_{2};p)$ model in
the presence of a quantum impurity are investigated. The boundary
free energy due to the impurity is derived, the ratios of the
corresponding $g$ functions at low and high temperature are
specified and their relevance to boundary flows in unitary minimal
and generalized coset models is discussed. Finally, the
alternating spin chain with diagonal and non--diagonal integrable
boundaries is studied, and the corresponding boundary free energy
and $g$ functions are derived.
