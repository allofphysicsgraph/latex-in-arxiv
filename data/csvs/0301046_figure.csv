 Shape of ${\cal G}(x)$ and ${\cal F}(y)$ for the

The allowed range of $x$ is between $x_\mathrm{s}$ and

range of $y$ is restricted to $-x\leq y < +\infty$. The presence
of an accelerated horizon (which coincides with the cosmological
horizon and has a non-spherical shape) is indicated by $h_A$ and
the Schwarzschild-like horizon by $h_m$. For completeness we
comment on two other cases studied in the text: for
$27m^2A^2=1-9m^2\Lambda$ (case (ii) in the text), ${\cal F}(y)$ is
zero at its local maximum, i.e., $h_A$ and $h_m$ coincide. For
$27m^2A^2>1-9m^2\Lambda$ (case (iii) in the text), ${\cal F}(y)$
is always negative in the allowed range of $y$.
