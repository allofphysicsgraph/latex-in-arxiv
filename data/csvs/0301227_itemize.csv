\item $\kappa=0$:
the spectrum of the inverted oscillator is given by the expression
(\ref{cos}),
where ${\cal E} < 1$ .
Hence, when ${\cal E}>0$, the inverted oscillator transmutes into
a one-dimensional harmonic one, and the system possesses a ground state.
For ${\cal E}=0$ the energy of the system vanishes.

\item  $\kappa<0 $: the Hamiltonian
of the inverted oscillator can be diagonalized by
a $SU(2)$
transformation.
The resulting system is again given by (\ref{t3}), where
$\omega_+ >0$, $\omega_-<0$.
\item $\kappa>0$, $(\kappa +{\cal E})^2 > 4\kappa $ (or, equivalently,
$\kappa \in [\; 0,\;
 \left(1-{\omega\theta}\right)^2 ]\;\cup\; [
\left(1+{\omega\theta}\right)^2,\infty ]$ .\\
In this case, we can diagonalize  the Hamiltonian
by an appropriate $SU(1.1)$ transformation.
The energy spectrum is defined by  by (\ref{t3}), where
$$
\begin{array}{cc}
\omega_+>0,\quad \omega_-<0 &{\rm for}\; {\cal E}>\kappa \\
\omega_+<0,\quad \omega_->0 &{\rm for}\; {\cal E}<\kappa\;.
\end{array}
$$
Hence, although the spectrum is discrete, the system has no ground state.
This regime also appears in the absence of a magnetic field, i.e. for $B=0$,
when ${\cal E}<-3$.
In this case the ``frequencies'' are
$\omega_\pm=0,\;\; 2(\omega\theta)^2$.

\item  $\kappa>0$, $(\kappa +{\cal E})^2 \leq 4\kappa $ (or, equivalently,
$\kappa \in [ \left(1-{\omega\theta}\right)^2\;,
\left(1+{\omega\theta}\right)^2\; ]$).\\
In this case we cannot diagonalize the Hamiltonian,
neither by $SU(1.1)$, nor by $SU(2)$ transformations.
This indicates that in the given regime
the system possesses a smooth energy spectrum.
Notice that this is the only regime which has commutative limit.
