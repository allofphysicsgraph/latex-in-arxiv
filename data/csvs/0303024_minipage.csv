We discuss type IIB orientifolds with D-branes, and NSNS and RR field 
strength fluxes. The D-brane sectors lead to open string spectra with 
non-abelian gauge symmetry and charged chiral fermions. The closed string 
field strengths generate a scalar potential stabilizing most moduli. We 
describe the construction of models with $\NN=1$ supersymmetric 
subsectors in the context of orientifolds of IIB theory on 
$\IT^6/(\IZ_2\times \IZ_2)$, containing 
D9-branes with world-volume magnetic fluxes, and illustrate model 
building possibilities with several explicit examples. We comment on 
a T-dual picture with D8-branes on non-Calabi-Yau half-flat geometries,
and discuss some of the topological properties of such configurations.
We also explore the construction of models with fluxes and with D3-branes 
at singularities and present a non-supersymmetric 3-family $SU(5)$ model.
