We study exclusive scattering of `hadrons' at high energy and
fixed angle in (nonconformal) noncommutative gauge theories. Via
gauge-string duality, we show that the noncommutativity renders
the scattering soft, leading to exponential suppression. The
result fits with the picture that, in noncommutative gauge theory,
fundamental parton contents constitute wee-partons only and
`hadrons' are made out of open Wilson lines.
