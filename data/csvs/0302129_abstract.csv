We consider solutions of six dimensional Einstein equations with
two compact dimensions. It is shown that one can introduce
3-branes in this background in such a way that the effective four
dimensional cosmological constant is completely independent of the
brane tensions. These tensions are completely arbitrary, without
requiring any fine tuning. We must, however, fine tune bulk
parameters in order to obtain a sufficiently small value for the
observable cosmological constant. We comment in the effective four
dimensional description of this effect at energies below the
compactification scale.
