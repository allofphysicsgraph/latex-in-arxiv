We study a set of chiral symmetries contained in degenerate operators beyond the `minimal' sector of the $c_{p,q}$ models. For the operators $h_{(2j+2)q-1,1}=h_{1,(2j+2)p-1}$ at conformal weight $\left[ (j+1)p-1 \right] \left[ (j+1)q -1 \right]$, for every $2j \in \mathbf{N}$, we find $2j+1$ chiral operators which have quantum numbers of a spin $j$ representation of $SU(2)$. We give a free-field construction of these operators which makes this structure explicit and allows their OPEs to be calculated directly without any use of screening charges. The first non-trivial chiral field in this series, at $j=\half$, is a fermionic or parafermionic doublet. The three chiral bosonic fields, at $j=1$, generate a closed $W$-algebra and we calculate the vacuum character of these triplet models.
