{\bf Abstract.}
Being gauge non-invariant, a Chern--Simons $(2k-1)$-form seen as a 
Lagrangian of gauge theory on 
a $(2k-1)$-dimensional manifold leads to the gauge conservation law of a
modified Noether current.

One usually considers the Chern--Simons (henceforth CS) gauge theory on
a principal bundle over a 3-dimensional manifold whose 
Lagrangian is the local 
CS form derived from the local
transgression formula for the second Chern form. 
This Lagrangian fails to be globally defined unless the above mentioned
principal bundle is trivial. Though the local CS Lagrangian is not
gauge-invariant, it leads to a (local) conservation law of the modified
Noether current \cite{bor98,book,sard97}. This result is also extended 
to the global CS theory on a 3-dimensional manifold \cite{al,bor2}. 
Its Lagrangian is well defined, but depends on a background gauge
potential. Therefore, it is gauge-covariant.
At the same time, the corresponding Euler--Lagrange operator 
is gauge invariant, and the above mentioned gauge
conservation law takes place. We aim to show that any higher-dimensional
CS theory admits such a conservation law.

There is the following general scheme of describing Lagrangian systems
on fibre bundles whose Euler--Lagrange operators are gauge-invariant,
but Lagrangians need not be so \cite{infin} (see also \cite{bor}).  

Let $Y\to X$ be a smooth fibre bundle over an $n$-dimensional base $X$.
An $r$-order Lagrangian is defined as a density $L={\cal L} d^nx$
on the $r$-order jet manifold $J^rY$ of sections of $Y\to X$
(e.g., \cite{book,epr}). Let $u$
be a vertical vector field on $Y\to X$ seen as 
an infinitesimal generator of a 
local one-parameter group of vertical bundle
automorphisms (gauge transformations) of $Y\to X$. Let $J^ru$ be 
its prolongation onto $J^rY\to X$. The following three formulas are
called into play.

(i) Let ${\bf L}_{J^ru}L$ denote the Lie derivative of $L$
along $J^ru$. The first variational formula provides its
canonical decomposition"
