We construct consistent non-linear Kaluza Klein reduction ansatze for
a subset of fields arising from the reduction of IIB$^*$ and M$^*$ theory
on dS$_5\times H^5$ and dS$_4\times$AdS$_7$, respectively.  These reductions
yield four and five-dimensional de Sitter supergravities, albeit with wrong
sign kinetic terms.  We also demonstrate that the ansatze may be used to
lift multi-centered de Sitter black hole solutions to ten and eleven
dimensions.  The lifted dS$_5$ black holes correspond to rotating E4-branes
of IIB$^*$ theory.
