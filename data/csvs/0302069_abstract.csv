We consider a brane scenario with a massive scalar field in the 
five-dimensional bulk. We study the scalar states that are localized on 
the brane, which is assumed to be de Sitter. These localized scalar modes 
are massive in general, their effective 
four-dimensional mass depending on the mass of the 
five-dimensional scalar field, on the Hubble parameter in the brane and on 
the coupling between the brane tension and the bulk scalar field. We then 
introduce a purely four-dimensional approach based on an effective 
potential for the projection of the scalar field in the  brane, and discuss 
its regime of validity. Finally, we explore the quasi-localized scalar 
states, which have a non-zero width that quantifies their probability of 
tunneling from the brane into the bulk.
