Nonperturbative treatments of the UV limit of pure gravity
suggest that it admits a stable fixed point with positive
Newton's constant and cosmological constant.
We prove that this result is stable under the addition of 
a scalar field with a generic potential
and nonminimal couplings to the scalar curvature.
There is a fixed point where the mass 
and all nonminimal scalar interactions vanish while 
the gravitational couplings have values which are almost 
identical to the pure gravity case.
We discuss the linearized flow around this fixed point
and find that the critical surface is four-dimensional.
In the presence of other, arbitrary, massless minimally 
coupled matter fields, the existence of the fixed point,
the sign of the cosmological constant and the dimension of the
critical surface depend on the type and number of fields. 
In particular, for some matter content,
there exist polynomial asymptotically
free scalar potentials, thus providing a 
solution to the well-known problem of triviality.
