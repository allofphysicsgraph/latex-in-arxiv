We study the gauged sigma model and its mirror Landau-Ginsburg model corresponding to 
type IIA on the  Fermat degree-24 hypersurface in
${\bf WCP}^4[1,1,2,8,12]$ (whose blow-up gives the smooth $CY_3(3,243)$) 
away from the orbifold singularities, and its orientifold by a freely-acting
antiholomorphic involution.
We derive  the Picard-Fuchs equation obeyed by the period integral as defined
in \cite{C,HV}, of the parent ${\cal N}=2$ type IIA theory of \cite{KV} We obtain
the Meijer's basis of solutions to the equation in the large {\it and}
 small complex structure limits (on the mirror Landau-Ginsburg side)
of the abovementioned Calabi-Yau, and make some remarks about the monodromy properties 
associated based on \cite{Morrison}, at the same and another MATHEMATICAlly interesting
point.  Based on a recently shown ${\cal N}=1$ four-dimensional triality \cite{tri1}
between Heterotic on the self-mirror Calabi-Yau $CY_3(11,11)$, 
$M$ theory on ${CY_3(3,243)\times S^1\over{\bf Z}_2}$ and 
$F$-theory on an elliptically fibered $CY_4$ with the base given by ${\bf CP}^1\times$
Enriques surface, we first give a heuristic argument 
that there can be no superpotential generated in the orientifold of 
of $CY_3(3,243)$,
 and then explicitly verify the same using mirror symmetry formulation of \cite{HV}
for the abovementioned hypersurface away from its orbifold singularities. We 
then discuss briefly the sigma model and the mirror Landau-Ginsburg model
corresponding to the resolved Calabi-Yau as well.
