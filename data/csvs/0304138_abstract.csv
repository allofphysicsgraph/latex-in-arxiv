We derive the Konishi anomaly equations for ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge
theories based on the classical gauge groups with matter in 
two-index tensor and fundamental representations, thus 
extending the existing results for $U(N)$.
%
A general formula is obtained which expresses  solutions to the Konishi
anomaly equation in terms of solutions to the loop equations of the
corresponding matrix model.
%
This provides an alternative to the diagrammatic proof that the
perturbative part of the glueball superpotential $W_{\rm eff}$ for these
matter representations can be computed from matrix model integrals, and
further shows that the two approaches always give the same result.  The
anomaly approach is found to be computationally more efficient in the
cases we studied.
% The anomaly approach is found to be computationally more efficient, and
% allows a more straightforward generalization to other matter contents.
%
Also, we show in the anomaly approach how theories with a traceless
two-index tensor can be solved using an associated theory with a
traceful tensor and appropriately chosen coupling constants.
