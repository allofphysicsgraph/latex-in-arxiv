\caption{Equipotential curves for $p=2$ and $\lambda = 1$.  The dots
mark the positions of the local minimum $(0, -0.246)$ which is the
true vacuum of the theory, the saddle point $(0, 1.07)$ which is
interpreted as a flat spacetime with no D-brane, and the local maximum
$(1, 1)$ corresponding to a D-brane filling all of spacetime.}

\caption{Numerical solution for the double lump of codimension one,
with $p=2$ and $\lambda = 1/2$. The thick black line is $\phi(x)$ and
the thick gray line is $\psi(x)$. For comparison, we show, in dashed
lines, the solutions for $\lambda = 0$. We note that $\psi(x)$ tends
to its asymptotic value very fast, This is in contrast to the case of
the single lump of $\phi$, which causes oscillations of $\psi$ (see
Section \ref{s_back_reaction}). This is related to the fact that
closed string modes do not propagate outside the double lump.}

\caption{Time evolution of the coupled open-closed tachyon system drawn in the $(\phi,\psi)$ plane.
The system starts its evolution in the infinite past at the point $(1,1)$, reaching the point 
$\phi=0$ around $t \sim 0$. For this picture we have chosen $p=2$ and $\lambda = 0.001$, 
to indicate that even at very  small coupling the exponential ansatz (\ref{doublerollingansatz}) 
leads to condensation of both tachyons.
