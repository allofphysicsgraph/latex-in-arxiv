      Despite great advances in superstring theory, multiloop amplitudes
      are still unavailable,
almost twenty years after the derivation of the one-loop amplitudes by
Green and Schwarz
for Type II strings and by Gross et al. for heterotic strings.
The main obstacle is
the presence of supermoduli for worldsheets of non-trivial topology. 
Considerable
efforts had been made by many authors in order to overcome this 
obstacle, and a chaotic
situation ensued, with many competing prescriptions proposed in 
the literature. These
prescriptions drew from a variety of fundamental principles such 
as BRST invariance and
the picture-changing formalism, descent equations and Cech cohomology, modular
invariance, the light-cone gauge, the global geometry of the Teichmueller curve,
the unitary gauge, the operator formalism, group theoretic methods,
factorization, and algebraic supergeometry. However, the basic problem was that
gauge-fixing required a local gauge slice, and the prescriptions ended 
up depending on the
choice of such slices, violating gauge invariance. At the most 
pessimistic end, this raised
the undesirable possibility that superstring amplitudes could be ambiguous, 
and that it
may be necessary to consider other options, such as the Fischler-Susskind
mechanism\cite{DP}.
