\section{A thorough analyzing on particle horizon problem in inflation model}
 
Without inflation, we know the size of observed universe is $10^{30}$ times to size of casual connected region when we trace back to Planck time. If we think the size of observed universe to be the $same$ size of the presently observable universe, or equavently the present particle horizon, which requires there exists an epoch when the proportion of enlargement factor of $a$ to the enlargement factor of $H_{ph}$ is $10^{30}$, we see the inflation model can't do its work. We need restudy the obsevered universe and the observable universe counting inflation. The contents of observed universe ,such as galaxies and CMB, are all formed quite after inflation. The distances of far celestial bodies are  measured with methods not affected by physical procession before the formation of these bodies. So the size of observed universe in big bang model is as the same as the size of observed universe in inflation model.  But the age of the universe and the observable universe are different. They rely on the whole procession of the universe, from big bang to now. So it is necessory to investigate the influence of inserted inflation on the them. From the following proofs we can see the infaltion hardly do any work on the age of the universe and may do some work on the observable universe. 

Let us consider the solution of Friedmann equation with arbitrary constants on condition that matter dominates. Because the properties of radiation dominated epoch is much alike the the properties of radiation dominated epoch comparing to the properties of vacuum dominated epoch. we may use the equations for matter dominated to substitute equations for radiation dominated for estimation. 

\begin{equation}
D_b(t)=(B_1t+B_2)^{2/3},
\end{equation}
where $D_b(t)$ is the size of presently observed universe at time $t$,$ B_1 $ and $B_2$ are arbitrary constants decided by boundary conditions.

\begin{equation}
D_b(t_n)=(B_1t_n+B_2)^{2/3},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
D_b(t_e)=(B_1t_e+B_2)^{2/3},
\end{equation}

where $t_n$ is the time from big bang to now (considering inflation), $t_e$ is the time when inflation ends. Here we think the matter dominated epoch begin at $t_e$ for estimation. If we exclude inflation ,the equation can be written as, roughly thinking matter dominating through all universe history,

\begin{equation}
D_b(t)=D_b(t_n)(\frac{t}{t_n})^{2/3}.
\end{equation}

It is easy to obtain

\begin{equation}
t_n=\frac{2}{3}\frac{\frac{dD_b}{dt}}{D_b}=\frac{2}{3}H^{-1}(now),
\end{equation}

It is obviously that only if we can proof that $\frac{\frac{B_2}{B_1}}{t_n}$ is a small quantity we proof the inflation's inflence on the age (which is caculated by Hubble constant) can be literally ommited. In fact, from Eq.(23) and Eq.(24)

\begin{equation}
\frac{B_1t_n+B_2}{B_1t_e+B_2}=(z+1)^{3/2},
\end{equation}

then

\begin{equation}
(z+1)^{3/2}-1=\frac{t_n-t_e}{t_e+\frac{B_2}{B_1}}<\frac{t_n}{t_e+\frac{B_2}{B_1}}<\frac{t_n}{\frac{B_2}{B_1}},
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[totalheight=3.5in]{hand.eps}
\caption{The size of particle horizon vs the size of obseverd universe } 
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

where $z$ is redshift factor, which is much larger than redshift factor of CMB(1100), because the end of inflation is much earlier than the CMB decoupling. So the age of our universe can also be denoted by Hubble constant in inflation model. To the particle horizon thing is different. Based on the Section 2 the caculation is straightforward. The result is plotted on the figure 1, which is just a sketch. The curve which is upper at the end of time represents particle horizon and the other represents prensently observed universe. We give a summary on the particle horizon problem and relative problems in inflation model comparing to big bang.\\

1. The age of universe is shortered, but little, which means if inflation really happened the true age of our universe is shorter than we think in big bang model(experimentally measured by $H^{-1}$). \\

2. The presently connected region (or the particle horizon ,or the the presently observable universe) is larger ,more or less,deppending on the enlargement factor of $\frac{a(t_e)}{a(t_i)}$, than we think in big bang model.\\

3. The observed universe may intersect the particle horizon one, two or three times depending on $\frac{a(t_e)}{a(t_i)}$.\\ 


It is clear the particle horizon is larger than the observed universe(larger by about $6*10^{17}m$). The two curves intersect three times. Simple caculation give them$(t_1=2.2*10^{-83}s,t_2=3.06*10^4s,t_3=3.16*10^{17}s)$.  Just the same caculation gives $6*10^{24}m,t_1=2.2*10^{-97},t_2=1.25*10^{15},t_3=2.95*10^{17}$ in the situation of Guth and Steinhardt[3]($\frac{a(t_e)}{a(t_i)}=10^{50},t_i=10^{-34}s$), which is very different from their figure where no intersect is presented after inflation. Note that the first itersect point in both of them make no sense because of immerging into Planck epoch. Obviously if $\frac{a(t_e)}{a(t_i)}$ is large enough the situation of no intersect after inflation appears. The critical point is $Z_c=\frac{a(t_e)}{a(t_i)}=7.02*10^{50}.$ If the enlargement factor $Z<Z_c$ there exist bulks(parts of observed univese) exit and then reenter the particle horizon after inflation. But this is fundamentally defferent from reference[4]--there are no particle horizon exiting in inflation epoch in our scenario. So a matter bulk crossing apparent horizon(Hubble radius) during inflation does not mean its outer parts losing causal connection.    
  We can see this scheme for particle horizon problem depends on the physics before Planck time, which we are not sure. It has to suppose the equation $H_{ph}=2t$ from $t=0$. In some sense we do not know if we can say ""before"" when physics plunging into Planck time. The same problem exists in the analyses of big bang model without inflation. In next section we will give a new project to conquer the particle horizon problem. This project is independent of physics plunging into Planck time.  
  



\section{Solve the particle horizon problem}
   The particle horizon is relative to a particle(an observer). Holding this in mind tightly we solve the particle horizon problem only need an idea.\\ 
   In figure 2 A,B,C are three points and the circles around them denote the particle horizons separately at time $t=t_0$. Point 1 and 2 in the particle horizon of A, 2 and 3 in B, etc. We can choose an physical quantity, such as temperature $T$ to represent the thermal equlibrium. The early literature[4] has proofed the very early universe can reach thermal equilibrium in the particle horizon of a particle, such as A,B,C, which equal to say 

\begin{equation}
T_1=T_2, T_2=T_3,T_3=T_4.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow T_1=T_4,
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[totalheight=2in]{horizon.eps}
\caption{Particle horizons } 
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}


although the two points have no casual realtion. Processing this derivation again and again, we get the conclusion that all the universe despite whether there exists casual relation in it is in thermal equilibrium. 
The horizon of an abitray point encloses a neighbour of the point. A compact region of a spacetime manifold can be covered by limited such open sets(neighbours of spacetime points).   This proof seems reasonable. But if we check it enough cautiously we can find a flaw. The flaw is ""the circles around them denote the particle horizons separately at time $t=t_0$."" It is no problem we can set up local RW coordinates in a particle horizon because of the homogeneous of spacetime in a particle horizon. But generally speaking no such good coordinates exist on the manifold (We always consider physics after the universe can be regarded as a manifold). So we must show particle horizons of different points share the same simultaneous hypersurface. In figue 3, $l$ and $m$ are two world lines representing two particles in communal parts of two particle horizons, say, of A and B in figure 2. Supposing the two particle horizons have different simultaneous hypersurfaces $DE$ and $DF$ we will get contradictory result. We choose a physical quantity representing physical homogeneousness, for example, temperature $T$. Because of the thermal equilibrium in a particle horizon in the very early universe, we have

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[totalheight=3in]{hysur.eps}
\caption{Simutaneous hypersurfaces } 
\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
T_D=T_E,
T_D=T_F,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Rightarrow T_F=T_E,
\end{equation}
which contradicts to the fact that the universe is not static. So we conclude that the whole universe manifold share a communal slicing if we require the space is homogeneous in a particle horizon and the universe is not static, which gives the proof of Eq.(29) and Eq.(30) a sound base.\\


A puzzle may apear. We know no particle travel faster than light in vacuum. How do the causal discrete areas ""know"" temperature of each other? We give a naive analogy of this situation. A theatre has fifty rows. All of the rows are full except the first row. Now all the audience stand up and then sit down to the front row, which seems like the people in the last row reach to the first raw at once.
