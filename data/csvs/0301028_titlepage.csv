  {\bf Abstract} \\[1ex]
 \end{center}
 As was shown by Aharony, Hanany and Kol and independently by Sen, type IIB 
 string theory admits configurations where strings of different charges $(p_i, 
 q_i)$ form so-called string networks. We argue that these networks blow up into
 ``supersheets'': supersymmetric spinning cylindrical D3-branes carrying 
 electric and magnetic fluxes. These supersheets are three-dimensional 
 generalizations of the supertubes that were constructed by Mateos and Townsend.
 We calculate the mass of both systems for arbitrary values of the parameters 
 and find exact agreement.
