We analyse possible cosmological scenarios on a brane where the brane
acts as a dynamical boundary of various black holes with  anti-de 
Sitter or de Sitter asymptotics. In many cases, the brane is found to 
describe completely non-singular universe. In some cases, quantum gravity
era of 
the brane-universe can also be avoided by properly tuning bulk parameters.
We further discuss the creation of a brane-universe by studying its wave 
function. This is done by employing Wheeler-De Witt equation in the
mini superspace formalism.
