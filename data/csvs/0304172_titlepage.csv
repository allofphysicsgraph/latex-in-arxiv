\vspace{5 mm}

We study aspects of the accelerating cosmologies obtained from
the compactification of vacuum solution and S2-branes of superstring/M
theories. Parameter dependence of the resulting expansion of our universe
and internal space is examined for all cases.
We find that accelerated expansions are obtained also from spherical
internal spaces, albeit the solution enters into contracting phase eventually.
The relation between the models of SM2- and SD2-branes are also discussed,
and a potential problem with SD2-brane model is noted.
