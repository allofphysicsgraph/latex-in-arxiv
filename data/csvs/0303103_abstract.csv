  In the presence of a short-distance cutoff, the choice of a vacuum
  state in an inflating, non-de Sitter universe is unavoidably
  ambiguous.  The ambiguity is related to the time at which initial
  conditions for the mode functions are specified and to the way the
  expansion of the universe affects those initial conditions.  In this
  paper we study the imprint of these uncertainties on the predictions
  of inflation.  We parametrize the most general set of possible
  vacuum initial conditions by two phenomenological variables.  We
  find that the generated power spectrum receives oscillatory
  corrections whose amplitude is proportional to the Hubble parameter
  over the cutoff scale.  In order to further constrain the
  phenomenological parameters that characterize the vacuum definition,
  we study gravitational particle production during different
  cosmological epochs.
