We implement in systems of fermions the formalism of pseudoclassical 
paths that we recently developed for systems of bosons and show that 
quantum states of fermionic fields can be described, in the Heisenberg 
picture, as linear combinations of randomly distributed paths that do not 
interfere between themselves and obey classical Dirac equations. Every 
physical observable is assigned a time-dependent value on each path in a 
way that respects the anticommutative algebra between quantum operators 
and we observe that these values on paths do not necessarily satisfy the 
usual algebraic relations between classical observables. We use these 
pseudoclassical paths to define the dynamics of quantum fluctuations in 
systems of fermions and show that, as we found for systems of bosons, the 
dynamics of fluctuations of a wide class of observables that we call 
""collective"" observables can be approximately described in terms of 
classical stochastic concepts. Finally, we apply this formalism to 
describe the dynamics of local fluctuations of globally conserved fermion
numbers.
