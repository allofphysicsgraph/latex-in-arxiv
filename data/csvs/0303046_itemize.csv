\item {\it Hagedorn inflation}.  The transverse 
`bulk' components of the energy-momentum tensor can be negative. 
If all of the transverse dimensions have winding modes,
this negative `pressure' causes the brane to 
power law inflate along its length with 
a scale factor that varies as $a\sim t^{4/3}$
even in the absence of a nett cosmological constant 
(see eq.(\ref{61})).
If there are transverse dimensions that are large (in the sense that 
the string modes are not space-filling in these directions),
then we can find exponential inflation (see eq.(\ref{expinf})). 
{\it No potential is required here}. Merely the existence of open strings
on D-branes drives the inflation.
