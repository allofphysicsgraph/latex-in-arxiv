We consider four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge
theories with gauge group $U(N)$ on $R^3 \times S^1$, in the
presence of a classical superpotential. The low-energy quantum
superpotential is obtained by simply replacing the adjoint scalar
superfield in the classical superpotential by the Lax matrix of
the integrable system that underlies the 4d field theory. We
verify in a number of examples that the vacuum structure obtained
in this way matches precisely that in 4d, although the degrees of
freedom that appear are quite distinct. Several features of 4d
field theories, such as the possibility of lifting vacua from
$U(N)$ to $U(tN)$, become particularly simple in this framework.
It turns out that supersymmetric vacua give rise to a reduction of
the integrable system which contains information about the field
theory but also about the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model. The
relation between the matrix model and the quantum superpotential
on $R^3\times S^1$ appears to involve a novel kind of mirror
symmetry.
