  Solid lines lie on the sheet $u_0(z)$, while dashed lines lie on

  generated by a logarithmic term in the potential (viewed as cuts of
  the birationally transformed curve (\ref{polycurve})). The cut
  $-I_0$ corresponds to branching of $u_1$ with $u_2$, and
  consequently it is not shown.  The figure also indicates the new cycles
  $A_0$, ${\tilde A}_0^\pm$ on the Riemann surface.  Solid cycles lie
  on the sheet $u_0(z)$, while the dashed cycle lies on $u_1(z)$.  The curves
  $\gamma_0$,${\tilde \gamma}_0^\pm$ mentioned in the text 
  are the projections of $A_0$ and 
  ${\tilde A}_0^\pm$ onto the $z$-plane. }

\caption{Choice of B-cycles on the large $N$ Riemann surface.
  We only indicate a few cuts close to the point $\Lambda$.  The
  cycles ${\bar B}_i,{\bar {\tilde B}}_j$ and $B_d(\Lambda), {\tilde
    B}_\delta(\Lambda)$ are defined such that, when crossing a cut
  going upwards along these cycles, one moves from the branch $u_0$ to
  the branch $u_1$ (drawn dashed) or $u_2$ (dotted) respectively.
  With the orientation of the Riemann surface induced by its complex
  structure, and with the indexing $\alpha$ of cuts explained the
  text, this implies the intersections $A_\alpha \cap {\bar
    B}_\alpha=+1$ for the re-indexed cycles (note that the cycles
  $A_\alpha$ and ${\bar B}_\alpha$ intersect in a single point, which
  lies on the branch $u_0$).}
