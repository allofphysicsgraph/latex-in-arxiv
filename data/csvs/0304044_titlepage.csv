\begin{abstract}
In this paper we indulge in a general discussion of outstanding
conceptual issues in the operator/Moyal approach to open string
field theory, especially with regard to the role of singularities
encountered in this approach. We argue that the singularities are
not artifacts of the formalism, but persist in any basis and have
a concrete physical interpretation in terms of ambiguities in the
star algebra itself, i.e. associativity anomalies. We also study
the free string hamiltonian $L_0$ and explain why it must be
singular when formulated algebraically in terms of the star
product.
