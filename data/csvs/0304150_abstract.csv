We investigate the description of the region behind the event horizon
in rotating black holes in the AdS/CFT correspondence, using the
rotating BTZ black hole as a concrete example. We extend a technique
introduced by Kraus, Ooguri and Shenker~\cite{kos}, based on
analytically continuing amplitudes defined in a Euclidean space, to
include rotation. In the rotating case, boundary amplitudes again have
two different bulk descriptions, involving either integration only
over the regions outside the black holes' event horizon, or
integration over this region and the region between the event horizon
and the Cauchy horizon (inner horizon). We argue that generally, the
holographic map will relate the field theory to the region bounded by
the Cauchy horizons in spacetime. We also argue that these results
suggest that the holographic description of black holes will satisfy
strong cosmic censorship.
