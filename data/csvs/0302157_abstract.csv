We propose a new Doubly Special Relativity theory based on the
generalization of the $\kappa$-deformation of the Poincar\'e
algebra acting along one of the null directions. We recall the
full quantum algebra (Hopf) structure of such deformed Poincar\'e
algebra and use it to derive the  (deformed) phase space algebra.
As in the DSR based on the standard quantum $\kappa$-Poincar\'e
algebra we find that the space time is non-commutative. We
investigate the fate of the properties of Special Relativity in
the null basis: the split of the algebra of Lorentz and momentum
generators into kinematical and dynamical parts, the action of the
kinematical boost $M^{+-}$, and the emergence of the two
dimensional Galilean symmetry.
