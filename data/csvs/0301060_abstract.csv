We consider the two-dimensional model of $W_{3}$-gravity within Lagrangian
quantization methods for general gauge theories. We use the
Batalin--Vilkovisky formalism to study the arbitrariness in the realization
of the gauge algebra. We obtain a one-parametric non-analytic extension of
the gauge algebra, and a corresponding solution of the classical master
equation, related via an anticanonical transformation to a solution
corresponding to an analytic realization. We investigate the possibility of
closed solutions of the classical master equation in the Sp(2)-covariant
formalism and show that such solutions do not exist in the approximation up
to the third order in ghost and auxiliary fields.
