We study the quantisation of complex, finite--dimensional, compact, classical 
phase spaces ${\cal C}$, by explicitly constructing Hilbert--space vector bundles over 
${\cal C}$. We find that these vector bundles split as the direct sum of two holomorphic 
vector bundles: the holomorphic tangent bundle $T({\cal C})$, plus a complex line bundle 
$N({\cal C})$. Quantum states (except the vacuum) appear as tangent vectors to ${\cal C}$. 
The vacuum state appears as the fibrewise generator of $N({\cal C})$. 
Holomorphic line bundles $N({\cal C})$ are classified by the elements of ${\rm Pic}\,({\cal C})$, 
the Picard group of ${\cal C}$. In this way ${\rm Pic}\,({\cal C})$ appears as the parameter space 
for nonequivalent vacua. Our analysis is modelled on, but not limited to, the case when ${\cal C}$ 
is complex projective space ${\bf CP}^n$. 

Keywords: Quantum mechanics, projective spaces, holomorphic vector bundles.
