We study small fluctuations of the stringy wormhole solutions of
graviton-dilaton-axion system in arbitrary dimensions. We show
under O($d$)-symmetric harmonic perturbation that the Euclidean
wormhole solutions are unstable in flat space irrespective of
dimensions and in anti de Sitter space of $d=3$.
