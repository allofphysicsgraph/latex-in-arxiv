We discuss  the asymptotic properties of quantum sta\-tes density for
fundamental $p-$ branes which can yield a microscopic interpretation
of the thermodynamic quantities in M-theory. The matching of the BPS 
part of spectrum for superstring and supermembrane gives the possibility 
of getting membrane's results via string calculations. In the weak coupling 
limit of M-theory the critical behavior coincides with the first order phase 
transition in standard string theory at temperature less then the Hagedorn's 
temperature $T_H$. The critical temperature at large coupling constant is 
computed 
by considering M-theory on manifold with topology 
${\mathbb R}^9\otimes{\mathbb T}^2$. 
Alternatively we argue that any finite temperature can be introduced in the 
framework of 
membrane thermodynamics.
