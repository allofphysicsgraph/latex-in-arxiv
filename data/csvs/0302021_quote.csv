We construct 7-dimensional compact Einstein 
spaces with conical singularities that preserve 1/8
of the supersymmetries of M-theory. Mathematically they have 
weak $G_2$-holonomy. We show that for every non-compact 
$G_2$-holonomy manifold which is asymptotic to a cone on 
a 6-manifold $Y$, there is a corresponding weak 
$G_2$-manifold with two conical singularities which, close to 
the singularities, looks like a cone on $Y$. Our construction
provides explicit metrics on these weak $G_2$-manifolds.
We completely determine the cohomology of these manifolds
in terms of the cohomology of $Y$.
