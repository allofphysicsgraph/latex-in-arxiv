We give a simple interpretation of the recent solutions for cosmologies
with a transient accelerating phase obtained from compactification in
hyperbolic manifolds, or from S-brane solutions of string/M-theory. In
the four-dimensional picture, these solutions correspond to bouncing the
radion field off its exponential potential. Acceleration occurs at the
turning point, when the radion stops and the potential energy
momentarily dominates. The virtues and limitations of these approaches
become quite transparent in this interpretation.
