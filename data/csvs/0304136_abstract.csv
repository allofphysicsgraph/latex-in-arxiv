The properties of a non-canonical 3D Wigner quantum
oscillator, whose position and momentum operators generate
the Lie superalgebra $sl(1|3)$, are further investigated.
Within each
state space $W(p)$, $p=1,2,\ldots$, the energy $E_q$, $q=0,1,2,3$,
takes no more than 4 different values. If the oscillator is in a
stationary state $\psi_q\in W(p)$ then measurements of the
non-commuting Cartesian coordinates of the particle are such
that their allowed values are consistent with it being found
at a finite number of sites, called ``nests''. These lie on a
sphere centered on the origin of fixed, finite radius $\varrho_q$.
The nests themselves are at the vertices of a rectangular
parallelepiped.
In the typical cases ($p>2$) the number of nests is 8
for $q=0$ and $3$, and varies from 8 to 24, depending on the state,
for $q=1$ and $2$.
The number of nests is less in the atypical cases ($p=1,2$),
but it is never less than two. In certain states in $W(2)$
(resp. in $W(1)$) the oscillator is ``polarized'' so that all
the nests lie on
a plane (resp. on a line). The particle cannot be
localized in any one of the available nests alone since the
coordinates do not commute. The probabilities of measuring
particular values of the coordinates are discussed.
The mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the coordinates
and momenta are computed, and conclusions are drawn about
uncertainty relations.
