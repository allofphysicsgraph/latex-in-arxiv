\caption{The solid curve shows ${2\over \pi} m$, 
and the dotted curves represent
$F$ for $\mu=1$ and $\lambda=10^{-2.8-0.3N}$ where $N=1\sim 6$ from
the highest to the lowest one. The end points at small $m$ of the dotted curves
correspond to the values at $m=m_0$ for each $\lambda$.
We can see that $F$ approaches to
the RS limit as $\lambda\to 0$.}
