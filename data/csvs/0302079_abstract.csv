A new mneumonic devise is shown to emerge in connection with $O(7)$ numerical tensors exhibiting duality and reflecting the natural $7=(4+3)$ splitting of $7$-dimensional space. Then Desargues' and Pappus' theorems are shown to be connected  through a geometry that makes use of octonionic numbers exhibiting this duality. Construction of exceptional Hilbert spaces based on Jordan algebras and exceptional projective geometries is illustrated. A brief discussion of the Moufang plane and non-Desarguesian geometries is presented.
