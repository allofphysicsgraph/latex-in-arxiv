We obtain a general class of time-dependent, asymptotically de Sitter
backgrounds which solve the first order bosonic equations that
extremize the action for supergravity with gauged non-compact
$R$-symmetry. These backgrounds correspond only to neutral fields with
the correct sign of kinetic energy. Within $N$=2 five-dimensional
supergravity with vector-superfields we provide examples of
multi-centered charged black holes in asymptotic de Sitter space,
whose spatial part is given by a time-dependent hyper-K\""ahler
space. Reducing these backgrounds to four dimensions yields
asymptotically de Sitter multi-centered charged black hole backgrounds
and we show that they are related to an instanton configuration by
a massive T-duality over time.  Within $N$=2 gauged supergravity in four
(and five)-dimensions with hyper-multiplets there could also be
neutral cosmological backgrounds that are regular and correspond to
the different de Sitter spaces at early and late times.

\section{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Time-dependent backgrounds in fundamental theory are much less
understood than stationary solutions. In addition these solutions
are typically singular, leading cosmological singularities of the
big bang or big crunch type.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a large class of
cosmological solutions that have an interpretation of solutions of
gauged supergravity with non-compact $R$-symmetry gauged. In this
case the positive cosmological constant leads to asymptotically de
Sitter  space. The obtained class of solutions satisfies first
order bosonic equations that extremize the action, and can be in a
broader sense referred to as supersymmetric (see
\cite{120,510,660} and references \ therein).


Gauging of non-compact $R$-symmetry introduces an effective
imaginary gauge coupling via Wick rotation $g= i\lambda$, and thus
the covariant derivatives for charged fields are typically
complex. In order to have a real Lagrangian, one would have to
impose further Wick rotation for  the charged matter fields or the
gauge fields. In either case, this will change the sign of the
kinetic energy terms for  their respective fields, which in fact
is the case for the supergravity models based on supergroups that
include the de Sitter group \cite{690}.

In this paper we shall consider only the neutral backgrounds that have
the correct signs of the kinetic energy terms.  Nevertheless at the
quantum level one has to face the problem with the ghost-like
contribution from charged sectors.  We do not have much to say about
this problem, and focus only on the neutral, bosonic part, where the
classical backgrounds are turned on.

The time-dependent asymptotically de Sitter backgrounds of
supergravity theory with non-compact $R$-symmetry gauged inherit a
number of properties of the static, asymptotically flat BPS
solutions of ungauged supergravity: there exist multi-centered
solutions, and the flat transverse space can be replaced by a
general hyper-K\""ahler space.

In order to motive the basic set-up, we start with the static
asymptotically flat BPS solution of five- (or four-) dimensional
ungauged supergravity and then generate the corresponding cosmological
solution, that solves the same first order integrability conditions,
but now for (non-compact) gauged supergravity with the {\it positive
cosmological constant}.

As an illustration let us demonstrate the generating technique for
five-dimensional $N$=2 ungauged supergravity without couplings to
matter supermultiplets.  The static BPS black hole solution is given
