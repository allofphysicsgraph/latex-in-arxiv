\item Standard RQFT is trivially recovered in the $\theta\to 0$,
$B\to 0$, $\lambda\to 1$ limit. As in the standard case, the quantum 
theory is obtained from a classical Hamiltonian which is relativistic 
invariant [the apparent noninvariance of $\lambda\neq 1$ in 
Eq.~(\ref{H}) is fictitious; as we remarked before, it is a consequence of 
the choice of the scale for the fields in order to write the standard
commutation relations between fields and momenta Eqs.~(\ref{phipi})],
but now we follow a quantification procedure, given by the 
new commutation relations~(\ref{theta}) and~(\ref{B}), which 
explicitely violates Lorentz symmetry. This is what we understand by the
``quantum theory of a noncommutative field''.
\item The Hamiltonian density defined in Eq.~(\ref{H}) is made of fields 
which commute at different space points, and therefore satisfies
\begin{equation}
[\mathcal{H}(\xbf),\mathcal{H}(\xbf')]=0\quad \mathrm{for}\, \,
\xbf\neq\xbf'.
\label{density1}
\end{equation}
This property is essential in RQFT to guarantee that the $S$-matrix will
be Lorentz-invariant. More specifically, what is required in RQFT is that
\begin{equation}
[\mathcal{H}(x),\mathcal{H}(x')]=0\quad \mathrm{for}\, \,
(x-x')\geq 0,
\label{density2}
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to Eq.~(\ref{density1}) in a Lorentz-invariant theory.
The two conditions are not equivalent however when relativistic invariance 
is lost. In fact, in the quantum theory of the noncommutative field, 
the Hamiltonian density satisfies Eq.~(\ref{density1}) but not 
Eq.~(\ref{density2}). The preservation of the property~(\ref{density1}) is 
in any case welcome since it allows to speak consistently about the concept 
of a Hamiltonian density. Without this condition, the energy of a closed 
finite system could depend on the energy of another system very far away. 
Commutation relations more general than Eqs.~(\ref{theta}) and~(\ref{B}) 
would violate Eq.~(\ref{density1}).
\item Keeping the property~(\ref{density1}) requires the introduction of
two real fields as the only way to implement a noncommutativity in field space.
This leads to a theory with two types of particles which correspond to
the particle and the antiparticle in the $\theta, B\to 0, \lambda\to 1$ 
limit (conventional RQFT). 
Particle and antiparticle are no longer degenerated in this extension
of RQFT, and their energy is different from the standard expression 
$\sqrt{\pbf^2+m^2}$ by small corrections parametrized by $\theta$, $B$
and $\lambda$. The theory naturally incorporates in this way a 
matter-antimatter asymmetry.
\item We have a new, specific form of the dispersion relation, or relation
between energy and momentum of a particle, Eq.~(\ref{E12}),
which is no longer Lorentz-invariant, while the theory still preserves 
rotational symmetry. Relativistic invariance is therefore
an ingredient which is lost in this extension of RQFT. We will see in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:phen} that this symmetry is violated not only at high energies,
but, surprisingly enough, also at low energies, being still compatible with
phenomenological observations. Relativistic causality is also violated, as
we check later in this section. 
\item An essential property of RQFT, which in principle should hold in any
sensible physical theory, is the cluster decomposition principle: experiments
which are sufficiently separated in space should have unrelated results.
A general theorem states that the $S$-matrix satisfies this crucial requirement
if the Hamiltonian can be expressed as a sum of products of creation and 
annihilation operators, with suitable non-singular 
coefficients~\cite{weinberg}. This theorem garantees that the cluster property
still holds in the noncommutative extension of RQFT.
