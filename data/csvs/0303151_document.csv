\begin{abstract}
We present a novel derivation of the duality between the two-dimensional 
Euclidean black hole and supersymmetric Liouville theory. We 
realise these $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field 
theories on the worldvolume of domain walls in a $(2+1)$-dimensional 
gauge theory. We show that there exist two complementary descriptions 
of the domain wall dynamics, resulting in the two mirror conformal field theories. 
In particular, 
effects which are usually attributed to worldsheet instantons are captured by the 
classical scattering of domain walls.

\section{Introduction}

The two-dimensional black hole is a much studied object. It 
was originally introduced in the early '90s as a classical solution of 
two-dimensional string theory \cite{2dbh}. In its Lorentzian form,   
the metric has the structure of the Schwarzchild solution and displays an 
event horizon. In the dark days before D-branes, this background 
was studied as a toy model to explore stringy properties of black 
holes. In these enlightened modern times, attention has focused on the Euclidean 
incarnation  of 
the two-dimensional black hole which has the geometry of a semi-infinite cigar and 
is shown in Figure 1. Of 
particular interest are the various cameo roles that this background plays in 
ten-dimensional string theory:\ it appears as a Calabi-Yau manifold develops 
an isolated singularity \cite{cy};\  in the near-horizon limit of non-extremal 
NS5-branes \cite{ns5};\ and in the double-scaling limit of little string theory 
\cite{dsns5}. At the end of this paper we will extend this list by 
demonstrating how the black hole sigma model arises in the D2-D6 system of IIA 
string theory.

The black hole may be described as a 
$SL(2,{\bf R})/U(1)$ coset model at level $k$. The semi-infinite cigar of Figure 1 has a 
metric and dilaton given by
\be
ds_{BH}^2&=&k[d\rho^2+\tanh^2\rho\, d\theta^2] \label{2dbh} \\
\Phi&=&\Phi_0-2\log\cosh\rho
\nonumber\ee
The geometry is non-singular at the tip $\rho=0$ if the coordinate $\theta$ is 
taken to have periodicity $2\pi$. The non-vanishing 
curvature close to the tip is compensated by the dilaton profile $\Phi$ to 
ensure one-loop conformal invariance. In the asymptotic regime  
$\rho\rightarrow\infty$ the string becomes weakly coupled and propagates  
in a cylindrical geometry of radius $\sqrt{k}$. 
\para
For large $k$ the radius of the asymptotic circle is large and one 
may employ semi-classical techniques to study the $(1+1)$-dimensional 
conformal field theory. For small $k$ one should attempt to find a T-dual description.
It was conjectured by Fateev, Zamolodchikov 
and Zamolodchikov that this T-dual description is a Landau-Ginzburg model with a 
particular potential, known as the sine-Liouville theory \cite{fzz}. 
This duality was used in \cite{kkk} as the starting point in the construction 
of a matrix model for the black hole. 
\para
While much evidence for the duality exists \cite{fzz,kkk}, a proof 
is currently lacking. Progress can be made through the introduction of 
supersymmetry. A  Kazama-Suzuki supercoset construction results in a theory 
with the bosonic background described by equation (\ref{2dbh}) and 
${\cal N}=(2,2)$ superconformal symmetry. 
The duality conjecture now states that the 
superconformal theory with target space (\ref{2dbh}) is dual to 
super-Liouville theory \cite{dsns5} 
(see also \cite{others} for earlier discussions), 
\be
{\cal L}=\int d^4\theta\,\frac{1}{2k}|Y|^2+\frac{\mu}{2}\left(
\int d^2\theta\,e^{-Y}+{\rm h.c.}\right)
\label{lv}\ee
Here $Y$ is a chiral superfield whose imaginary component has period $2\pi$, 
and $\mu$ is a mass scale.  This action is also accompanied by a linear dilaton. 
The asymptotic regime of this theory ${\rm Re}(Y)\rightarrow\infty$ describes a 
cylinder of radius $1/\sqrt{k}$, as befits the T-dual of the black hole. However, 
the opposite regime ${\rm Re}(Y)<0$ is disfavoured in the Liouville theory by the 
exponential rising potential. This is qualitatively different from the 
cigar metric, where the corresponding regime $\rho<0$ is removed by the 
geometry.
\para
A proof of the equivalence between the theories described by (\ref{2dbh}) 
and (\ref{lv}) was given by Hori and Kapustin\footnote{Their proof follows 
closely the techniques of \cite{hv}  
prompting them to refer to this duality as ``mirror symmetry''. This, in turn, 
made the title of the current paper sadly unavoidable.} \cite{hk}. 
They realise the black hole background (\ref{2dbh}) as the infra-red fixed point 
of a gauged-linear sigma model. One advantage of this construction is that 
it introduces instantons into the picture in the guise of Nielsen-Olesen 
vortices. These appear despite the lack of two-cycles in the target space 
(a related discussion of this phenomenon in the presence of NS5-branes was 
given in \cite{tdualns5}). Hori 
and Kapustin show that the effect of these instantons is to generate the 
superpotential (\ref{lv}) upon applying T-duality\footnote{A second 
derivation of this duality was given in \cite{ahkt} by compactifying 
Chern-Simons mirror theories \cite{dt} from three dimensions. In this case  
the instanton effects in two-dimensions are related to one-loop effects in 
three-dimensions.}.
\para
In this paper we present another derivation of the duality, which has a 
very different flavour to previous proofs. Our hope is that these techniques 
may prove useful beyond the situation considered here.
\para
The starting point is a $(2+1)$-dimensional abelian-Higgs model, with a mass 
gap and several isolated vacua. Our interest will be focused on the system of 
$(1+1)$-dimensional domain walls which interpolate between these vacua.  
The basic idea is that there are two different descriptions of the dynamics of the  
domain walls. In the first description, one studies domain walls in the 
classical theory and subsequently quantises their zero modes. 
In the second description, one integrates out the heavy modes in three 
dimensions, and then examines the dynamics of classical domain walls in the 
effective theory. We shall see that these two 
descriptions are precisely the two mirror theories (\ref{2dbh}) and 
(\ref{lv}). 
\para
The results of this paper are somewhat reminiscent of ${\cal N}=4$ 
super-Yang-Mills theories in $d=(2+1)$ dimensions \cite{3d}. 
Recall that the instanton effects of three-dimensional gauge theories 
(which are monopole configurations) are captured by the classical dynamics of 
monopoles in a different gauge group\footnote{For a quantitative comparison of 
instanton computations vs. monopole scattering, see \cite{3dinst}}. 
In the present setting, 
we have instanton effects of a two-dimensional gauge theory (which are 
Nielsen-Olesen vortices) once again captured by the classical 
dynamics of solitons: in this case domain walls.
\para
The paper is organised as follows. In the following section we present a 
pair of domain walls which feel no static force. We show that the velocity 
dependent interactions between the walls are described by a non-linear 
sigma-model with target space (\ref{2dbh}). In Section 3 we study the same 
domain walls in an effective, low-energy three-dimensional theory. 
We find that the quantum effects induce a static force between the 
two domain walls which is described by 
the Liouville theory (\ref{lv}). In Section 4, we discuss several further aspects of 
this idea,  including a brane construction in the D2-D6 system of IIA string theory 
and the realisation of other toric sigma 
models --- such as the ${\bf CP}^n$ model --- on the worldvolume of domain walls.  

\section{The Black Hole from Domain Wall Dynamics}

Our starting point is a $d=(2+1)$ dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory with 
${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry (8 supercharges). For interesting domain wall 
dynamics, we need three or more isolated vacua, resulting in two or 
more domain walls. We choose the simplest case of three vacua, which 
requires three charged hypermultiplets. The bosonic 
part of the Lagrangian is given by
\be
{\cal L}&=&\frac{1}{4e^2}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+\frac{1}{2e^2}|\partial{\bphi}|^2
+\sum_{i=1}^3(|{\cal D}q_i|^2+|{\cal D}\tilde{q}_i|^2)
-\sum_{i=1}^3|{\bphi}-{\bf m}_i|^2(|q_i|^2+|\tilde{q}_i|^2)\nonumber\\
&& -\frac{e^2}{2}
|\sum_{i=1}^3\tilde{q}_iq_i|^2
-\frac{e^2}{2}(\sum_{i=1}^3|q_i|^2-|\tilde{q}_i|^2-\zeta)^2 
\label{lag}\ee
Here $\bphi$ is a triplet of neutral scalar fields which live in the vector 
multiplet. Each hypermultiplet contains two complex scalar fields, $q_i$ and 
$\tilde{q}^\dagger_i$, with charge $+1$ under the $U(1)$ gauge group. In 
three dimensions, each hypermultiplet is assigned a triplet of masses 
${\bf m}_i$.
\para
If the masses ${\bf m}_i$ are distinct, and the FI parameter is strictly
 positive  $\zeta>0$,  then the theory has three isolated, massive vacua, given by
\be
{\rm Vacuum\ }i:\ \ \ \bphi={\bf m}_i\ \ ,\ \ 
|q_j|^2=\zeta\,\delta_{ij}\ \ ,\ \ 
|\tilde{q}_j|^2=0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ i=1,2,3
\label{vac}\ee
Let us examine the vacuum physics. In each ground state, supersymmetry is unbroken and 
the theory is in a Higgs phase. Together with the broken $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, the 
theory also exhibits an unbroken $U(1)_F^2$ flavour symmetry, acting on the $q_i$ and 
$\tilde{q}_i^\dagger$. All three vacua have a mass gap, with the 
lightest excitations depending on the ratio 
$k\sim \zeta/\Delta{\bf m}_i$ where $\Delta {\bf m}_i$ are the mass splittings. 
In the limit $k\rightarrow \infty$, hypermultiplet modes become massless, reflected 
by the appearance of a Higgs branch. In contrast, as $k\rightarrow 0$, the 
vector multiplet becomes light and a Coulomb branch of vacua appears. 
The parameter $k$ will be defined more precisely below, and plays an important role in 
our story.
