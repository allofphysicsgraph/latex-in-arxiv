\section{Introduction}

Quantum Liouville theory is a crucial ingredient for a variety 
of models for low dimensional quantum gravity
and non-critical string theories. In the case of two dimensional 
quantum gravity or non-critical string theories this is a consequence 
of the Weyl-anomaly \cite{Pol}, which forces one to 
take into account the quantum dynamics of the conformal factor of the
two-dimensional metric. More recently it was proposed that 
Liouville theory also plays a crucial role for {\it three-dimensional} quantum
gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant in the sense of
representing a holographic dual for this theory, see e.g. \cite{Kr,KV}
and references therein.

For all these applications it is crucial that the quantum Liouville theory
has a geometric interpretation as describing the  quantization of spaces
of two-dimensional metrics. Such an interpretation is to be expected
due to the close connections between {\it classical} Liouville theory and 
the theory of Riemann surfaces. Having fixed a complex structure on the
Riemann surface one may represent the 
unique metric of negative constant curvature locally in the form 
$ds^2=e^{2\varphi}dzd\bar{z}$ where $\varphi$ must solve the
Liouville equation $\partial\bar{\partial}\varphi=\frac{1}{4}e^{2\varphi}$.
This relation between the Liouville equation and the uniformization 
problem leads to beautiful connections between classical Liouville theory
and the theory of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces \cite{ZT}.

One may therefore expect that quantum Liouville theory is related
to some sort of ``quantization'' of the moduli spaces of  
Riemann surfaces. A concrete proposal in this direction was made by
H. Verlinde in \cite{V}, where it was proposed that the space of 
conformal blocks of the Liouville theory with its mapping class 
group representation is isomorphic to the 
space of states obtained by quantizing the Teichm\""uller spaces of
Riemann surfaces \cite{Fo,Ka1,CF}. We believe that understanding
Verlinde's conjecture will serve as a useful starting point for
developing the geometrical interpretation of the quantized Liouville theory
in general. The aim of the present paper
will be to outline the definition of the objects that are
involved in Verlinde's conjecture and to describe some key steps
towards the proof of it.

\section{Teichm\""uller spaces} 

The Teichm\""uller spaces ${\mathcal T}(\Sigma)$ are the spaces
of deformations of the complex structures on Riemann surfaces $\Sigma$.
As there is a unique metric of constant curvature -1 associated to 
each complex structure one may identify the Teichm\""uller spaces
with the spaces of deformations of the metrics with constant curvature -1.
Coordinates for the Teichm\""uller spaces can therefore be obtained
by considering the geodesics that are
defined by the constant curvature metrics.

\subsection{Penner coordinates}

A particularly useful set of coordinates was introduced
by R. Penner in \cite{Pe}. They can be defined for Riemann surfaces 
that have at
least one puncture. One may assume having triangulated the surface 
by geodesics that start and end at the punctures. As an example we have 
drawn in Figure \ref{triang} a triangulation of
the once-punctured torus.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}\epsfxsize7cm
\epsfbox{triang2.eps}\hspace{1cm}
%\epsfxsize5cm\epsfbox{triang2.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Triangulation of the once-punctured torus.}\label{triang}
\end{figure}
The length of these
geodesics will be infinite. In order to regularize this divergence
one may introduce one horocycle around each puncture and measure 
only the length of the segment of a geodesic that lies between the 
horocycles. Assigning to an edge $e$ its regularized length $l_e$
gives coordinates for the so-called decorated Teichm\""uller spaces. 
These are fiber spaces over the
Teichm\""uller spaces which have fibers that parameterize the choices of the 
``cut-offs'' as introduced by the horocycles. 

A closely related set of coordinates for 
the Teichm\""uller spaces themselves was introduced by Fock in \cite{Fo}.
The coordinate $z_e$ associated to an edge $e$ of a triangulation
can be expressed in terms of the Penner-coordinates via
$z_e=l_a+l_c-l_b-l_d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ label the
other edges of the triangles that have $e$ in its boundary as indicated in
Figure \ref{rectlab}.

\end{picture}
\caption{The labeling of the edges}\label{rectlab}
\end{figure}

Instead of triangulations of the Riemann surfaces
it is often convenient to consider the corresponding {\it fat graphs}, which
are defined by putting a trivalent vertex into each triangle and by 
connecting these vertices such that the edges of the triangulation are 
in one-to-one correspondence to the edges of the fat-graph.
%\begin{figure}[b]
%\epsfxsize5cm
%\centerline{\epsfbox{pef.eps}}\label{pefock}
%\caption{Part of a triangulation and of the corresponding fat graph.}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Symplectic structure}

The Teichm\""uller spaces carry a natural symplectic form, called 
Weil-Petersson symplectic form \cite{IT}. We are therefore dealing with a 
family of phase-spaces, one for each topological type of
the Riemann surfaces. One of the crucial virtues of the 
Penner/Fock-coordinates is the fact that the Weil-Petersson symplectic
form has a particularly simple expression in these coordinates. 
The corresponding Poisson-brackets are in fact {\it constant} for
Fock's variables $z_e$,
\begin{equation}\label{poisson}
\{z_{e}^{},z_{e'}^{}\}=n_{e,e'}, \quad{\rm where}\quad
n_{e,e'}\in\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}.
\end{equation}
The value of $n_{e,e'}$ depends on how edges $e$ and $e'$ are imbedded
into a given fat graph. If $e$ and $e'$ don't have a common 
vertex at their ends, or if one of $e$, $e'$ starts and
ends at the same vertex then $n_{e,e'}=0$. In the case that 
$e$ and $e'$ meet at two vertices one has 
$n_{e,e'}=2$ (resp. $n_{e,e'}=-2$) 
if $e'$ is the first edge to the right\footnote{w.r.t.
to the orientation induced by the imbedding of the fat-graph 
into the surface} (resp. left) of $e$ at both
vertices, and $n_{e,e'}=0$ otherwise. 
In all the remaining cases $n_{e,e'}=1$ (resp. $n_{e,e'}=-1$) 
if $e'$ is the first edge to the right (resp. left) of $e$ at the common
vertex. 

If one considers a surface $\Sigma_g^s$ with genus $g$ and
$s$ boundary components
one will find $s$ central elements in the Poisson-algebra defined
by (\ref{poisson}). These central elements $c_k$, $k=1,\ldots, s$ 
are constructed as $c_k=\sum_{e\in E_k} z_e$,
where $E_k$ is the set of edges in the triangulation that emanates from the 
$k^{\rm th}$ boundary component. The value of $c_k$ 
gives the geodesic length of the $k^{\rm th}$ boundary component \cite{Fo}.

\subsection{Changing the triangulation}

Changing the triangulation amounts to a change of coordinates for 
the (decorated) Teichm\""uller spaces. Any two triangulations can be related
to each other by a sequence of the following elementary moves  called flips:\\

\put(200,20){\circle*{3}}
\put(90,17){$\longrightarrow$}
\end{picture}
\caption{The elementary move between two triangulations}\label{fliplab}
\end{figure}

\noindent The change of variables corresponding to the elementary move
of Figure \ref{fliplab} is easy to describe: 
\begin{equation}\label{flipfovarclass}\begin{aligned}
z_a'=& z_a-\phi(-z_e),\\
z_d'=& z_d+\phi(+z_e),
\end{aligned} 
\quad z_e'=-z_e,\quad\begin{aligned}
z_b'=& z_b+\phi(+z_e),\\
z_c'=& z_c-\phi(-z_e),
\end{aligned}\quad{\rm where}\;\;\phi(x)=\ln(e^x+1),
\end{equation}
and all other variables are left unchanged.
These transformations generate a groupoid, the Ptolemy groupoid
\cite{Pe}, that
may be abstractly characterized by generators and relations:
One has a generator $\omega_{ij}$ 
whenever the triangles labeled
by $i$ and $j$ have an edge in common. The relation that 
characterizes the Ptolemy groupoid is called the Pentagon relation.
It is graphically represented in Figure \ref{pentagon}.

\subsection{The representation of the mapping class group}

The mapping class group ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ consists of
diffeomorphisms of the Riemann surface $\Sigma$ which are
not isotopic to the identity. It is generated by the Dehn-twists, 
which act on an annulus $A$ in the way indicated in Figure 
\ref{dehn}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\epsfxsize7cm
\centerline{\epsfbox{dehn2.eps}}
\caption{Action of a Dehn-twist on an annulus.}\label{dehn}
\end{figure}

Elements ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ will map any
graph drawn on the surface $\Sigma$, in particular
any triangulation of $\Sigma$, into another one. Since any
two triangulations can be connected by a sequence of elementary moves
one may represent any element ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ by the 
corresponding sequence of flips. This means that the 
mapping class group ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ is a subgroup of 
the Ptolemy groupoid ${\rm Pt}(\Sigma)$.

It is extremely useful to think of
the algebraically complicated mapping class group ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ 
as being embedded into the Ptolemy groupoid.




\section{Quantization of Teichm\""uller spaces}

\subsection{Algebra of observables and Hilbert space}
The simplicity of the Poisson brackets (\ref{poisson}) makes part of the
quantization quite simple. To each edge $e$ of a triangulation 
of a Riemann surface $\Sigma_g^s$ associate a quantum operator 
${\mathsf z}_e$. The algebra of observables $g\mathcal A}"

\end{figure}

Instead of triangulations of the Riemann surfaces
it is often convenient to consider the corresponding {\it fat graphs}, which
are defined by putting a trivalent vertex into each triangle and by 
connecting these vertices such that the edges of the triangulation are 
in one-to-one correspondence to the edges of the fat-graph.

\subsection{Symplectic structure}

The Teichm\""uller spaces carry a natural symplectic form, called 
Weil-Petersson symplectic form \cite{IT}. We are therefore dealing with a 
family of phase-spaces, one for each topological type of
the Riemann surfaces. One of the crucial virtues of the 
Penner/Fock-coordinates is the fact that the Weil-Petersson symplectic
form has a particularly simple expression in these coordinates. 
The corresponding Poisson-brackets are in fact {\it constant} for
Fock's variables $z_e$,
\begin{equation}\label{poisson}
\{z_{e}^{},z_{e'}^{}\}=n_{e,e'}, \quad{\rm where}\quad
n_{e,e'}\in\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}.
\end{equation}
The value of $n_{e,e'}$ depends on how edges $e$ and $e'$ are imbedded
into a given fat graph. If $e$ and $e'$ don't have a common 
vertex at their ends, or if one of $e$, $e'$ starts and
ends at the same vertex then $n_{e,e'}=0$. In the case that 
$e$ and $e'$ meet at two vertices one has 
$n_{e,e'}=2$ (resp. $n_{e,e'}=-2$) 
if $e'$ is the first edge to the right\footnote{w.r.t.
to the orientation induced by the imbedding of the fat-graph 
into the surface} (resp. left) of $e$ at both
vertices, and $n_{e,e'}=0$ otherwise. 
In all the remaining cases $n_{e,e'}=1$ (resp. $n_{e,e'}=-1$) 
if $e'$ is the first edge to the right (resp. left) of $e$ at the common
vertex. 

If one considers a surface $\Sigma_g^s$ with genus $g$ and
$s$ boundary components
one will find $s$ central elements in the Poisson-algebra defined
by (\ref{poisson}). These central elements $c_k$, $k=1,\ldots, s$ 
are constructed as $c_k=\sum_{e\in E_k} z_e$,
where $E_k$ is the set of edges in the triangulation that emanates from the 
$k^{\rm th}$ boundary component. The value of $c_k$ 
gives the geodesic length of the $k^{\rm th}$ boundary component \cite{Fo}.

\subsection{Changing the triangulation}

Changing the triangulation amounts to a change of coordinates for 
the (decorated) Teichm\""uller spaces. Any two triangulations can be related
to each other by a sequence of the following elementary moves  called flips:\\

\caption{The elementary move between two triangulations}\label{fliplab}
\end{figure}

\noindent The change of variables corresponding to the elementary move
of Figure \ref{fliplab} is easy to describe: 
\begin{equation}\label{flipfovarclass}\begin{aligned}
z_a'=& z_a-\phi(-z_e),\\
z_d'=& z_d+\phi(+z_e),
\end{aligned} 
\quad z_e'=-z_e,\quad\begin{aligned}
z_b'=& z_b+\phi(+z_e),\\
z_c'=& z_c-\phi(-z_e),
\end{aligned}\quad{\rm where}\;\;\phi(x)=\ln(e^x+1),
\end{equation}
and all other variables are left unchanged.
These transformations generate a groupoid, the Ptolemy groupoid
\cite{Pe}, that
may be abstractly characterized by generators and relations:
One has a generator $\omega_{ij}$ 
whenever the triangles labeled
by $i$ and $j$ have an edge in common. The relation that 
characterizes the Ptolemy groupoid is called the Pentagon relation.
It is graphically represented in Figure \ref{pentagon}.

\subsection{The representation of the mapping class group}

The mapping class group ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ consists of
diffeomorphisms of the Riemann surface $\Sigma$ which are
not isotopic to the identity. It is generated by the Dehn-twists, 
which act on an annulus $A$ in the way indicated in Figure 
\ref{dehn}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\epsfxsize7cm
\centerline{\epsfbox{dehn2.eps}}
\caption{Action of a Dehn-twist on an annulus.}\label{dehn}
\end{figure}

Elements ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ will map any
graph drawn on the surface $\Sigma$, in particular
any triangulation of $\Sigma$, into another one. Since any
two triangulations can be connected by a sequence of elementary moves
one may represent any element ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ by the 
corresponding sequence of flips. This means that the 
mapping class group ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ is a subgroup of 
the Ptolemy groupoid ${\rm Pt}(\Sigma)$.

It is extremely useful to think of
the algebraically complicated mapping class group ${\rm MC}(\Sigma)$ 
as being embedded into the Ptolemy groupoid.




\section{Quantization of Teichm\""uller spaces}

\subsection{Algebra of observables and Hilbert space}
The simplicity of the Poisson brackets (\ref{poisson}) makes part of the
quantization quite simple. To each edge $e$ of a triangulation 
of a Riemann surface $\Sigma_g^s$ associate a quantum operator 
${\mathsf z}_e$. The algebra of observables $g\mathcal A}"
