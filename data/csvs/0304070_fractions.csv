 {\rho^2} \left( \partial_\chi^2 \phi - \cot{\chi} \partial_\chi \phi \right) = 0
\end{equation}
The solution can be separated, $\phi(\rho,\chi) = f(\rho) g(\chi)$ and
the resulting equations solved in terms of a separation constant $k$,
which we may chose to be positive. The radial equation is easily
solved giving,
\begin{equation}
f(\rho) = \rho^{\pm k - 1}
\label{eq:fsoln}
\end{equation}
and since we wish the back-reaction to be small, we may only take
solutions that are regular as $\rho \rightarrow 0$.

Now we consider the angular equation. The horizon, at $\chi = 0, \pi$,
must be an equipotential surface.  Due to the separable form, we see
this may either be achieved by $f$ being constant (ie. k = 1), or by
$g = 0$ at $\chi = 0, \pi$. The first case yields only the trivial
solution $\phi = const$.  The second is more subtle, and we find the
solution,
\begin{equation}
g(\chi) = \sin^2{\chi} \, F\left(\frac{3-k}{4}"
