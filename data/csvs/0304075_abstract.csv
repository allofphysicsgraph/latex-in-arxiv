We briefly introduce the conception on Euler-Lagrange cohomology
groups on a symplectic manifold $(\mathcal{M}^{2n}, \omega)$ and
systematically present the general form of volume-preserving
equations on the manifold from the cohomological point of view. It
is shown that for every volume-preserving flow generated by these
equations there is an important 2-form that plays the analog role
with the Hamiltonian in the Hamilton mechanics. In addition, the
ordinary canonical equations with Hamiltonian $H$ are included as
a special case with the 2-form $\frac{1}{n-1}\,H\,\omega$. It is
studied the other volume preserving systems on $({\cal M}^{2n},
\omega)$. It is also explored the relations between our approach
and Feng-Shang's volume-preserving systems as well as the Nambu
mechanics.
