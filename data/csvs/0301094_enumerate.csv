\item Witten's classical open string field theory should have a
  locally stable nontrivial vacuum solution.  The energy density of
  this vacuum should be given by  the D25-brane tension
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta E}{V}  =T_{25} = -\frac{1}{2 \pi^2 g^2} \,.

\end{equation}
\item Lower-dimensional D-branes should exist as solitonic solutions
  of SFT which break part of the Lorentz symmetry of the perturbative
  vacuum.
\item Open strings should decouple from the theory in the nontrivial
  vacuum, since the D25-brane is absent in this vacuum.

\item[1)] The first important unsolved problem in this area is to find
  an analytic description of the tachyonic vacuum.  Despite several
  years of work on this problem, great success with numerical
  approximations, and some insight from the RSZ vacuum string field
  theory model, we still have no good analytic understanding of the
  difference between the D-brane vacuum and the empty vacuum in
  Witten's open cubic string field theory.  It seems almost 
  unbelievable that there is not some elegant analytic solution to
  this problem.  Finding such an analytic
  solution would almost certainly greatly enhance our understanding of
  this theory, and would probably lead to other significant advances.
\item[2)] Another interesting and important unsolved problem is to
  find, either analytically or numerically, a solution of the Witten
  theory describing {\it two} D25-branes.  If open string field theory
  is truly a background-independent theory, at least in the open
  string sense, it should be just as feasible to go from a vacuum with
  one D-brane to a vacuum with two D-branes as it is to go from a
  vacuum with one D-brane to the empty vacuum (or from the vacuum with
  two D-branes to the vacuum with one D-brane, which is essentially
  the same problem as going from one to none).  Despite some work on
  this problem \cite{Ellwood-Taylor-2}, there is as yet no evidence
  that a double D-brane solution exists for the Witten theory on a
  single D-brane.  Several approaches which have been tried (and will
  be described in more detail in
  \cite{Ellwood-Taylor-2}) include: {\it i}) following a positive mass
  field upward, looking for a stable point; this method seems to fail
  because of gauge-fixing problems---the effective potential often develops
  a singularity before reaching the energy $+ T_{25}$, {\it ii})
  following the intuition of the RSZ model and constructing a gauge
  transform of the original D-brane solution which is
  $\star-$orthogonal to the original D-brane vacuum.  It can be shown
  formally that such a state, when added to the original D-brane
  vacuum gives a new solution with the correct energy for a double
  D-brane; unfortunately, however, we have been unable to identify
  such a state numerically in level truncation.

There are several other problems closely related to the double D-brane
  problem.  One related problem is the problem of studying a D0-brane
  lump solution from the tachyon field on a D1-brane wrapped on a
  small circle.  When the circle is sufficiently small, the mass of
  the D0-brane is larger than that of the wrapped D1-brane.  In this
  case, it seems much more difficult to construct the D0-brane lump
  solution than it is when the D0-brane has mass smaller than the
  D1-brane \cite{Moeller-Zwiebach}.  Another possibly related problem
  is the problem of translating a single D-brane of less than maximal
  dimension in a transverse direction.  It was shown by Sen and
  Zwiebach \cite{Sen-Zwiebach-translate} (in a T-dual picture) that
  after moving a D-brane a finite distance of order of the string
  length in a transverse direction, the level-truncated string field
  theory equations develop a singularity.  Thus, in level truncation
  it does not seem possible to move a D-brane a macroscopic distance
  in a transverse direction\footnote{although this can be done
  formally \cite{Kluson}, it is unclear how the formal solution
  relates to an explicit expression in the oscillator language}.  In
  this case, a toy model \cite{Zwiebach-toy} suggests that the problem
  is that the infinitesimal marginal parameter for the brane
  translation ceases to parameterize the marginal trajectory in field
  space after a finite distance, just as the coordinate $x$ ceases to
  parameterize the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ near $x = 1$.  This is
  similar in spirit to the breakdown of Feynman-Siegel gauge along the
  tachyon potential discussed in section 6.1.

  To show that open string field theory is sufficiently general to
  address arbitrary questions involving different vacua, it is clearly
  necessary to show that the formalism is powerful enough to describe
  multiple brane vacua, the D0-brane lump on an arbitrary radius
  circle, and translated brane vacua.  It is currently unclear whether
  the obstacles to finding these vacua are conceptual or technical.
  It may be that the level-truncation approach is not well-suited to
  finding these vacua.  If this is true, however, we may need a
  clearer mathematical formalism for describing the theory.  There is
  currently some ambiguity in the definition of the theory, in terms
  of precisely which states are allowed in the string field.
  Level-truncation in some sense gives a regularization of, and a
  concrete definition to, the theory.  Without level truncation, we
  would need some more definitive mathematical tools for analyzing
  various features of the theory, such as the other vacua mentioned
  here.
\item[3)] Another open question involves the role that closed strings
  play in open string field theory.  As has been known since the
  earliest days of the subject, closed strings appear as poles in
  perturbative open string scattering amplitudes.  This was shown
  explicitly for Witten's SFT in \cite{fgst}, where it was shown that
  closed string poles arise in the one-loop 2-point function.  If
  Witten's theory is well-defined as a quantum theory, it would follow
  from unitarity that the closed string states should also arise in
  some natural sense as asymptotic states of the quantum open string
  field theory.  It is currently rather unclear, however, whether, and
  if so how, this might be realized.  There are subtleties in the
  quantum formulation of the theory which have never completely been
  resolved \cite{Thorn}.  Both older SFT literature
  \cite{Strominger-closed,Shapiro-Thorn} and recent work
  \cite{Gerasimov-Shatashvili,Moore-Taylor,RSZ-closed,Hashimoto-Itzhaki,
  a-Garousi} have
  suggested ways in which closed strings might be incorporated into
  the open string field theory formalism, but a definitive resolution
  of this question is still not available.  If it is indeed possible
  to encode closed string degrees of freedom in some way in the
  quantum open string field theory, it suggests that one could use the
  Witten formalism in principle to not only compute general closed
  string scattering amplitudes, but perhaps even to address questions
  of closed string vacua.  This is clearly an optimistic scenario, but
  one can imagine that the open string theory might really contain all
  of closed string physics as well as open string physics.  This
  scenario is perhaps not so farfetched, as it really represents
  simply a lifting to the level of string field theory of the AdS/CFT
  story, where the massive as well as the massless modes are included.
  Furthermore, the fact that, as discussed in Section 5.5, the open
  string diagrams precisely cover the moduli space of Riemann surfaces
  with an arbitrary number of handles (and at least one boundary),
  suggests that by shrinking the boundaries to closed strings, one
  might neatly describe all perturbative closed string amplitudes in
  the open string language.  On the other hand, it seems quite
  possible that the closed string sector of the theory is encoded in
  a singular fashion (like the encoding of the D-brane in the RSZ
  VSFT model), so that extracting the closed string physics from the open
  string field theory may involve such complicated manipulations that
  one is better off directly working with a closed string formalism.
  It would certainly be nice to have a clearer picture of how far one
  can go in this direction purely from the open string point of view.
\item[4)] Another obvious, but crucial, question is how this whole
  story can be generalized to superstrings.  The naive Witten cubic
  superstring field theory has technical problems arising from contact
  terms between picture-changing operators
  \cite{Wendt,Greensite-Klinkhamer}.  It has been suggested that these
  problems can be resolved directly in the cubic theory
  \cite{Aref'eva}.  Berkovits has also suggested a new non-polynomial
  string field theory framework which seems to deal successfully with
  the contact term problem, at least in the NS-NS sector
  \cite{Berkovits}.  Some preliminary work indicates that numerical
  calculations on the tachyon condensation problem for the open
  superstring can be carried out in the Berkovits model with analogous
  results to those described here for the bosonic open string,
  although the results to date for the superstring are much more
  limited \cite{superstring}.  It would be nice to have a more
  complete picture for the superstring, and some sense of how issues
  like the closed string question would work in the supersymmetric
  framework.
\item[5)] Perhaps the most important lesson we have learned from the
  body of work discussed in these lectures is that open string field
  theory is a consistent framework in which geometrically distinct
  open string backgrounds can arise as classical solutions of a single
  theory.  A fundamental outstanding problem in string theory is to
  find a framework in which different closed string backgrounds arise
  in a similar fashion from some fixed set of degrees of freedom
  within a single well-defined theory.  In principle, we would hope
  that all the different closed string backgrounds would arise as
  solutions of the equations of motion for the fundamental underlying
  degrees of freedom of string field theory, either by incorporating
  closed strings into the open string field theory framework as
  described above, or by working directly in some formulation of
  closed string field theory.  It is quite challenging to imagine a
  single set of degrees of freedom which would encode, in different
  phases, all the possible string backgrounds we are familiar with.  A
  particularly pressing case is that of M-theory.  In principle, a
  nonperturbative background-independent formulation of type II string
  theory should allow one to take the string coupling to infinity in
  such a way that the fundamental degrees of freedom of the theory are
  still actually at some finite point in their configuration space in
  the limit.  This would lead to the vacuum associated with M-theory
  in flat space-time.  It would be quite remarkable if this can be
  achieved in the framework of string field theory.  Given the
  nontrivial relationship between string fields and low-energy
  effective degrees of freedom, however, such a result cannot be ruled
  out.  If this picture could be successfully implemented, it would
  give a very satisfying understanding of how the complicated network
  of dualities of string and M-theory could be represented in terms of
  a single underlying set of degrees of freedom.
