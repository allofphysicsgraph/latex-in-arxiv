\item Why is the vacuum energy so small at the microscopic scales,
$M > M_w \sim 100 \, \hbox{GeV}$, at which the fundamental theory
is couched?
%
\item Why does it remain small as all the scales
between $M$ and $v$ are integrated out?

\item
Four dimensional spacetime is flat;
%
\item
The magnetic flux of the electromagnetic field through the sphere
is given -- with an appropriate normalization for $Q$ -- by $f =
{n /( 2 \, g_1 \, {r}^2)}$, where ${r}$ is the radius of the
sphere, $g_1$ is the $U(1)$ gauge coupling which appears in the
scalar potential when we use $v(0) = 2 \, g_1^2$, and the monopole
number is $n = \pm 1$;
%
\item
The sphere's radius is related to ${\varphi}$ by $ e^{\varphi} \,
{r}^2 = {1 /( 4 g_1^2)}$. Otherwise $\varphi$ and $r$ are
unconstrained.
