\section{Cheshire current and confinement}

In this appendix we will discuss the notion of a (magnetic) cheshire
current in AED and the confinement of charges in (2+1)-dimensional
(alice) electrodynamics \cite{Polyakov2}. We'll introduce a
configuration in AED named (magnetic) cheshire current and explain its
relation with (electrical) cheshire charges and confinement in two
dimensions. We'll introduce a picture of two dimensional confinement
from which qualitatively the confinement of the electrical flux into a
flux tube comes apparent.

\subsection{The cheshire current}
\label{Chescurrent}\label{nlcurrent}
Neither electric nor magnetic field lines are allowed to cross an alice
flux, suggesting some exotic type of super conductivity through the
core of the flux tube. In this part of the appendix we return to this
analogy and find an interesting gauge complementarity between electric
cheshire charges and a magnetic cheshire currents. Let us introduce
the latter first.\\[2mm] Let us consider the following ``gedanken''
experiment. We create two charged particles from the vacuum and take
one of the two particles around two spatially separated fluxes and
then annihilate the two particles again. If the flux tubes are
magnetic super-conductors this would have resulted in two magnetic
current carrying fluxes, each with closed electric field lines around
them. In the case of two alice fluxes a different picture
emerges. Since the field lines cannot close around a single alice flux,
one needs to take an even number of fluxes to be able to annihilate
the particles again. This means that if one pulls the two fluxes apart
one cannot be left with two fluxes which each carry a current. The
field lines need to stay around both fluxes. A situation very different
from the super conductors indeed.  The system as a whole carries the
current and just as in the case of a cheshire charge the current is
non-localizeable; we should call this object a cheshire current.

The resulting field line configuration, depicted in figure
\ref{current3.eps}, implies an attractive interaction between the two
fluxes, on top of the normal flux interactions. It has the opposite
effect of a cheshire charge, which leads to a repulsive force between
the two fluxes.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}\mbox{\psfig{figure=current3.eps,width=13cm}}
\caption[somethingelse]{\footnotesize Closed electric field lines of a
(magnetic) cheshire current configuration.}
\label{current3.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Upon closer inspection we will see that there is a certain {\em gauge
complementarity}, reconciling the two different pictures, describing
non-localizeable alice effects. At first sight electric cheshire
charge and a magnetic cheshire current appear to be very different
entities. Let us now point out that there is actually a close relation
between them. Imagine we repeat the gedanken experiment we just
performed, but now we move in two more alice fluxes from infinity in
such a way that all four of them are on one single line. As we know,
on each flux one $\mathbb{Z}_2$ line should end. For convenience we put these
half lines on top of the line on which we put the fluxes. For every
flux we then still have the freedom to let the line go to the left or
to the right.  The result just yields two different, but gauge
equivalent, configurations, as is illustrated by the top and bottom
pictures in figure \ref{confinement.eps}.

\noindent As we argued before, one can deform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lines in any
way one wants by gauge transformations. From figure
\ref{confinement.eps} it is clear that we can gauge transform the
first configuration into the last one. This means that they both
describe the same physics, although their interpretation appears to be
quite different. In one case, see the bottom picture of figure
\ref{confinement.eps}, one would argue that two cheshire charges are
the source of the field lines, but in the other situation, see the top
picture of figure \ref{confinement.eps}, one would argue that three
cheshire currents are the source of the field lines. Apparently there
are two different ways of looking at this configuration. As was
explained before \cite{schwarz} one needs to cut away some region(s)
of space-time if one wants to consider field strengths which are not
single valued in the presence of an alice flux. However, there is of
course not unique choice to do this. This freedom of choice
corresponds exactly to the gauge complementarity of cheshire charge
and cheshire current.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\begin{center}
\mbox{\psfig{figure=confinement.eps,width=11cm}}
\caption[somethingelse]{\footnotesize The 'duality' transformation
from three magnetic cheshire currents into two electric cheshire
charges. }
\label{confinement.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We do note that although they are related by a gauge
transformations it does not mean that all configurations can be
thought of as consisting only of cheshire charges or only of cheshire
currents. A simple example is a pair of alice fluxes carrying a
cheshire charge and a cheshire current. This object may in fact be a
stable configuration in two dimensions, since the electric cheshire
charge results in a repulsive force between the two fluxes whereas the
magnetic cheshire current results in a attractive force between the
two fluxes. These could be made to cancel leading to a stationary
configuration.


\subsection{Confinement in a two dimensional picture}

In this subsection we will consider the confinement of
(2+1)-dimensional electrodynamics. This problem was already solved in
\cite{Polyakov2}. For any non-zero value of the gauge coupling
constant (2+1)-dimensional electrodynamics is confining (in the
quenched approximation). It is well known that the instanton density
increases and polarizes around the minimal sheet bounded by a closed
Wilson loop. In a three dimensional Euclidean space the instanton
configuration is in fact just a magnetic monopole. After translating
the instanton configuration to Minkovski space it is easy to
understand that the polarization of the instanton density results in
the confinement of the electrical flux into a flux tube.\\ By going to
Minkovski space the interpretation of the fields change. The
$z$-component of the magnetic field becomes the pseudo scalar magnetic
field in the (2+1)-dimensional Minkovski space, while the $\theta$ and
$\rho$ components of the magnetic field get translated into the $\rho$
and $\theta$ components of the electric field respectively. For the
moment we will ignore the factors of $i$ as they will have no
influence on the picture we use, although they do play an important
role in the dynamics and the polarization of the instanton density.\\
Changing from Euclidean to Minkovski space allows us to interpreted
the instanton density as a magnetic current density in Minkovski
space. The nice thing of this two dimensional interpretation is that
the confinement of the electrical flux into a flux tube easily follows
from the superposition of the field lines of the pair of charges and
the magnetic currents. In figure \ref{confine.eps} we see that
superimposing a magnetic current to the electric dipole configuration
moves the field lines inwards. Indicating that a (polarized) magnetic
current density would confine the electric flux into a flux tube.

field configuration of two opposite charges in the absence of
instantons. In figure (b) we see that the introduction of magnetic
currents, representing the instantons in Minkovski space, pushes the
field lines inwards explaining the fact that the electric flux gets
confined in a flux tube in the presence of a (polarized) instanton
density.}

In the previous section of this appendix we introduced an object in
AED which can also be identified as a magnetic (cheshire)
current. However the dynamics, due to the factors of $i$, is very
different.
