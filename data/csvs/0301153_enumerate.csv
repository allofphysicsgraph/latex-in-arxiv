\item $\Pi_3^+$ defined by eq.\ (\ref{Homo1}).
\item $\Pi_3^0$ defined by eq.\ (\ref{Homo0}).
\item $\Pi_3^-$ defined by the equation
\begin{equation}  \label{Homo2}
\pi_i \pi^i = -1.

\item $\Pi_{3,+}^-$ obtained from the space $\Pi_3^-$ by identifying opposite points $\pm \pi^i$. One can also impose the condition $\pi^0 \geq 0$ and identify only  the points $(0, \pm \vec \pi)$.
\item $\Pi_{3,k}^0$ ($k > 1$) obtained from the space $\Pi_3^0$ by identifying points of the kind $k^m \pi^i$, where $m$ is an arbitrary integer.  One can also impose the condition $1 \leq \pi^0 \leq k$ and identify only the points $(1, \vec \pi)$ and $(k, k \vec \pi)$.

\item The cosmic rays do not come from the far intergalactic space.
\item The relativity principle is valid and the energy defined by eq.\ (\ref{Mom}) is subject to the GZK cutoff, but it is not the energy evaluated in the experiments. This may happen because the collisions of the cosmic rays with the nuclei in the high atmosphere, which have a center-of-mass energy much larger than the collisions studied in the terrestrial laboratories, have unexpected features, possibly a breakdown of the conservation laws.
\item  The relativity principle is not valid and there are privileged inertial frames. The fundamental laws may still be Lorentz covariant, but some long-range vector or tensor field may have a non vanishing expectation value that singles out the privileged frames.
