We develop Bohmian interpretations for noncommutative quantum field theory
and quantum mechanics. The conditions for the classical and commutative
limits for both theories are derived and applied for a\ formal discussion of
the quantum/classical and noncommutative/commutative passages. Classical
field theory and Newtonian mechanics are obtained as limit cases of
noncommutative quantum field theory and noncommutative quantum mechanics.
Some advantages of the Bohmian interpretation against the orthodox one are
underlined. An application of the theory for the noncommutative harmonic
oscillator is presented and worked\ out\ in detail. \vspace{5cm}
