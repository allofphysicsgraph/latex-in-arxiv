After a short presentation of KMS states and modular theory as the unifying
description of thermalizing systems we propose the absence of transverse
vacuum fluctuations in the holographic projections as the principle reason for
an area behavior (the transverse area) of \textit{localization entropy} as
opposed to the volume dependence of ordinary heat bath entropy. Thermalization
through causal localization is not a property of QM but results from the
omnipresent vacuum polarization in QFT and does not require a Gibbs type
ensemble avaraging (coupling to a heat bath).
