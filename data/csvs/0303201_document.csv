We give a direct {\sc Lie} algebraic characterisation of conformal
inclusions of chiral current algebras associated with compact,
reductive {\sc Lie} algebras. We use straightforward quantum field
theoretic arguments and prove a long standing conjecture of
Schellekens and Warner on grounds of unitarity and positivity
of energy. We explore the structures found to characterise
``conformal covariance subalgebras'' and ``coset current
algebras''.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Conformal inclusions of chiral current algebras are of interest for a
large variety of reasons. Their classification was undertaken some time
ago, because they are particularly relevant to string theory for them
making string compactification possible without altering 
conformal covariance. Using general
arguments this task was transfered to checking maximal inclusions of reductive
{\sc Lie} algebras in simple {\sc Lie} algebras, for which a
classification was available already. The classification of conformal
inclusion was thus achieved, looking at the central charge of the
respective stress energy tensors, by several authors \cite{AGO87,
  BB87, SW86}.

Many of the conformal inclusions were found to correspond to
``symmetric spaces'' (cf.\ \cite{GNO85, cD96} in particular) and
``isotropy irreducibility'' of the coset space proved a useful yet
neither necessary nor 
sufficient criterion for an inclusion being conformal. We undertake a complete
characterisation of conformal inclusions by means of straightforward
arguments familiar in (axiomatic) quantum field theory. On the course
we prove a longstanding\footnote{To the author's surprise, there
  does not seem to be a proof available yet.}
conjecture of {\sc Schellekens and Warner} 
\cite{SW86}. 

Our analysis applies directly and rigorously to all current
algebras which are available as quark models (cf.\ eg.\ \cite{GO86}%;either as unitary or as orthogonal quark models 
), because these manifestly fulfill {\sc Wightman}'s axioms for
quantum field theories and thus have all properties needed for
our argument: positivity of energy, unitarity, separating property of
the vacuum for local current fields ({\sc Reeh-Schlieder} property), common,
invariant domain. 
Quark models are available for current algebras
corresponding to the classical 
{\sc Lie} algebras  (type $A_n$, 
$B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$) and to the exceptional {\sc Lie} algebra $G_2$
at any level $k\in{\mathbb N}$ and for the types $E_{6-8}$, $F_4$ for
different infinite sets of levels. 
 We believe our results to hold true for the cases $E_6$, $E_7$,
 $E_8$, $F_4$ at
 all levels as well, but  {\sc Wightman}'s axioms appear only
 implicitly in the literature for these cases (see \cite{vKbook}
 (chapter 11), \cite{GW84}).


% The last four types of models are
% available at arbitrary level through a vertex operator 
% construction at level one\footnote{After embedding $F_4$ into $E_6$ with
%   \Name{Dynkin}-Index $1$ one may apply this construction to $F_4$ as
%   well.}, the ``basic construction'' of \Name{Frenkel and Kac} 
% \cite{FK80}, followed by projecting out the level $k$ vacuum
% representation from the $k$-fold tensor product of the level $1$
% vacuum representation. We believe our results to hold true for these
% as well, but the  arguments given here do not extend 
% directly% (cf.\ \cite{vL97})
% . 

Our analysis is of interest as it clarifies the situation in natural
group theoretical terms and in direct correspondence to quantum field
theoretical notions. In addition, there is no need to specialise in
maximal subalgebras and our approach is rather direct in that respect.

The author stumbled across the questions which are dealt with in this work
while investigating a related problem. This was about the question how
the inner-implementing represention $U^{\mathcal A}$, uniquely associated with every
covariant subtheory ${\mathcal A}$ of a chiral conformal theory
${\mathcal B}$ by means of the {\sc Borchers-Sugawara} construction
\cite{sK02}, acts on the observables of the larger theory
${\mathcal B}$. This illustrates why the point of view taken in this
article came to mind. An answer to the more general question is given
in an independent work \cite{sK03c}.      

We proceed as follows: In the next section we introduce notations
and conventions, prove the conjecture of {\sc Schellekens and Warner}
and provide a natural argument for conformal inclusions being
necessarily restricted to level $1$. The third section is about
studying ``conformal covariance subalgebras'' associated to
{\sc Lie} algebra inclusions, these being intermediate to the
original inclusion, if not trivial. The section will be closed by a
simple characterisation of ``coset currents'', i.e. current
subalgebras commuting with  the given current subalgebra.

\section{Characterisation of conformal inclusions}
\label{sec:char}

We study a current algebra associated with a simple\footnote{General reasoning leads to an extension of the following
discussion to 
inclusions of reductive subalgebras in reductive {\sc Lie}
algebras, cf.\ eg.\ \cite{AGO87}.}, compact {\sc Lie}
algebra ${\mathfrak g}$ by a quark model construction yielding symmetric operator
valued distributions, the currents. We will treat these as fields on
the chiral light ray. Basis elements of ${\mathfrak g}$ will
be denoted by $T^a$; they give the ``colour'' of the corresponding
current $j^a$. The current algebra is given by the following
commutation relations: 
\begin{displaymath}
  {\left[ j^a(x) , j^b(y) \right]} = i f^{ab}{}_c j^c(x) \delta(x-y) + k
  g^{ab}_{\mathfrak g} \frac{i}{2\pi} \delta' (x-y)
\end{displaymath}
$g_{\mathfrak g}$ denotes the {\sc Killing} metric of ${\mathfrak g}$,
$f^{ab}{}_c$ its structure constants and $k$ the current algebra's
``level''; $k$ is a positive integer.

By embedding a reductive {\sc Lie} subalgebra ${\mathfrak h}$ into
${\mathfrak g}$ via an injective homomorphism $\iota: {\mathfrak h}
\hookrightarrow {\mathfrak g}$ we have an associated current
subalgebra. ${\mathfrak h}$ consists of 
several simple ideals, denoted (for the time being) by
${\mathfrak h}_\alpha$, and an abelian 
ideal of dimension $n\geq 0$. The inclusions $\iota({\mathfrak h}_\alpha)
\subset {\mathfrak g}$ are partly characterised by their
{\sc Dynkin} index $I_\alpha$. Denoting the {\sc Killing} metric of
${\mathfrak h}_\alpha$ by $g_\alpha$ we have the following commutation
relations for currents associated with colours in $\iota({\mathfrak h}_\alpha)$:
