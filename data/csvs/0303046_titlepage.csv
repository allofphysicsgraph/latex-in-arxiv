{\bf Abstract} \bigskip \end{center} \setcounter{page}{0}
We demonstrate an inflationary solution to the cosmological horizon
problem during the Hagedorn regime in the
early universe.  Here the observable universe is confined to three
spatial dimensions (a three-brane) embedded in higher dimensions.
The only ingredients required are open strings on
D-branes at temperatures close to the string scale.
No potential is required.
Winding modes of the strings
provide a negative pressure that can drive inflation of our
observable universe.  Hence the mere existence of open strings on branes
in the early hot phase of the universe drives Hagedorn inflation,
which can be either power law or exponential. 
We note the amusing fact that, in the case of  stationary
extra dimensions, inflationary expansion takes place only for branes
of three or less dimensions.
