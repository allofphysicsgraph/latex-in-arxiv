We compute
the corrections to
heterotic-string backgrounds with (2,0) world-sheet
supersymmetry, up to two loops in
sigma-model perturbation theory. We investigate
the conditions for these backgrounds to preserve
spacetime supersymmetry and we find that a sufficient requirement
for consistency is
 the applicability
of the $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. In particular, we
investigate the $\alpha'$ corrections to (2,0) heterotic-string
compactifications and we find that the Calabi-Yau geometry of the
internal space is deformed to a Hermitian one. We show that at
first order in $\alpha'$, the heterotic anomaly-cancellation mechanism
does not induce any lifting of  moduli. We explicitly compute the
corrections to the conifold and 
to the $U(n)$-invariant Calabi-Yau metric at
first order in $\alpha'$. We also find a generalization  of the 
gauge-field equations, compatible with the Donaldson equations on
 conformally-balanced Hermitian manifolds.
