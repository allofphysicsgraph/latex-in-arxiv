\caption{Energy levels of the Hamiltonian $H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\epsilon$
as a function of the parameter $\epsilon$. There are three
regions: When $\epsilon\geq0$, the spectrum is real and positive
and the energy levels rise with increasing $\epsilon$. The lower
bound of this region, $\epsilon=0$, corresponds to the harmonic
oscillator, whose energy levels are $E_n=2n+1$. When
$-1<\epsilon<0$, there are a finite number of real positive
eigenvalues and an infinite number of complex conjugate pairs of
eigenvalues. As $\epsilon$ decreases from $0$ to $-1$, the number
of real eigenvalues decreases; when $\epsilon\leq-0.57793$, the
only real eigenvalue is the ground-state energy. As $\epsilon$
approaches $-1^+$, the ground-state energy diverges. For $\epsilon
\leq-1$ there are no real eigenvalues.} \label{f1}
