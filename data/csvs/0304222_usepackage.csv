\begin{abstract}
Nonperturbative treatments of the UV limit of pure gravity
suggest that it admits a stable fixed point with positive
Newton's constant and cosmological constant.
We prove that this result is stable under the addition of 
a scalar field with a generic potential
and nonminimal couplings to the scalar curvature.
There is a fixed point where the mass 
and all nonminimal scalar interactions vanish while 
the gravitational couplings have values which are almost 
identical to the pure gravity case.
We discuss the linearized flow around this fixed point
and find that the critical surface is four-dimensional.
In the presence of other, arbitrary, massless minimally 
coupled matter fields, the existence of the fixed point,
the sign of the cosmological constant and the dimension of the
critical surface depend on the type and number of fields. 
In particular, for some matter content,
there exist polynomial asymptotically
free scalar potentials, thus providing a 
solution to the well-known problem of triviality.

\section{Introduction}

The failure of perturbative approaches to quantum gravity does not
necessarily imply that quantum gravity does not exist as a field
theory. There is still in principle the possibility that the theory
could be ``nonperturbatively quantized''.
To understand what this means, one has to look at the
Renormalization Group (RG), \emph{i.\ e.}\ the flow of the coupling
constants $\tilde g_i(k)$ as a certain external momentum parameter $k$ is changed%
\footnote{the precise physical meaning of the parameter $k$ depends
on the specific problem that one is addressing; it is usually
the momentum of some particle entering into the process under
study, or the inverse of some characteristic lenght of the system.
In general, $k$ has the meaning of an IR cutoff, because the
effective theory describing the process must include the effect of
all the fluctuations of the fields with momenta larger than $k$.}.
It is customary to take $k$ as unit of mass; if $\tilde g_i$ has
dimension $d_i$ in units of mass, we define
dimensionless couplings $g_i=\tilde g_i k^{-d_i}$.
The RG flow is then given by the integral curves of a vectorfield $\beta$
in the space of all couplings, whose components 
$\beta_i(g)=\partial_t g_i$ (with $t=\ln k$)
are the beta functions.
A Fixed Point (FP) is a point $g_*$ in the space of all couplings where 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fp}
\beta_i(g_*)=0\ .
\end{equation}
For example, in ordinary quantum field theories in Minkowski space,
the point where all couplings vanish is always a FP
(called the Gaussian FP),
because a free field theory does not have quantum corrections.

Suppose that the theory admits a FP.
One defines the critical surface to be the locus of points
that, under the RG evolution, are attracted towards the FP for $t\to\infty$. 
Starting from any point on the critical surface, 
the UV limit can be taken safely, because the couplings,
and as a consequence the physical reaction rates,
will be drawn towards the FP and hence remain finite
\footnote{In general in the action there will be couplings
whose values do not affect cross-sections and reaction rates. 
They are called inessential couplings.
Our reasoning applies only to the essential couplings.}
On the other hand, if one starts from a point not belonging to the 
critical surface, the RG evolution will generally lead to
divergences.
If the critical surface has finite dimension $c$, 
the theory will be predictive, because only $c-1$ parameters
will be left undetermined and
will have to be fixed by experiment at a given energy scale
(the last remaining parameter being the scale itself).
The special case when the FP with a finite dimensional critical 
surface is the Gaussian FP is equivalent to
the usual perturbative notion of renormalizability 
and asymptotic freedom.

This scenario for nonperturbative renormalizability has been discussed
specifically in a gravitational context in \cite{Weinberg:1979} where
this good property was called ``asymptotic safety''.  At the time some
encouraging results were obtained by studying gravity in $2+\epsilon$
dimensions \cite{Weinberg:1979,Gastmans:1978ad}%
