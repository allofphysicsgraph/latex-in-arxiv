\begin{abstract}
Symmetry breaking can produce ``Alice'' strings, which alter scattered
charges and carry monopole number and charge when twisted into loops.
Alice behavior arises algebraically, when a string's untraced Wilson
loop obstructs unbroken symmetries --- a fragile criterion. We give a
topological criterion, compelling Alice behavior or deforming it
away. Our criterion, that $\pi_o(H)$ acts nontrivially on $\pi_1(H)$,
links topological Alice strings to topological monopoles. We twist
Alice loops to form monopoles, and find nematic and $^3$He-A Alice
strings are topological, carrying fundamental monopole charge when
twisted into loops.

\section{Introduction and Our Criterion}

Among the defects created when gauged symmetries break down are Alice
strings.\cite{oldAlice,stringzm,newAlice,blp} Alice strings obstruct
the global extension of unbroken symmetries, making them multivalued
when parallel transported around the string. This algebraic
obstruction has two prominent physical consequences. First, it
produces nonconservation of associated charges, when Aharonov-Bohm
scattered around the string. Second, it induces monopoles, as twisted
loops of Alice string.

These Alice features arise due to gauge flux on the string's core.
The gauge flux generates the condensate winding, while acting on
asymptotic particles through the Wilson line $U(\varphi)$. This action
fixes particles' Aharonov-Bohm scattering around the string, to one
changing both charge and monopole number. Loops of string, which
leave charge and monopole number well-defined asymptotically, thus
support deposited unlocalizable charge (``Cheshire charge'') and
deposited monopole number. \cite{oldAlice,stringzm} Alice loops carry
this deposited monopole number by twisting, \cite{blp} as we probe
further below.

Alice strings in condensed matter systems are global, not gauged,
defects. They have no gauge flux to fix their Aharonov-Bohm
scattering, and guarantee altered charge and monopole number upon
string traversal. However, their Aharonov-Bohm scattering was
considered in \cite{ABrefs, global}; with \cite{global} showing that
global Alice strings generically share all Alice behaviors.
They alter both charge and monopole number on string
traversal, with twisted loops supporting both Cheshire charge and
deposited monopole number.

The criterion for Alice string formation was first stated
algebraically, in terms of the string's untraced Wilson loop
$U(2\pi)$.  When $U(2\pi)$ fails to commute with an unbroken symmetry
$h$, the symmetry cannot be globally extended; when it fails to
commute with unbroken generator $T_h$, the associated charge is
nonconserved. Thus Alice strings arise when $U(2\pi)$ lies outside the
center of the unbroken symmetry group $H$. As noted in
\cite{stringzm}, this is an inherently nontopological criterion, as
topologically equivalent choices for $U(2\pi)$ can commute with
different subgroups of $H$. Thus
emergence of Alice behavior appeared a dynamical question. Steps
toward topologizing this criterion came in \cite{blp}. They noted that
when {\bf all} topologically equivalent choices for $U(2\pi)$ lie
outside the center of $H$, Alice strings must form. Equivalently,
topological Alice strings form when the fiber bundle of $H$ parallel
transported around the string is nontrivializable. Both criteria,
while accurate, seem difficult to apply.

We here establish an easily applied topological criterion which states
when Alice strings {\bf must} form.  A topologically stable string,
whose untraced Wilson loop $U(2\pi)$ induces Alice behavior --- by not
commuting with an unbroken generator $T_h$ --- must have flux
$U(2\pi)$ in a disconnected component of $H$. All choices for
$U(2\pi)$ in a single disconnected component of $H$ are
topologically equivalent; that is, the topology of the Alice string is
that of $\pi_o(H)$. Similarly, for $G$ and $H$ Lie groups, the
topology of the monopole is given by $\pi_1(H)$, describing loops
$h(\alpha)$ of different winding in $H$. By taking seriously the
change in  monopole number in circumnavigating the Alice
string, we construct our criterion. Note that, in Aharonov-Bohm
scattering around the string, the monopole $h(\alpha)$ is conjugated
by the Wilson loop $U(2\pi)$:
$$h(\alpha) \rightarrow \tilde{h} (\alpha) = U(2\pi)\ h(\alpha)\
U^{-1}(2\pi)\ \ .$$ Monopole number changes if $\tilde{h}(\alpha)$ and
$h(\alpha)$ are topologically distinct loops. We
represent this transformation topologically, as $\pi_o(H)$ acting
naturally on $\pi_1(H)$ by conjugation. Topological Alice strings form if
that action is nontrivial: that is, if, for $h_o$ a representative
element of $\pi_o(H)$ and $h(\alpha)$ a representative loop in
$\pi_1(H)$,
$$ \tilde{h} (\alpha) = h_o\ h(\alpha)\ h_o^{-1} \ \ \not\sim \ \
h(\alpha)\ \ .$$
A string with untraced Wilson loop $U(2\pi) \ \sim \ h_o$
meeting this criterion is topologically guaranteed to change monopole
number; we dub it a topological Alice string.

This criterion captures physical Alice behavior, is easily applied,
and is topological. Its result, for any chosen $ h_o$ and $h(\alpha)$, remainsinvariant under deformations
of either flux $U(2\pi) = h_o$ or monopole loop
$h(\alpha)$. By construction, the strings are topologically Alice if
monopoles change topologically in traversing them. Of
course, monopoles $h(\alpha)$ change because of algebraic Alice
behavior: loop $h(\alpha) = e^{i\alpha T_h}$ alters only if its
generator $T_h$ alters; that is, if $U(2\pi)$ fails to commute with
generator $T_h$. This algebraic noncommutation creates the standard
Alice constellation of behaviors: multivalued symmetry,
charge-violating Aharonov-Bohm scattering, Cheshire charge on Alice
loops. It is captured by our criterion {\bf only} when altering
generators  alters the topology of the loops they
generate. This misses some Alice phenomena --- particularly in models
with poorly distinguished loops, when $\pi_1(H) = 0$ (and all loops are trivial) or
$\pi_1(H) = Z_2$ (and all nontrivial loops, including a loop and its inverse, are identified). We claim that Alice behavior in these models is
not robust topologically; that is, continuous deformation of such
strings removes their Alice behavior. In such cases, persistence of
Alice behavior can arise only from dynamical arguments, favoring 
Alice strings over non-Alice strings of the same 
winding. While dynamically stabilized nontopological defects can 
play interesting roles --- {\em e.g.} as embedded, semilocal, or
electroweak strings \cite{semew} --- we seek here the deeper
motivation of topological imperative.

Note that this topological imperative comes at a cost: to fulfill our
topological criterion, of $\pi_o(H)$ acting nontrivially on
$\pi_1(H)$, $\pi_1(H)$ itself {\bf must be nontrivial}.  That is, only
in a theory with topological monopoles --- and more pointedly, monopoles
topologically distinct from antimonopoles --- do topological Alice
strings arise.

Our topological criterion for Alice strings ensures that twisted loops
carry monopole charge, as we see by explicit construction below.
%in section \ref{monopoles}. 
We note that topological arguments only indicate that
{\bf deposited} monopole charge can be carried by twisted Alice
loops. In many models, Alice strings interchange monopoles with
antimonopoles, depositing monopole charge in units of 2.  Whether
fundamental monopoles, or only those with even charge, are deformable
to twisted loops of Alice string is
model-dependent. We see both possibilities arise in 
\cite{loopmon}.%section \ref{models}.

We present our results as follows. 
%In section \ref{nontop}, we show
We first show
that Alice strings failing our topological test have topologically unstable Alice
features; that is, their Alice
behavior can be deformed away.  We then
show, by construction, that twisted Alice strings carry monopole
charge. 
%in section \ref{monopoles}. 
We argue topologically, using our criterion to display a 
twisted Alice loop, carrying monopole number deposited in the
monopole scattering $h(\alpha) \rightarrow \tilde{h}(\alpha)$. We then
illustrate our criterion and Alice loop twisting to form monopoles,
for key model: the Schwarz Alice string, 
coinciding with the Alice string of liquid crystals and of non-chiral
Bose condensates \cite{oldAlice, leonvol} and a nontopological Alice
string introduced in
\cite{stringzm}.
Key points include, for the nontopological model, a focus on how Alice
candidates may fail our criterion; and for the Schwarz string,
analysis of the monopole charge carried by twisted Alice loops. In
both the Schwarz and $^3$He-A Alice models, Alice strings scatter
change monopole number by 2, yet
twisted Alice loops carry a single fundamental unit of monopole
charge. Thus, for Alice strings in condensed matter, even the
fundamental monopole can be, in fact, a
twisted Alice loop. In contrast, model Alice loops discussed
elsewhere can support only even, not fundamental, monopole
charge.\cite{loopmon}

%We conclude in section \ref{conclusions}.
