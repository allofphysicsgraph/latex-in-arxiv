{\bf ABSTRACT}
\begin{quote}
For a quantum mechanical system with broken supersymmetry, it is
demonstrated that reformulation of the problem as that of a
$(1+1)$-D Dirac equation allows an easy determination of the
ground state if the corresponding energy eigenvalue is
sufficiently small. A simple expression is derived for the
approximate ground state energy in an associated, well-separated,
asymmetric double-well-type potential. Our discussion is also
relevant for the analysis of the fermion bound state in the
kink-antikink scalar background.
