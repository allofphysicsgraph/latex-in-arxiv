The existence of anomalous symmetry-breaking solutions of the 
SO(2,1)  commutator algebra is explicitly extended beyond 
the case of scale-invariant contact interactions. 
In particular, the 
failure of the conservation laws of the dilation and special conformal charges is 
displayed for the two-dimensional inverse square potential.
As a consequence, this anomaly appears to be a generic feature of conformal 
quantum mechanics and not merely an artifact of contact interactions.
Moreover, a renormalization procedure traces the emergence of this conformal 
anomaly to the ultraviolet sector of the theory, within which lies the apparent singularity.
