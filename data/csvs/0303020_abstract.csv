Torus-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds $Z$, with base $d{\mathbb P}_9$ and fundamental group $\pi_1(Z)={\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2 $, are reviewed. It is shown that $Z=X/({\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2)$, where $X=B \times_{\cp{1}} B^{'}$ are elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds that admit a freely acting ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ automorphism group. $B$ and $B^{'}$ are rational elliptic surfaces, each with a ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ group of automorphisms. It is shown that the  ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ invariant classes of curves of each surface have four generators which produce, via the fiber product, seven ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ invariant generators in $H_4(X,{\mathbb Z})$. All invariant homology classes are computed explicitly. These descend to produce a rank seven homology group $H_4(Z,{\mathbb Z})$ on $Z$. The existence of these homology  classes on $Z$ is essential to the construction of anomaly free, three family standard-like models with suppressed nucleon decay in both weakly and strongly coupled heterotic superstring theory.
