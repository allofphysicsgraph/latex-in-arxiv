The problem of constructing gauge invariant currents in terms
of light-cone bound-state wave functions is solved by utilising
the gauging of equations method.  In particular, it is shown how
to construct perturbative expansions
of the electromagnetic current in the light-cone formalism, such that
current conservation is satisfied at each order of the perturbation theory.
