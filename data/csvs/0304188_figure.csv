\caption{\label{fig:chiminall} (Left) Minimum reduced
$\chi^2/\nu$ as a function of $B$ for the fit
of the $b$-free model to the WMAP's TT (red triangles), TT+TE (red stars)
and TT+TE+2dF (red hollow squares) with corresponding best fit values of
$W-1$ (green squares) and $n_s-1$ (blue circles). We only show $W$ and $n_s$
from the fit to the TT data alone. The error bars correspond to the diagonal
elements of the covariance matrix. Adding the remaining data sets changes the
best fit values of $W$ and $n_s$ by only a small amount, well within the plotted error
bar. (Right) Same as on the left but for the
$b$-fixed model with all data sets included. In the left panel, $\nu=93$ and
in the right $\nu=94$. The values of the reduced $\chi^2/\nu$ at $B=0$ are,
in the left panel, 0.97 (TT), 1.1 (TT$+$TE) and 0.98 (TT$+$TE$+$2dF),
and 1.1 in the right panel.}
%IW to Levon I rescaled the nos. you sent me -- 0.974, 1.140 and 0.984
%in the left panel and 1.098 in the right panel -- by factors of
%92/93 (left) and 92/94 (right).
%Levon to IW: it wasn't necessary. I rescaled them back.

\caption{\label{fig:free}
(Left) Plots of the best fit $C_l^{TT}$ and $C_l^{TE}$ computed
using the $b$-free model for different values of $B$ together with the WMAP's binned data.
(Right) Corresponding plots of the galaxy clustering power spectra together with
the 2dFGRS data. On both plots, the solid line corresponds to $B=0$, dotted line - $B=0.05$,
short dash line - $B=0.1$, long dash line - $B=0.15$ and the dash-dot line corresponds to
the pure string contribution, i.e. $(W=0,B=1)$.}

Note that the $y$-axis has units of $\mu K$ and not $(\mu K)^2$ as on
the other $C_l$ plots.
