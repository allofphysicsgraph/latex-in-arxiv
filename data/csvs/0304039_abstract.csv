  In many high dimensional noncommutative theories, no state saturates
simultaneously all the non trivial Heisenberg uncertainty relations. This
differs  from the usual theory where the squeezed states possess this
property. The important role played by these states when recovering classical 
mechanics as a limit of  quantum theory makes  necessary  the
investigation of  the possible generalizations in the noncommutative
context. 

We propose an extension based on a variational
principle. The action considered is the sum  of the squares of the terms
associated to the non trivial Heisenberg  uncertainty relations. We first verify
that our proposal works in the usual theory: we find the known gaussian 
functions and, besides them, other states which can be expressed as products 
of gaussians with specific hypergeometrics.

We illustrate our construction in three models defined on a four dimensional
phase space: two models endowed with a minimal length uncertainty
 and the popular case in which
the  commutators of the positions are constants. In these three models, our proposal leads
to   second order partial differential equations. We find analytical solutions 
in specific cases. We briefly discuss how our method may be applied to the fuzzy sphere.

To emphasize that the recovering of  classical behaviours is not a trivial
question in the non commutative context, we show how the difference of structure between the
 Poisson brackets  and the
commutators in the  theories analyzed here generically leads to a loss of periodicity
for the harmonic oscillator.
