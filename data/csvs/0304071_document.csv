\begin{abstract}
We find self-adjoint extensions of the rational 
Calogero model in presence of the harmonic interaction. The corresponding
eigenfunctions may describe the near-horizon quantum states of certain types
of black holes.

\maketitle

	The dynamics of particles or fields in the near-horizon region of
black holes \cite{town1,town2} is often described in terms of the
Calogero Model \cite{calo}. In particular, it has been shown that the
existence of the near-horizon conformal symmetry \cite{carlip} as well as
the logarithmic correction to the black hole entropy \cite{kaul} can be
described in terms of the self-adjoint extension \cite{reed} of the 
Calogero model in absence of the confining potential \cite{ksg,ksg1}. 
On the other hand, it has been argued that in certain
string theoretic description of black holes, the near-horizon dynamics is
governed by a many particle Calogero model in presence of the confining
potential \cite{town2}.
It is therefore of interest to find the quantum states of this
model in presence of the self-adjoint extension. These states would be
expected to encode the dynamics for such black holes. A more detailed
description of the analysis presented below can be found in Ref.
\cite{ksg2}.

The Hamiltonian of the $N$- particle rational Calogero model \cite{calo} 
is given by
\be
H = - \sum^{N}_{i=1} \frac{{\partial}^2}{\partial x_i^2} +
\sum_{i \neq j} \left [ \frac{a^2 - \frac{1}{4}}{(x_i - x_j)^2} +
\frac{\Omega^2}{16} (x_i - x_j)^2 \right ]
\label{e0}
\ee
where $a$, $\Omega$ are constants, 
$x_i$ is the coordinate of the $i^{\rm th}$ particle and
units have been chosen such that $2 m {\hbar}^{- 2} = 1$.
We are interested in finding normalizable solutions of the
eigenvalue problem $H \psi = E \psi$ in a situation where the system admits
self-adjoint extensions. We consider the above eigenvalue equation
in a sector of configuration
space corresponding to a definite ordering of particles given by
$x_1 \geq x_2 \geq
\cdots \geq x_N$. The translation-invariant
 eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian $H$  can be written as
\be
\psi = \prod_{i <j} \left (x_i - x_j \right )^{a + \frac{1}{2}} \
\phi (r) \ P_k (x),
\label{e2}
\ee  
where $x \equiv (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N)$,
$r^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i < j} (x_i - x_j)^2$
and $P_k (x)$ is a translation-invariant as well as  homogeneous 
polynomial of degree $k(\geq 0)$ \cite{calo}. 
The radial part of the wavefunction
satisfies the equation $\tilde{H} \phi = E \phi$ where
\be
\tilde{H} = \left [ - \frac{d^2}{dr^2} - (1 + 2 \nu )
\frac{1}{r} \frac{d}{d r} + w^2 r^2 \right ],
\ee
$w^2 = \frac{1}{8} \Omega^2 N $ and
$\nu = k + \frac{1}{2}(N - 3) + \frac{1}{2} N (N-1)(a + \frac{1}{2})$.
