\begin{abstract}
We consider non-supersymmetric large $N$ orientifold field theories.
 Specifically, we discuss a gauge theory with a Dirac
 fermion in the anti-symmetric tensor representation. We argue that, at large
$N$ and in a
large part of its bosonic sector, this theory is non-perturbatively equivalent
to \None SYM, so that exact results established in
the latter (parent) theory  also hold in the daughter orientifold theory.
 In particular, the non-supersymmetric theory has an exactly calculable
bifermion
 condensate, exactly degenerate parity doublets, and
 a vanishing cosmological constant (all this to leading order
in $1/N$).
