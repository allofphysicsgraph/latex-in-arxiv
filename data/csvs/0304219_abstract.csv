Numerical solutions of Einstein's and scalar-field equations are found
for a global defect in a higher-dimensional spacetime.  The defect has
a $(3+1)$-dimensional core and a ``hedgehog'' scalar-field
configuration in $n=3$ extra dimensions.  For sufficiently low
symmetry-breaking scales $\eta$, the solutions are characterized by a
flat worldsheet geometry and a constant solid deficit angle in the
extra dimensions, in agreement with previous work.  For $\eta$ above
the higher-dimensional Planck scale, we find that static-defect
solutions are singular.  The singularity can be removed if the
requirement of staticity is relaxed and defect cores are allowed to
inflate.  We obtain an analytic solution for the metric of such
inflating defects at large distances from the core.  The three extra
dimensions of the nonsingular solutions have a ``cigar'' geometry.
Although our numerical solutions were obtained for defects of
codimension $n=3$, we argue that the conclusions are likely to apply
to all $n\geq 3$.
