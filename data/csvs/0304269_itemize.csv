\item
Eqs.\rf{Tension-sol}--\rf{X-sol} tell us that the modified-measure
(closed) string with $N$ point-like (``color'') charges on it 
(\rf{string-action-plus} or \rf{string-action-NA-plus}) is equivalent to $N$ 
chain-wise connected regular open string segments (stretching from $\s_i$ to
$\s_{i+1}$, $i=0,1,\ldots ,N-1$) which obey Neumann boundary conditions. 
\item
Each of the above open string segments, with end-points at the charges
$e_{i}$ and $e_{i+1}$ (in the Abelian case) or $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$ (in the 
non-Abelian case), has {\em different} constant string tension $T_{i,i+1}$
such that $T_{i,i+1} = T_{i-1,i} + \stackrel{(\sim )}{e}_i$ (the non-Abelian
${\wti e}_i$ are defined in \rf{Tension-sol}).
\item
Eq.\rf{charge-constr-NA} shows that the only (classically) admissable 
configuration of ``color'' point-like charges coupled to a modified-measure 
closed bosonic string is the one with {\em zero} total ``color'' charge, 
\textsl{i.e.}, the model \rf{string-action-NA-plus} provides a classical 
mechanism of ``color'' charge confinement.

\item
There exist natural from physical point of view modifications of world-sheet and
world-volume integration measures which may significantly affect string and brane
dynamics. 
\item
Consistency of dynamics {\em naturally}~ requires the introduction of auxiliary
world-sheet vector gauge field (in the string case) and higher-rank world-volume
antisymmetric tensor gauge fields in the general brane case beyond the
standard $Dp$-brane $U(1)$ vector gauge field.
\item
The string/brane tension is {\em not}~ anymore a constant scale given {\em ad hoc},
but rather appears as an {\em additional dynamical degree of freedom}~ beyond the
ordinary string/brane degrees of freedom.
\item
The dynamical string/brane tension has physical meaning of an electric field
strength for the auxiliary world-sheet/world-volume gauge field.
\item
The dynamical string/brane tension obeys ``Gauss law'' constraint equation
and may be nontrivially variable in the presence of point-like charges (on
the string world-sheet) or charged lower-dimensional branes (on the
$Dp$-brane world-volume).
\item
Modified-measure string/brane models provide simple classical mechanisms for
confinement of point-like ``color'' charges or charged lower-dimensional branes
due to variable dynamical tension.
