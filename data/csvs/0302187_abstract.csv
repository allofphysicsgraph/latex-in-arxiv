The free Schr\""odinger equation with mass $\cal M$ can be turned into a
non-massive Klein-Gordon equation via Fourier transformation with respect to
$\cal M$. The kinematic symmetry algebra $\mathfrak{sch}_d$ of the free
$d$-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation with $\cal M$ fixed appears
therefore naturally as a parabolic subalgebra of the complexified
conformal algebra $\mathfrak{conf}_{d+2}$ in $d+2$ dimensions. The explicit
classification of the parabolic subalgebras of $\mathfrak{conf}_3$ yields
physically interesting dynamic symmetry algebras. This allows us to
propose a new dynamic symmetry group relevant for the description
of ageing far from thermal equilibrium, with a dynamical exponent $z=2$. 
The Ward identities resulting from the invariance under 
$\mathfrak{conf}_{d+2}$ and its parabolic subalgebras are derived and the 
corresponding free-field energy-momentum tensor is constructed. We also
derive the scaling form and the causality conditions for the two- and 
three-point functions and their relationship
with response functions in the context of Martin-Siggia-Rose theory.
