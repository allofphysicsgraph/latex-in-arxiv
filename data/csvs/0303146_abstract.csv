This work presents a classification of all
smooth 't Hooft--Jackiw--Nohl--Rebbi instantons over Gibbons--Hawking
spaces. That is, we find all smooth $SU(2)$ Yang--Mills instantons over
these spaces which arise by conformal rescalings of the metric with
suitable functions. 

Since the Gibbons--Hawking spaces are hyper-K\""ahler gravitational
instantons, the rescaling functions must be positive harmonic. 
By using twistor methods we present integral formulae for the kernel of
the Laplacian associated to these spaces. These integrals are
generalizations of the classical Whittaker--Watson formula. By the aid 
of these we prove that all 't Hooft instantons were
already found in a recent paper \cite{ete-hau3}. 

This result also shows that actually all such smooth 't
Hooft--Jackiw--Nohl--Rebbi instantons describe singular magnetic
monopoles on the flat three-space with zero magnetic charge moreover the
reducible ones generate the full $L^2$ cohomolgy of the Gibbons--Hawking
spaces.
