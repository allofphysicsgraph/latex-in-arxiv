Brane gas cosmology is a scenario inspired by string
theory which proposes a simple resolution to the initial 
singularity problem and gives a dynamical explanation 
for the number of spatial dimensions of our universe.
In this work we have studied analytically and numerically
the late-time behaviour of these type of cosmologies 
taking a proper care of the annihilation of winding modes.
This has help us to clarify and extend several aspects of 
their dynamics.
We have found that the decay of winding states into 
non-winding states behaving like a gas of ordinary 
non-relativistic particles precludes the existence of a 
late expansion phase of the universe and obstructs the 
growth of three large spatial dimensions as we observe 
today.
We propose a generic solution to this problem by 
considering the dynamics of a gas of non-static branes.
We have also obtained a simple criterion on the initial 
conditions to ensure the small string coupling approximation 
along the whole dynamical evolution, and consequently, the 
consistency of an effective low-energy description.
Finally, we have reexamined the general conditions for a 
loitering period in the evolution of the universe which could 
serve as a mechanism to resolve the {\sl brane problem} - a 
problem equivalent to the {\sl domain wall problem} in 
standard cosmology -  and discussed the scaling properties of 
a self-interacting network of winding modes taking into account 
the effects of the dilaton dynamics.
