\caption{A system in a mixed state $\rho$ is coupled to some environment, $\rho_{E}$.  The joint system undergoes unitary evolution $U$.  From the output, $\m(\rho)$ is extracted, a system in a new mixed state which may or may not have the same dimensionality as the original system.  The transformation $\m$ is a linear, trace-preserving, completely positive operator. }

\caption{a) Unitary evolution for the complete pair $\xi\preceq \zeta$ gives a $*$-isomorphism $\m(\xi,\zeta)$ between the corresponding algebras. b) The acausal set $\xi$ is a complete past of $z$.  $\m(\xi,z)$ is a $*$-homomorphism.  c) In this case, $\m(x,z)$ is only a completely positive map.}
