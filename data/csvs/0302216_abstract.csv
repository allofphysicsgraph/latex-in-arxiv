Quantum particles confined to surfaces in higher dimensional spaces are acted
upon by forces that exist only as a result of the surface geometry and the
quantum mechanical nature of the system. The dynamics are particularly rich
when confinement is implemented by forces that act normal to the surface. We
review this \emph{confining potential formalism} applied to the confinement
of a particle to an arbitrary manifold embedded in a higher dimensional
Euclidean space. We devote special attention to the geometrically induced
gauge potential that appears in the effective Hamiltonian for motion on the
surface. We emphasize that the gauge potential is only present when the space
of states describing the degrees of freedom normal to the surface is
degenerate. We also distinguish between the effects of the intrinsic and
extrinsic geometry on the effective Hamiltonian and provide simple
expressions for the induced scalar potential. We discuss examples including
the case of a 3-dimensional manifold embedded in a 5-dimensional Euclidean
space.
