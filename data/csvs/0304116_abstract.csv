   The quantum statistical mechanics of generally covariant systems --particles, strings and membranes-- on noncommutative field spaces is studied.  We discuss how to introduce non-local communication among different systems via noncommutativity. This idea is applied to cosmology where we argue that due to the breaking of relativistic invariance  one can consider a privileged  reference system where many universes interact as a quantum gas in a reservoir. If roughly  speaking, we approximate the universes as tensionless membranes, then,  the interaction among universes 
   provided by noncommutativity is harmonic. The oscillation frequency for each universe is proportional to $B/M$, where $B$ is the  noncommutativity parameter  --that we identify as the primordial magnetic field,  {\it i.e.}  $\sim 10^{-16}\, \mbox{GeV}^2$- and $M$ is the mass of the 
   universe ( $\sim 10^{77} \mbox{GeV}$) and, therefore each universe have the  pulsation frequency  $\omega \sim 10^{-68} \,s^{-1}$.
