\caption{{\footnotesize
Plot of $p^2 I^{\rm spin}(p^2)$ against $\ln(p/M)$, showing a
comparison of the form factor approach to 2--loop perturbation theory.
The solid curve is the FF approximation to $p^2 I^{\rm spin}(p^2)$ obtained by
including all intermediate states with $\le 7$ particles. The lower curves
show the analogous approximations with $\le5,\le3,1$ particles 
respectively. The normalization of the (dashed) PT curve is fixed 
according to (\ref{lambda1}).
Finally the top curve is the PT curve multiplied by a factor $1.05$.
