We show that a large class of supersymmetric compactifications, including all
simply connected Calabi-Yau and $G_2$
manifolds, have classical configurations with negative energy density as
seen from four dimensions. In fact, the energy density can be
arbitrarily negative -- it is unbounded from below. Nevertheless, 
positive energy theorems show that the
total ADM energy remains positive. Physical consequences of the
negative 
energy density include new thermal instabilities, and possible violations
of cosmic censorship.
