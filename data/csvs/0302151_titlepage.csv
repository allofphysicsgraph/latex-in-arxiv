\begin{abstract}
We propose an analytic framework to study the nonperturbative
solutions of Witten's open string field theory.
The method is based on the Moyal star formulation
where the kinetic term can be split into two parts.
The first one describes the spectrum of two identical half strings
which are independent from each other.
The second one, which we call midpoint correction,
shifts the half string spectrum to that of
the standard open string.  We show that the nonlinear equation
of motion of string field theory is exactly solvable
at zeroth order in the midpoint correction.
An infinite number of solutions are classified in
terms of projection operators. Among them,
there exists only one stable solution which is identical to
the standard butterfly state.
We include the effect of the midpoint
correction around each exact zeroth order
solution as a perturbation expansion which can be
formally summed to the complete exact solution.
