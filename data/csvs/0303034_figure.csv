\epsfig{file=fig1.eps,width=0.9\textwidth} \caption{The
upper/lower horizontal boundaries are future null infinity (${\cal
I}^+$)/past null infinity (${\cal I}^-$) of $r=\infty$. For
AdS-black hole, the horizontal lines belong to spacelike
singularity of $r=0$. The vertical lines are spacelike singularity
of $r=0$ for Kerr-de Sitter spacetime, while these are timelike
infinity of $r=\infty$ for AdS-black hole. For Kerr-de Sitter
spacetime, we call two regions with $0 \le r \le 1$ as northern
diamond (ND) and southern diamond (SD). An observer at $r=0$ is
surrounded by a cosmological horizon $r=r_+$. Two regions with $1
\le r \le \infty$ are called future triangle (FT) including ${\cal
I}^+$ and past triangle (PT) including ${\cal I}^-$. The correct
wave propagation is possible only in the southern diamond because
a timelike Killing vector $\partial /
\partial t$ is future-directed only in this region. The
arrow($\rightarrow$) is the flow direction generated by the
timelike Killing vector. Two of Kerr-de Sitter and AdS-black hole
do not have a global timelike Killing vector.} \label{fig1}

\epsfig{file=fig2.eps,width=0.9\textwidth} \caption{In de Sitter
spacetime, $r=0$ is just a coordinate origin and $r=r_c=\ell$ is a
position of the cosmological horizon. On the other hand, for $J
\ne 0$ (Kerr-de Sitter space) $r=0$ becomes a conical singularity
where a spinning source exists. Instead a role of $r=0$ in de
Sitter space is split into $r=\pm i r_{(-)}$ ($r^2 = -r_{(-)}^2$)
in Kerr-de Sitter space. That is, if $J \rightarrow 0$, $\pm i
r_{(-)} \rightarrow 0$. Further $r=r_+$ is a position of the
cosmological horizon for $J \ne 0$. Hence, to solve the wave
equation explicitly, one introduces a coordinate $z=r^2/\ell^2
(0\le z \le 1)$ for de Sitter case, whereas one introduces $z =
{{r^2+r_{(-)}^2} \over {r_+^2 + r_{(-)}^2}}$( $0 \le z \le 1$) for
Kerr-de Sitter case. For $J \ne 0$, $r=0$ corresponds to $z_0
={{r_{(-)}^2} \over {r_+^2 + r_{(-)}^2}}$ located between $z=0$
and $z=1$. Even though this complex picture (b) seems to be
unphysical, it is useful for solving the wave equation in Kerr-de
Sitter space.} \label{fig2}
