Vertex symmetry for interacting fermions will be shown to lead to 
a Lagrangian exhibiting $SU(2N)_{W}$ invariance associated with the subgroup 
$SU(2N)_{q} \times SU(2N)_{\bar{q}}$ generated by C-odd and C-even spin operators.
Approximate $SU(6)_W$ vertex symmetry as well as chiral invariance will then be shown to follow from a principle of maximum smoothness (M\""oller-Rosenfeld) of the bound state quark wave function.
