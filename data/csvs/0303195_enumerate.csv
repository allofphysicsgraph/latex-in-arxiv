\item When $|K^\mu(t)|$ diverges as $t$ tends to infinity,
Eqs.~(\ref{ineq1}) and (\ref{ineq2}) cannot possibly be true
simultaneously.
\item If for large $t$, $K^\mu(t)$ approaches a nonzero constant
$K^\mu(\infty)$, the integral in Eq.~(\ref{ineq1}) asymptotically
approaches $K^\mu(\infty)t$. If we now choose
$\epsilon<\left|K^\mu(\infty)\right|$, then bounds (\ref{ineq1}) and
(\ref{ineq2}) still cannot be consistent for all $t\ge 0$ since
$\Delta(R)$ is finite (see Figure~\ref{figure}). It follows that the
only resolution is to set $K^\mu(\infty)=0$. Since the function $f(r)$
in Eq.~(\ref{K}) is general (up to satisfying the requirements
described above), we conclude that the gauge fields must
asymptotically approach zero as $t$ increases.  From the equations of
motion it then follows that the matter currents approach zero as
well. Note, since the matter currents $J_A$ vanish for the pure matter
Lagrangian, our conclusion does not limit the form of pure matter
solitons. For example, $J_\phi\not =0$ is not required.
\item If for large $t$, the function $K^\mu(t)$ approaches a periodic
function with oscillations around a constant $K^\mu(\infty)$, we
similarly conclude that $K^\mu(\infty)=0$, otherwise (\ref{ineq1}) and
(\ref{ineq2}) are again violated, and it follows that for large $t$
the gauge fields and the matter currents must periodically oscillate
around zero. Consequently, the matter fields becomes periodic in time
for large $t$.\"
