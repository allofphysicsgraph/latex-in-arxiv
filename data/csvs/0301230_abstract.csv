We construct  low energy effective Lagrangians for 3d ${\cal N}=4$
supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory with any gauge group.
They represent supersymmetric $\sigma$ models at
hyper--K\""ahlerian manifolds of dimension $4r$ ($r$ is the rang
of the group).
In the asymptotic region, perturbatively exact explicit
expression for the metric are written.
We establish the relationship of this metric
with  the TAUB-NUT metric describing
the perturbatively exact effective
Lagrangians for unitary groups and  monopole moduli spaces:
the former is obtained out of the latter by a proper
hyper--K\""ahlerian reduction.
We describe in details the reduction procedure for $SO/Sp/G_2$
gauge groups, where it can also be given a natural interpretation
in $D$-brane language.
We conjecture that the exact nonperturbative
metrics can be obtained by a similar hyper--K\""ahlerian
reduction from the corresponding multidimensional Atiyah--Hitchin metrics.
