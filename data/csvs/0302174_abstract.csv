We analyze $N=2,1,0$ vacua of type IIB string theory on $\mathbf{K3}\times
\mathbf{T}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ in presence of three-form fluxes from a four
dimensional supergravity viewpoint. The quaternionic geometry of
the $\mathbf{K3}$ moduli space together with the special geometry of the NS
and R-R dilatons and of the $\mathbf{T}^2$-complex structure moduli play a
crucial role in the analysis. The introduction of fluxes
corresponds to a particular gauging of $N=2$, $D=4$ supergravity.
Our results agree with a recent work of Tripathy and Trivedi. The
present formulation shows the power of supergravity  in the study
of effective theories with broken supersymmetry.
