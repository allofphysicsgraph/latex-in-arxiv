        We explain how structures related to octonions are ubiquitous in 
$M$-theory. All the exceptional Lie groups, and the projective Cayley 
line and plane
appear in $M$-theory. Exceptional $G_2$-holonomy manifolds show up as
compactifying spaces, and are related to the $M$2 Brane and 3-form. We review
this evidence, which comes from the initial 11-dim structures. 
Relations between
these objects are stressed, when extant and understood. We argue for the
necessity of a better understanding of the role of the octonions themselves (in
particular non-associativity) in $M$-theory.
