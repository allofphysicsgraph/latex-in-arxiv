7,"\cite {baf}, the Ansatz (\ref{genu}) follows
from the conformal symmetry of
the equations of motion.
If one assumes that $f$ is a function of
$T\equiv R^2 \equiv uu^*$ only,  $\pa_{u^*}f$ simplifies to
$\pa_{u^*}f =f_{,T}\, u$. With the Ansatz (\ref{genu}),
this results in an ordinary differential
equation for $R(\eta)$, which may be conveniently expressed in terms of
$T\equiv R^2 \equiv uu^*$ as
\be
\left( \ln \frac{T_{,\eta}}{f}\right) _{,\eta}
= \frac{\cosh \eta }{\sinh \eta}
\frac{n^2 -2m^2 \sinh^2 \eta}{n^2 +m^2 \sinh^2 \eta}
\ee
and $X_{,\eta}$ denotes derivative of $X$ w.r.t. $\eta$.
Further, we assume $m^2 >n^2$ in the sequel.
A first integral may be found easily,
\be \label{1-int}
\frac{T_{,\eta}}{f}=k_1 \frac{\sinh\eta}{(n^2 +m^2\sinh^2 \eta)^{3/2}}
\ee
(here $k_1$ is a constant of integration),
whereas for a further integration the explicit form of the function $f(T)$
is needed.

In the end, we shall choose $f=(1+T)^2$, because we are refering  to the
solutions of Babelon and Ferreria \cite{baf}, but let us briefly mention a
class of functions $f(T)$ that leads to a target space with the topology of the
two-sphere and, therefore, to genuine Hopf solitons, which can have useful
applications. For $f=(1+T)^2$,
the expression $h_{ij}/f$ in the Lagrangian density (\ref{lagr})
is, in fact, just the pull-back under the
map $u$ of the area two-form
\be \label{s2-ar}
d\Omega =-i\frac{dzdz^*}{(1+zz^*)^2}
\ee
on the two-sphere. A pull-back of this two-form under maps $S^2 \to S^2$
will lead to further acceptable area two-forms (i.e. area two-forms
respecting the topology of the target space). If we want to maintain the
simple dependence $f=f(T)$, then a class of allowed maps is
 \be
\phi \, :\;  z\to \sqrt{g(zz^*)}e^{il\arg (z)} .
\ee
These are indeed maps $S^2 \to S^2$ provided that $g(0)=0$ and $g(\infty)=
\infty$. Further, $l$ must be an integer. The pullback of the area two-form
(\ref{s2-ar}) is
\be
\phi_* (d\Omega ) =-i\frac{dzdz^*lg'}{(1+g)^2}
\ee
therefore any function $f$ of the type
\be
f(T)=\frac{(1+g(T))^2}{l\, g_{,T}}
\ee
leads to a theory (\ref{lagr}) with genuine Hopf solitons.

In the sequel we restrict to the simplest case $f=(1+T)^2$ (the area
two-form on the two-sphere).
Then the first integral (\ref{1-int}) may be easily integrated
to yield
\be
{1 \o 1+T } = { k_1 \o  (m^2 -n^2)} { \cosh \eta
  \o ( n^2  + m^2
\sinh^2 \eta )^{1/2} } +k_2
\label{fspone}
\ee
where $k_1 $ and $k_2$ are two constants of integration.
These constants have to be fixed by imposing some boundary conditions on
the field $u$. For this purpose let us introduce the unit vector $\vec n$
related to $u$ via stereographic projection
\be
{\vec n} = {1\o {1+\mid u\mid^2}} \, ( u+u^* , -i ( u-u^* ) , \u2 -1 ) \; ;
\qquad
u  = \frac{n_1 + i n_2}{1 - n_3}.
\label{stereo}
\ee
If $u$ is supposed to be a true Hopf map, then the number of allowed
boundary conditions is, in fact, very restricted.
The point is that a true Hopf map should cover the whole target $S^2$,
including the north pole ($\vec n = (0,0,1)$, or $T=\infty$) and the
south pole ($\vec n = (0,0,-1)$, or $T=0$). Therefore, the boundary
conditions should be chosen such that $T$ varies between $T=0$ and
$T=\infty$. Further, the pre-images of the north pole and the south pole
should be one-dimensional lines in $I\hspace{-0.1cm} R^3$. However,
the only values
of $\eta$ which define one-dimensional lines (instead of two-dimensional tori,
as is the general case), are $\eta =0$, which
defines the $z$ axis (together with spatial infinity), and $\eta =\infty$,
which defines the circle
\be
C=\{\vec x \in I\hspace{-0.12cm} R^3 :\;  z=0 \;
\wedge \; r^2 =1\}.
\ee
Therefore, there are two possible choices for the boundary conditions, namely
$T(\eta =0)=0$, $T(\eta =\infty) =\infty$, or
$T(\eta =0)=\infty$, $T(\eta =\infty) =0$.

In \cite{baf} the second option was chosen (which we call $T^{(2)}$ for
convenience),
\be
T^{(2)}=
 {   \cosh \eta  - \sqrt{n^2/m^2 +\sinh^2 \eta}  \o
 \sqrt{1 + m^2/n^2\,\sinh^2 \eta  }  -   \cosh \eta  } \quad ,
T^{(2)}(\eta =0)=\infty \; ,T^{(2)}(\eta =\infty) =0.
\ee
Let us now investigate our first option, for which we get
\be
T^{(1)}=
 (T^{(2)})^{-1} \quad ,
T^{(1)}(\eta =0)=0 \; ,T^{(1)}(\eta =\infty) =\infty .
\ee
Now one could simply identify the solitons with the position of their
singular value $|u|=\infty$, then the solitons of type $T^{(2)}$ would be
identified with the straight line $x=0,y=0$ (the $z$ axis), and the
solitons of type $T^{(1)}$ would be ascribed to the circle $C$.
However, this identification is in principle  quite arbitrary, and requires
a physical
motivation.

In \cite{baf} it was shown  that the solitions of type $T^{(2)}$ can
indeed be identified with the z axis in a well-defined manner. More
precisely, there exists a conserved current $ J_\mu$ which has the property
that for solitons of type $T^{(2)}$ it is singular along the $z$ axis.
Moreover, a constant flow of this current is emerging from the singular line
(the $z$ axis). Here we want to investigate the equivalent problem for
solitons of type $T^{(1)}$, which is relevant as rings are common in
higher dimensional solitons \cite{sut}, \cite{ward}.

So let us briefly review  some results of \cite{baf} on the above-mentioned
conserved current, with some  more details required for our purposes.
There exists
 (among other symmetries) a symmetry of
the action under a transformation which is a combination of a dilatation
on three-dimensional domain space plus a specific
transformation on target space.
The conserved Noether current related to this symmetry transformation is
\be
J_\mu =x^\nu \Theta_{\mu\nu} +j_\mu
\ee
where $\Theta_{\mu\nu}$ is the canonical energy-momentum tensor of the
theory, and $j_\mu$ is
\be
j_\mu =-i\left( \frac{h^2}{2(1+T)^4}\right)^{-1/4}\frac{1}{2(1+T)^3}
h_{\mu\nu} (u\pa^\nu u^* - u^* \pa^\nu u) .
\ee
Here, the first term of $J_\mu$ (containing the energy-momentum tensor) is
due to the space dilatation, whereas the second term, $j_\mu$, is due to
the specific target space transformation. The current obeys the
conservation equation $\pa^\mu J_\mu =0$. For static configurations
$u (\vec x)$ this conservation equation may be used to derive the relation
\be \label{cons}
E\equiv \pa_t \int d^3 xJ^0 =\int_\Sigma d \vec f \cdot \vec J
\ee
where $E$ is the static energy of the static configuration,
\be \label{stat-e}
E=4\pi^2 \sqrt{|m||n|(|m| + |n|)}\, ,
\ee
and the integral in the r.h.s. of (\ref{cons}) is an integral over
surfaces $\Sigma$ which
surround the singularities of the current $\vec J$.
It turns out that the first term of the current for static fields,
$x^j \Theta_{ij}$, is regular everywhere and may, therefore, be ignored
in the surface integral of (\ref{cons}) provided that the integration
surfaces are chosen such that their volume is infinitesimal.
For the current $\vec j$ we find after some calculation
\be
\vec j = \left(  \left\vert
\frac{T_{,\eta}}{(1+T)^2}\right\vert \right)^{1/2} \frac{T}{1+T}
\left( \frac{n^2}{\sinh^2 \eta} +m^2\right)^{3/4} ( \cosh \eta -\cos \xi )^2
\vec e_\eta
\ee
where $\vec e_\eta = (\cosh\eta - \cos\xi )^{-1}\nabla\eta$ is a vector of
unit length which is perpendicular to the surfaces of constant $\eta$ (tori).
Observe that $\vec e_\eta $ is pointing into the interior of the tori,
because $\eta$ is growing in this direction.
We may use the first integral of the equations of motion, (\ref{1-int}),
for the first factor on the r.h.s.
containing $T_{,\eta}$, and find
\be
 \vec j = \sqrt{\vert m\vert \vert n\vert (\vert m \vert +
\vert n\vert )}\frac{T}{1+T}
\frac{(\cosh \eta -\cos \xi )^2}{\sinh \eta} \vec e_\eta .
\ee
If we ignore the factor $T/(1+T)$ for the moment, then we see that the
remaining expression is singular both for $\eta =0$ (along the $z$ axis)
and for $\eta =\infty$ (along the circle $C$). Depending on whether we choose
$T^{(1)}$ or $T^{(2)}$ for $T$, one of the two singularities gets cancelled,
whereas the other remains. For $T=T^{(2)}$ (the case which was studied in
\cite{baf}), the singularity along the $z$ axis remains. In this case we choose
a very large torus $\eta  <<1$ as integration surface. For the regular terms
the limit $\eta  \to 0$ may be performed, such that the integration is
extended to the whole space. For the singular $\vec j$ the surface integral
should be performed for a finite $\eta$ and the limit $\eta \to 0$ should
be taken afterwards.
The surface element on the torus surface $\eta ={\rm const}$ is
\be
d\vec f = \vec e_\eta \frac{\sinh \eta}{(\cosh\eta -\cos \xi )^2}d \vp d
\xi
 \ee
therefore the surface integral is
\br  \label{surf-i}
\int _{\eta ={\rm const}} \vec j\cdot d\vec f &=&
\sqrt{\vert m\vert \vert n\vert (\vert m \vert +
\vert n\vert )} \frac{T}{1+T}\int d\vp d\xi  \nonumber \\
&=&
4\pi^2 \sqrt{\vert m\vert \vert n\vert (\vert m \vert +
\vert n\vert )} \frac{T}{1+T}
 \er
 For $T=T^{(2)}$ this should be evaluated in the limit $ \eta  \to 0$ for
which $T^{(2)}/(1+T^{(2)})$ is equal to one. Therefore the total
flux emerging from the singular line (the $z$ axis) is
 \be \label{flux}
{ \rm flux} =4\pi^2 \sqrt{\vert m\vert \vert n\vert (\vert m \vert +
\vert n\vert )} =E
 \ee
where $E$ is the static energy (\ref{stat-e}).

On the other hand, for $T=T^{(1)}$ the singularity is located at the circle
$C$, therefore a
tiny torus (large  $ \eta$) should be excluded from the integration region.
So we take the limit $ \eta  \to  \infty$ now in the surface integral
(\ref{surf-i}). But $T^{(1)}/(1+T^{(1)})$ is equal to one in this limit,
so we find again for the flux the same previous expression  (\ref{flux}) .

Therefore, for solutions of the type $T^{(1)}$ the singular line is the circle
$C$ and a non-zero flux of total amount given in (\ref{flux}) emerges
from this singular circle. As a consequence,
the solutions of type $T^{(1)}$ are
characterized by a ring-like structure, where the ring is located at the
position of the circle $C$, which , as said, is relevant for their physics
and specially for the scattering.

\section{Discussion}

So we indeed found that in addition to the solutions of type $T^{(2)}$
originally obtained by Aratyn, Ferreira and Zimerman (AFZ) in \cite{afz},
which are characterized by a straight
line of singular flux according to Babelon and Ferreira, there exist
solutions where the singular flux is
located along the circle $C$, forming thereby a ring-like structure.
In hindsight, this result is not so surprising, and the ring-like structure
is, in fact, the generic case. To see this, let us invoke a further
symmetry of the model, namely  constant rotations of the target space
$S^2$. In domain space $I\hspace{-0.1cm}R^3$ such a rotation rotates
different level curves (i.e., curves of constant $u=u_0$ for different
values of $u_0$) into each other, because these level curves are the
pre-images of points of the target $S^2$ under the map $u$.
Generically, these level curves are circles, with the only exception of
the $z$ axis. Therefore, any rotation on target space which moves the
north pole and the south pole will transform a solution of type $T^{(2)}$
into a new solution where the line of singular flux is located along a
circle.

On the target space coordinate $u$ such rotations are represented by
modular transformations $u\to (a+bu)/(c+du)$, where $ad-bc =1$. A general
modular transformation is, however, not compatible with the simple Ansatz
(\ref{genu}) which was used by AFZ to find solutions. The only non-trivial
modular transformation compatible with the ansatz (\ref{genu}) is the
inversion map $u\to (1/u)$. And indeed, the composition of the inversion
map with the map $(m,n)\to (-m,-n)$ (which again maps a solution to
another solution with the same energy) precisely maps the AFZ solutions
$T^{(2)}$ to the solutions of type $T^{(1)}$ discussed in this paper.

Besides their interest for the scattering, the results can also be
useful - given
the generic features of the theory considered - for other higher
dimensional models  on the sphere
and/or using similar scaling arguments, like Skyrme theory and its restriction
to the $SU(2)/U(1)$ coset.
