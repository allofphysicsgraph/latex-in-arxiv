We investigate the correspondence between the
D2-brane, which is described by the abelian Born-Infeld action, 
and multiple D0-branes,
which are done by the nonabelian Born-Infeld action.
We construct effective actions for the fuzzy cylinder,
sphere and plane formed via D0-branes
and compare these actions with those for the cylindrical, 
spherical and planar D2-brane. We show that in the continuous limit,
the effective actions for the fuzzy D0-branes 
precisely coincide with those for the single D2-brane 
if both the fuzziness of the D0-brane and the area occupied per a
unit of magnetic flux on the D2-brane are equal to $(2\pi\ell_s)^2$.
