\caption{Motion of the radion $\psi$ in the potential $V(\psi)$.
In the left figure all the exponentials in the potential are positive.
The field starts out at $\psi\to+\infty$ with very large (infinite)
kinetic energy. Around the point where it turns around, the energy is
potential-dominated and acceleration occurs. In the right figure there
is a combination of a positive exponential (coming from four-form flux)
and a negative exponential (from spherical compactification). We show
two trajectories: one reaches $V(\psi)>0$ and hence produces positive
acceleration (although the universe may be expanding or collapsing). The
other turns around at $V=0$ and therefore does not lead to acceleration.
All these possibilities are realized in the solutions described in the
text. The asymptotic future behavior is determined by the attractor
solutions of each potential.
