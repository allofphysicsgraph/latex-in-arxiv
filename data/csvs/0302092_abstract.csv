We confirm earlier hints that the conventional phase diagram of the discrete chiral Gross-Neveu model 
in the large $N$ limit is deficient at non-zero chemical potential. We present the corrected phase diagram constructed  
in mean field theory. It has three different phases, including a kink-antikink crystal
phase. All transitions are second order. The driving mechanism for the new structure 
of baryonic matter in the Gross-Neveu model is an 
Overhauser type instability with gap formation at the Fermi surface.
