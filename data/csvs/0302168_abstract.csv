BRST invariant gluon-ghost condensate of mass dimension 2 in the
Curci-Ferrari gauge in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills is analysed by combining
the local composite operator technique with the algebraic
renormalization. We pay attention to the gauge parameter
independence of the vacuum energy obtained in the considered
framework and discuss the Landau gauge as an interesting special
case.
