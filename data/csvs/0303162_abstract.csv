 When calculating higher terms of the $\varepsilon$-expansion
 of massive Feynman diagrams, one needs to evaluate
 particular cases of multiple inverse binomial sums.
 These sums are related to the derivatives of certain
 hypergeometric functions with respect to their parameters.
 We explore this connection and
 analytically calculate a number of such infinite sums,
 for an arbitrary value of the argument which corresponds to
 an arbitrary value of the off-shell external momentum.
 In such a way, we find a number of new results for
 physically important two-loop two- and three-point
 Feynman diagrams. The results are presented in terms
 of generalized polylogarithmic functions.
