It<br>is regarded by many as the dreamed-of final theory and has accordingly<br>received an enormous amount of attention.  It is curious, therefore,<br>that two of the most basic questions of M-theory have until now remained<br>unanswered:<br><br>i) <i> What are the symmetries of M-theory?</i><br><br>ii) <i> How many supersymmetries can vacua of M-theory preserve?</i><br><br>The first purpose of this paper is to argue that M-theory possesses<br>previously unidentified hidden spacetime (timelike and null) symmetries in<br>addition to the well-known hidden internal (spacelike) symmetries.  These<br>take the form of generalized structure groups ${\cal G}$ that replace<br>the Lorentz group $\SO(10,1)$.<br><br>The second purpose is to argue that the number of supersymmetries<br>preserved by an M-theory vacuum is given by the number of singlets<br>appearing in the decomposition of the 32-dimensional representation of<br>${\cal G}$ under ${\cal G} \supset {\cal H}$ where ${\cal H}$ are<br>generalized holonomy groups.<br><br>The equations of M-theory display the<br>maximum number of supersymmetries $N$=32, and so $n$, the number of<br>supersymmetries preserved by a particular vacuum, must be some integer<br>between 0 and 32.  But are some values of $n$ forbidden and, if so,<br>which ones?  For quite some time it was widely believed that, aside<br>from the maximal $n=32$, $n$ is restricted to $0\leq n\leq 16$ with<br>$n=16$ being realized by the fundamental BPS objects of M-theory: the<br>M2-brane, the M5-brane, the M-wave and the M-monopole.  The subsequent<br>discovery of intersecting brane configurations with<br>$n=0$, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16 lent credence to this argument.  In<br><cite>Gauntletthull1</cite>, on the other hand, it was shown that all values<br>$0\leq n \leq 32$ are allowed by the M-theory algebra <cite>Townsend</cite>,<br>and examples of vacua with $16< n < 32$ have indeed since been found.<br>Following <cite>Duffstelle</cite> and <cite>Duff</cite>, we here<br>put forward a <i> generalized holonomy conjecture</i> according to<br>which the answer lies somewhere in between.  Evidence in favor of<br>this conjecture includes the observations that there are no known<br>counterexamples and that a previously undiscovered example predicted in<br><cite>Duff</cite>, namely $n$=14, has recently been found <cite>Harmark</cite>.<br><br>As we shall see, these conjectures are based on a group-theoretical argument<br>which applies to the fully-fledged M-theory.  To get the ball rolling,<br>however, we begin with the low energy limit of M-theory, namely $D=11$<br>supergravity.  The unique $D=11$ supermultiplet is comprised of<br>a graviton $g_{MN}$, a gravitino $\Psi_M$ and $3$-form gauge field<br>$A_{MNP}$, where $M=0, 1, \ldots 10$, with $44$, $128$ and $84$<br>physical degrees of freedom, respectively. In section \ref{hidden}, we<br>conjecture that the supergravity equations of motion for this set of<br>fields admit hidden timelike and null symmetries (in addition to<br>previously demonstrated hidden spacelike ones).  Then in section<br>\ref{holonomy} we demonstrate that, at least in the context of a<br>dimensionally reduced theory, the $D=11$ Killing spinor equation<br>indeed has such hidden symmetries.  This allows us to define a<br>generalized structure group and to analyze the number of<br>supersymmetries based on generalized holonomy.  We perform the latter<br>in section \ref{N}, and finally conclude in section \ref{M}.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br><h3>Hidden spacetime symmetries of D=11 supergravity</h3><br>\label{hidden}<br><br>Long ago, Cremmer and Julia <cite>Cremmerjulia</cite><br>pointed out that, when dimensionally reduced to $d$ dimensions, $D=11$<br>supergravity exhibits hidden symmetries.  For example ${\rm E}_7(global)<br>\times \SU(8)(local)$ when $d=4$ and $E_8(global) \times \SO(16)(local)$<br>when $d=3$.  The question was then posed <cite>Fradkin</cite>: do these<br>symmetries appear magically only after dimensional reduction, or were<br>they already present in the full uncompactified and untruncated $D=11$<br>theory?  The question was answered by de Wit and Nicolai<br><cite>Dewitnicolai2,Nicolai</cite> who made a $d/(11-d)$ split and fixed the<br>gauge by setting to zero the off-diagonal components of the elfbein.<br>They showed that in the resulting field equations the local symmetries<br>are indeed already present, but the global symmetries are not.  For<br>example, after making the split $\SO(10,1) \supset \SO(3,1) \times<br>\SO(7)$, we find the enlarged symmetry $\SO(3,1) \times \SU(8)$.  There<br>is no global ${\rm E}_7$ invariance (although the 70 internal components of<br>the metric and 3-form may nevertheless be assigned to an ${\rm E}_7/\SU(8)$<br>coset).  Similar results were found for other values of $d$: in each<br>case the internal subgroup $\SO(11-d)$ gets enlarged to some compact<br>group $G(spacelike)$ while the spacetime subgroup $\SO(d-1,1)$ remains<br>intact%<br>%<br>\footnote{We keep the terminology ``spacetime'' and ``internal''<br>even though no compactification or dimensional reduction is implied.}.<br>%<br>In this paper we ask instead whether there are hidden <i> spacetime</i><br>symmetries.  This is a question that could have been asked long ago,<br>but we suspect that people may have been inhibited by the<br>Coleman-Mandula theorem which forbids combining spacetime and internal<br>symmetries <cite>Coleman</cite>.  However, this is a statement about<br>Poincare symmetries of the S-matrix and here we are concerned<br>with Lorentz symmetries of the equations of motion, so there will be no<br>conflict.<br><br>The explicit demonstration of $G(spacelike)$ invariance by de Wit and<br>Nicolai is very involved, to say the least.  However, the result is<br>quite simple: one finds the same $G(spacelike)$ in the full<br>uncompactified $D=11$ theory as was already found in the spacelike<br>dimensional reduction of Cremmer and Julia.  Here we content ourselves<br>with the educated guess that the same logic applies to $G(timelike)$<br>and $G(null)$: they are the same as what one finds by timelike and<br>null reduction, respectively. So we propose<br>that, after making a $d/(11-d)$ split, the Lorentz subgroup<br>$G=\SO(d-1,1) \times \SO(11-d)$ can be enlarged to the<br>generalized structure groups ${\cal G}=\SO(d-1,1) \times<br>G(spacelike)$, ${\cal G}= \ISO(d-1) \times G(null)$ and ${\cal G}= SO(d)<br>\times G(timelike)$ as shown in Tables~\ref{sgen}, \ref{ngen}<br>and \ref{tgen}.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br>\begin{table}[t]<br>\begin{center}<br>\begin{tabular}{c|lc}<br>$d/(11-d)$&${\cal G}= \SO(d-1,1) \times G(spacelike)$&$\epsilon$ representation\\<br>\hline<br>10/1&$\SO(9,1) \times \{1\}$&$16+\overline{16}$\\<br>9/2&$\SO(8,1) \times \SO(2)$&$16_{\pm1/2}$\\<br>8/3&$\SO(7,1) \times \SO(3) \times \SO(2)$&$(8_s,2)_{1/2}+(8_c,2)_{-1/2}$\\<br>7/4&$\SO(6,1) \times \SO(5)$&$(8,4)$\\<br>6/5&$\SO(5,1) \times \SO(5) \times \SO(5)$&$(4,4,1)+(\overline{4},1,4)$\\<br>5/6&$\SO(4,1) \times {\rm USp}(8)$&$(4,8)$\\<br>4/7&$\SO(3,1) \times \SU(8)$&$(2,1,8)+(1,2,\overline{8})$\\<br>3/8&$\SO(2,1) \times \SO(16)$&$(2,16)$\\<br>\hline<br>2/9&$\SO(1,1) \times \SO(16) \times \SO(16)$&$(16,1)_{1/2}+(1,16)_{-1/2}$\\<br>1/10&$\{1\}   \times \SO(32)$&$32$<br>\end{tabular}<br>\end{center}<br>\caption{Generalized structure groups: spacelike case.

This<br>conjecture that these symmetries are present in the full theory and<br>not merely in its dimensional reductions may be put to the test,<br>however, as we shall later describe.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br><h3>Hidden Symmetries and Generalized Holonomy</h3><br>\label{holonomy}<br><br>We begin by reviewing the connection between holonomy and the number of<br>preserved supersymmetries, $n$, of supergravity vacua.  This also serves<br>to define our notation.  Subsequently, we introduce a generalized holonomy<br>which involves the hidden symmetries conjectured in the previous<br>section.<br><br>\subsection{Riemannian Holonomy}<br><br>We are interested in solutions of the bosonic field equations<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>R_{MN}=\frac{1}{12}\left(F_{MPQR}F_{N}{}^{PQR}-\frac{1}{12}g_{MN}<br>F^{PQRS}F_{PQRS}\right)<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>and<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>d*\!F_{(4)}+\fft12F_{(4)} \wedge F_{(4)}=0,<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>where $F_{(4)}=dA_{(3)}$.  The supersymmetry transformation rule of the<br>gravitino reduces in a purely bosonic background to<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>\delta \Psi_{M}={\tilde D}_{M} \epsilon,<br>\label{eq:11gto}<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>where the parameter $\epsilon$ is a 32-component anticommuting spinor,<br>and where<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>\label{covariant}<br>{\tilde D}_{M}=D_{M}-<br>\frac{1}{288}(\Gamma_M{}^{NPQR}-8\delta_M^N\Gamma^{PQR})F_{NPQR},<br>\label{supercovariant}<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>where $\Gamma^{A}$ are the $D=11$ Dirac matrices.  Here $D_{M}$ is the<br>usual Riemannian covariant derivative involving the connection $&#x03C9_{M}$<br>of the usual structure group $\Spin(10,1)$, the double cover of $\SO(10,1)$,<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>D_{M}=\partial_{M}+\frac{1}{4}&#x03C9_{M}{}^{AB}\Gamma_{AB}.<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>The number of supersymmetries preserved by an M-theory background depends<br>on the number of covariantly constant spinors,<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>{\tilde D}_{M}\epsilon=0,<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>called <i> Killing</i> spinors.  It is the presence of the terms involving<br>the 4-form $F_{(4)}$ in (\ref{covariant}) that makes this counting difficult, so<br>let us first examine the simpler vacua for which $F_{(4)}$ vanishes.<br>Killing spinors then satisfy the integrability condition<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>[{D}_{M}, {D}_{N}] \epsilon=\frac{1}{4}R_{MN}{}^{AB}\Gamma_{AB}\epsilon=0,<br>\label{integrability}<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>where $R_{MN}{}^{AB}$ is the Riemann tensor.  The subgroup of<br>$\Spin(10,1)$ generated by this linear combination of $\Spin(10,1)$ generators<br>$\Gamma_{AB}$ corresponds to the $<i> holonomy</i>$ group ${H}$ of the<br>connection $&#x03C9_{M}$.  The number of supersymmetries, $n$, is then<br>given by the number of singlets appearing in the decomposition of the<br>$32$ of $\Spin(1,10)$ under ${H}$.  In Euclidean signature, connections<br>satisfying (\ref{integrability}) are automatically Ricci-flat and<br>hence solve field equations when $F_{(4)}=0$.  In Lorentzian signature,<br>however, they need only be Ricci-null <cite>Fig</cite> so Ricci-flatness has<br>to be imposed as an extra condition.  In Euclidean signature, the<br>holonomy groups have been classified <cite>Berger</cite>.  In Lorentzian<br>signature, much less is known but the question of which subgroups ${H}$<br>of $\Spin(10,1)$ leave a spinor invariant has been answered in<br><cite>Bryant</cite>.  There are two sequences according as the vector<br>$v_{A}=\overline{\epsilon}\Gamma_{A}\epsilon$ is timelike or null, as shown<br>in Tables~\ref{static} and \ref{wave}. Since $v^{2} \leq 0$, the<br>spacelike $v_A$ case does not arise. The timelike $v_A$ case corresponds<br>to static vacua, where ${H} \subset \Spin(10) \subset \Spin(10,1)$ while<br>the null case to non-static vacua where ${H} \subset \ISO(9) \subset<br>\Spin(10,1)$.  It is then possible to determine the possible $n$-values<br><cite>Acharya:1998yv,Acharya:1998st</cite> and one finds $n=2$, 4, 6, 8,<br>16, 32 for static vacua, as shown in Table~\ref{static}, and $n=1$,<br>2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32 for non-static vacua, as shown in<br>Table~\ref{wave}.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br>\begin{table}[t]<br>\begin{center}<br>\begin{tabular}{c|cc}<br>$d/(11-d)$&$H \subset \SO(11-d)\subset\Spin(10)$& $n$\\<br>\hline<br>7/4&$\SU(2) \cong \Sp(2)$& $16$\\<br>5/6&$\SU(3)$& $8$\\<br>4/7&${\rm G}_2$& $4$\\<br>3/8&$\SU(2) \times \SU(2)$& $8$\\<br>&$\Sp(4)$& $6$\\<br>&$\SU(4)$& $4$\\<br>&$\Spin(7)$& $2$\\<br>1/10&$\SU(2) \times \SU(3)$& $4$\\<br>&$\SU(5)$& $2$<br>\end{tabular}<br>\end{center}<br>\caption{Holonomy of static M-theory vacua with $F_{(4)}=0$ and their<br>supersymmetries.}<br>\label{static}<br>\end{table}<br><br>\begin{table}[t]<br>\begin{center}<br>\begin{tabular}{c|cc}<br>$d/(11-d)$&$H \subset \ISO(d-1)\times\ISO(10-d)\subset\Spin(10,1)$& $n$\\<br>\hline<br>10/1&$\R^9$ & $16$\\<br>6/5&$\R^5\times(\SU(2) \ltimes \R^4)$ & $8$\\<br>4/7&$\R^3\times(\SU(3) \ltimes \R^6)$ & $4$\\<br>3/8&$\R^2\times({\rm G}_2 \ltimes \R^7)$ & $2$\\<br>2/9&$\R\times(\SU(2) \ltimes \R^4) \times (\SU(2) \ltimes \R^4)$ & $4$\\<br>&$\R\times(\Sp(4) \ltimes \R^8)$ & $3$\\<br>&$\R\times(\SU(4) \ltimes \R^8)$ & $2$\\<br>&$\R\times(\Spin(7) \ltimes \R^8)$ & $1$<br>\end{tabular}<br>\end{center}<br>\caption{Holonomy of non-static M-theory vacua with $F_{(4)}=0$ and their<br>supersymmetries.}<br>\label{wave}<br>\end{table}<br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>\subsection{Generalized holonomy}<br>\label{genhol}<br><br>When we want to include vacua with $F_{(4)}\neq 0$ we face the problem<br>that the connection in (\ref{covariant}) is no longer the spin<br>connection to which the bulk of the mathematical literature on<br>holonomy groups is devoted.  In addition to the $\Spin (10,1)$<br>generators $\Gamma_{AB}$, it is apparent from (\ref{supercovariant})<br>that there are terms involving $\Gamma_{ABC}$ and $\Gamma_{ABCDE}$.<br>As a result, the connection takes its values in the full $D=11$<br>Clifford algebra.  Moreover, this connection can preserve exotic<br>fractions of supersymmetry forbidden by the Riemannian connection.<br>For example, the M-branes at angles in <cite>Ohta</cite> include $n$=5, the<br>11-dimensional pp-waves in<br><cite>Michelson,Cvetic:2002si,Gauntletthull2,Bena</cite> include $n=18$, 20,<br>22, 24, 26 (and $n=28$ for Type IIB), the squashed $N(1,1)$ spaces in<br><cite>Page</cite> and the M5-branes in a pp-wave background in <cite>Singh</cite><br>include $n$=12 and the G\"{o}del universes in <cite>Gauntlett:2002nw</cite><br>include $n=18$, 20, 22, 24.<br><br>However, we can attempt to quantify this in terms of generalized<br>holonomy groups ${\cal H} \subset {\cal G}$ where ${\cal G}$ are<br>the generalized structure groups discussed in section \ref{hidden}.<br>The generalized holonomy conjecture<br><cite>Duffstelle,Duff</cite> states that one can assign a holonomy ${\cal H}<br>\subset {\cal G}$ to the generalized connection%<br>%<br>\footnote{A related conjecture was made in <cite>Berkooz</cite>, where the<br>generalized holonomy could be any subgroup of $\SO(16,16)$.

In this case, a standard<br>dimensional reduction of the $D=11$ gravitino transformation,<br>(\ref{eq:11gto}), yields the $d$-dimensional gravitino transformation<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>\delta\psi_\mu=[D_\mu+\ft14Q_\mu{}^{ab}\Gamma_{ab}+\ft1{24}\partial_\mu<br>\phi_{ijk}\Gamma^{ijk}]\epsilon.<br>\label{eq:dgto}<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>For completeness, we also note that the $d$-dimensional dilatinos<br>transform according to<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>\delta\lambda_i=-\ft12\gamma^\mu[P_{\mu\,ij}\Gamma^j<br>-\ft1{36}(\Gamma_i{}^{jkl}-6\delta_i^j\Gamma^{kl})\partial_\mu\phi_{jkl}]<br>\epsilon.<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>In the above, the lower dimensional quantities are related to their $D=11$<br>counterparts through<br>%<br>\begin{eqnarray}<br>&&\psi_\mu=\Delta^{\fft1{4(d-2)}}\left(\Psi^{(11)}_\mu+\fft1{d-2}\gamma_\mu<br>\Gamma^i\Psi^{(11)}_i\right),\qquad<br>\lambda_i=\Delta^{\fft1{4(d-2)}}\Psi^{(11)}_i,\nonumber\\<br>&&\epsilon=\Delta^{\fft1{4(d-2)}}\epsilon^{(11)},\nonumber\\<br>&&Q^{ab}_\mu=e^{i[a}\partial_\mu e_i{}^{b]},\qquad<br>P_{\mu\,ij}=e_{(i}^a\partial_\mu e_{j)\,a}.<br>\end{eqnarray}<br>%<br><br>We now see that the lower dimensional gravitino transformation,<br>(\ref{eq:dgto}), may be written in terms of a covariant derivative<br>under a generalized connection<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>\delta\psi_\mu=\hat D_\mu\epsilon,\qquad<br>\hat D_\mu=\partial_\mu+\ft14\Omega_\mu,<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>where<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>\Omega_\mu=&#x03C9_\mu{}^{&#x03B1\beta}\gamma_{&#x03B1\beta}<br>+Q_\mu{}^{ab}\Gamma_{ab}+\ft1{3!}e^{ia}e^{jb}e^{kc}\partial_\mu\phi_{ijk}<br>\Gamma_{abc}.<br>\label{eq:gencon}<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>Here $\gamma_&#x03B1$ are $\SO(d-1,1)$ Dirac matrices, while $\Gamma_a$<br>are $\SO(11-d)$ Dirac matrices.  This decomposition is suggestive of a<br>generalized structure group with connection given by $\Omega_\mu$.<br>However one additional requirement is necessary before declaring this an<br>enlargement of $\SO(d-1,1)\times \SO(11-d)$, and that is to ensure that the<br>algebra generated by $\Gamma_{ab}$ and $\Gamma_{abc}$ closes within<br>itself.  Along this line, we note that the commutators of these internal<br>Dirac matrices have the schematic structure<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>[\Gamma^{(2)},\Gamma^{(2)}]=\Gamma^{(2)},\qquad<br>[\Gamma^{(2)},\Gamma^{(3)}]=\Gamma^{(3)},\qquad<br>[\Gamma^{(3)},\Gamma^{(3)}]=\Gamma^{(6)}+\Gamma^{(2)}.<br>\label{eq:diralg}<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>Here the notation $\Gamma^{(n)}$ indicates the antisymmetric product of<br>$n$ Dirac matrices, and the right hand sides of the commutators only<br>indicate what possible terms may show up.  The first commutator above<br>merely indicates that the $\Gamma_{ab}$ matrices provide a<br>representation of the Riemannian $\SO(11-d)$ structure group.<br><br>For $d\ge6$, the internal space is restricted to five or fewer<br>dimensions.  In this case, the antisymmetric product $\Gamma^{(6)}$<br>cannot show up, and the algebra clearly closes on $\Gamma^{(2)}$ and<br>$\Gamma^{(3)}$.  Working out the extended structure groups for these<br>cases results in the expected Cremmer and Julia groups listed in the<br>first four lines of Table~\ref{sgen}.  A similar analysis follows for<br>$d\le5$.  However, in this case, we must also dualize an additional set<br>of fields to see the hidden symmetries.  For $d=5$, an additional scalar<br>arises from the dual of $F_{\mu\nu&#x03C1\sigma}$; this yields an addition<br>to (\ref{eq:gencon}) of the form $\Omega_\mu^{\rm additional}=\fft1{4!}<br>\epsilon_\mu{}^{\nu&#x03C1\sigma\lambda} F_{\mu\nu&#x03C1\sigma}\Gamma_{123456}$.<br>This $\Gamma^{(6)}$ term is precisely what is necessary for the closure<br>of the algebra of (\ref{eq:diralg}).  Of course, in this case, we must<br>also make note of the additional commutators<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>[\Gamma^{(2)},\Gamma^{(6)}]=\Gamma^{(6)},\qquad<br>[\Gamma^{(3)},\Gamma^{(6)}]=\Gamma^{(7)}+\Gamma^{(3)},\qquad<br>[\Gamma^{(6)},\Gamma^{(6)}]=\Gamma^{(10)}+\Gamma^{(6)}+\Gamma^{(2)}.<br>\label{eq:gam6com}<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>However neither $\Gamma^{(7)}$ nor $\Gamma^{(10)}$ may show up in $d=5$ for<br>dimensional reasons.<br><br>The analysis for $d=4$ is similar; however here<br>$\Omega_\mu^{\rm<br>additional}=\fft1{3!}\epsilon_\mu{}^{\nu&#x03C1\sigma}e^{ia}F_{\nu&#x03C1\sigma i}<br>\Gamma_a\Gamma_{1234567}$.  Closure of the algebra on $\Gamma^{(2)}$,<br>$\Gamma^{(3)}$ and $\Gamma^{(6)}$ then follows because, while $\Gamma^{(7)}$<br>may in principle arise in the middle commutator of (\ref{eq:gam6com}),<br>it turns out to be kinematically forbidden.  For $d=3$, on the other<br>hand, in additional to a contribution $\Omega_\mu^{\rm additional}<br>=\fft1{2!\cdot2!}\epsilon_\mu{}^{\nu&#x03C1}e^{ia}e^{jb}F_{\nu&#x03C1 ij}<br>\Gamma_{ab}\Gamma_{12345678}$, one must also dualize the Kaluza-Klein<br>vectors $g_\mu{}^i$.  Doing so gives rise to a $\Gamma^{(7)}$ in the<br>generalized connection which, in addition to the previously identified<br>terms, completes the internal structure group to $\SO(16)$.<br><br>The remaining two cases, namely $d=2$ and $d=1$, fall somewhat outside the<br>framework presented above.  This is because in these low dimensions the<br>generalized connections $\Omega_\mu$ derived via reduction are partially<br>incomplete.  For $d=2$, we find<br>%<br>\begin{equation}<br>\Omega_\mu^{(d=2)}=&#x03C9_\mu{}^{&#x03B1\beta}<br>\gamma_{&#x03B1\beta}+Q_\mu{}^{ab}\Gamma_{ab}+\ft19(\delta_\mu^\nu-<br>\ft12\gamma_\mu{}^\nu)e^{ia}e^{jb}e^{kc}\partial_\nu\phi_{ijk}\Gamma_{abc},<br>\label{eq:d2omega}<br>\end{equation}<br>%<br>where $\gamma_{\mu\nu}=-\fft12\epsilon_{\mu\nu}<br>(\epsilon^{&#x03B1\beta}\gamma_{&#x03B1\beta})$ is necessarily proportional<br>to the two-dimensional chirality matrix.  Hence from a two-dimensional<br>point of view, the scalars from the metric enter non-chirally, while the<br>scalars from $F_{(4)}$ enter chirally.  Taken together, the generalized<br>connection (\ref{eq:d2omega}) takes values in $\SO(16)_+\times<br>\SO(16)_-$, which we regard as the enlarged structure group.  However not<br>all generators are present because of lack of chirality in<br>the term proportional to $Q_\mu{}^{ab}$.  Thus at this point the<br>generalized structure group deviates from the hidden symmetry group,<br>which would be an infinite dimensional subgroup of affine ${\rm E}_8$.<br>Similarly, for $d=1$, closure of the connection $\Omega_\mu^{(d=1)}$<br>results in an enlarged $\SO(32)$ structure group.  However this is not<br>obviously related to any actual hidden symmetry of the $1/10$ split.<br><br>Until now, we have considered the spacelike reductions leading to the<br>generalized structure groups of Table~\ref{sgen}.  For a timelike<br>reduction, we simply interchange a time and a space direction in the<br>above analysis%<br>%<br>\footnote{By postulating that the generalized structure groups survive as<br>hidden symmetries of the full uncompactified theory, we avoid the undesirable<br>features associated with compactifications including a timelike direction<br>such as closed timelike curves.}.<br>%<br>This results in an internal Clifford algebra with signature $(10-d,1)$,<br>and yields the extended symmetry groups indicated in Table~\ref{tgen}.<br>Turning finally to the null case, we may replace one of the internal<br>Dirac matrices with $\Gamma_+$ (where $+$, $-$ denote light-cone<br>directions).  Since $(\Gamma_+)^2=0$, this indicates that the extended<br>structure groups for the null case are contractions the corresponding<br>spacelike (or timelike) groups.  In addition, by removing $\Gamma_+$<br>from the set of Dirac matrices, we essentially end up in the case of one<br>fewer compactified dimensions.  As a result, the $G(null)$ group in<br>$d$-dimensions must have a semi-direct product structure involving the<br>$G(spacelike)$ group in $(d+1)$-dimensions.  Of course, these groups<br>also contain the original $\ISO(10-d)$ structure group as a subgroup.<br>The resulting generalized structure groups are given in<br>Table~\ref{ngen}%<br>%<br>\footnote{The reduction of $D$-dimensional pure gravity along a single<br>null direction was analyzed by Julia and Nicolai <cite>Julianicolai</cite>.}.<br>%<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br>\newpage %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br><h3>Counting supersymmetries</h3><br>\label{N}<br><br>Having defined a generalized holonomy for vacua with $F_{(4)}\ne0$, we<br>now turn to some elementary examples.  For the basic objects of<br>M-theory, the M2-brane configuration falls under the 3/8 (spacelike)<br>classification, and has generalized holonomy $\SO(8)$ contained in<br>$\SO(2,1)\times\SO(16)$ <cite>Duffstelle</cite>.  In this case, the spinor<br>decomposes as<br>$(2,16)=2(8)+16(1)$, indicating the expected presence of 16 singlets.<br>For the M5-brane with 6/5 (spacelike) split, the generalized holonomy is<br>given by $\SO(5)_+\subset \SO(5,1)\times\SO(5)_+\times\SO(5)_-$, with<br>the spinor decomposition $(4,4,1)+(\overline{4},1,4)=4(4)+16(1)$.  Since<br>the wave solution depends on nine space-like coordinates, we may regard<br>it as a 1/10 (null) split.  In this case, it has holonomy<br>$\R^{9}\subset [\SO(16)\times\SO(16)]\ltimes \R^{256}_{(16,16)}$.  The<br>spinor again decomposes into 16 singlets.  Note, however, that since<br>the wave is pure geometry, it could equally well be categorized under a<br>10/1 split as $\R^9\subset \ISO(9)$.  Finally, the KK monopole<br>is described by a 7/4 (spacelike) split, and has generalized holonomy<br>$SU(2)_+ \subset \SO(6,1)\times\SO(5)$, where the spinor decomposes as<br>$(8,4)=8(2)+16(1)$.  In all four cases, the individual objects<br>preserve exactly half of the 32 supersymmetries.  However each object<br>is associated with its own unique generalized holonomy, namely<br>$\SO(8)$, $\SO(5)$, $\R^{9}$ and $\SU(2)$ for the M2, M5, MW and MK,<br>respectively.<br><br>The supersymmetry of intersecting brane configurations may be understood<br>in a similar manner based on generalized holonomy.  For example, for a<br>M5 and MK configuration sharing six longitudinal directions, we may<br>choose a 6/5 split.  In this case, the structure group is<br>$\SO(5,1)\times \SO(5)_+\times \SO(5)_-$, and the holonomies of the<br>individual objects are $\SO(5)_+$ and $\SU(2)\subset\SO(5)_{\rm diag}$,<br>respectively.  The holonomy for the combined configuration turns out to<br>be $\SO(5)_+\times\SU(2)_-$, with the spinor decomposing as<br>$(4,4,1)+(\overline{4},1,4)=4(4,1)+4(1,2)+8(1,1)$.  The resulting eight<br>singlets then signify the presence of a $1/4$ supersymmetric configuration.<br>In principle, this analysis may be applied to more general brane<br>configurations.  However one goal of understanding enlarged holonomy is<br>to obtain a classification of allowed holonomy groups and, as a result, to<br>obtain a unified treatment of counting supersymmetries.  We now provide<br>some observations along this direction.<br><br>We first note the elementary fact that a $p$-dimensional representation<br>can decompose into any number of singlets between 0 and $p$, <i>
except</i> $(p-1)$, since if we have $(p-1)$ singlets, we must have $p$.<br>It follows that in theories with $N$ supersymmetries, $n=N-1$<br>is ruled out, even though it is permitted by the supersymmetry algebra.<br><br>It follows that if the supersymmetry charge transforms<br>as the $(2,16)$ representation of the ${\cal G}$ when $d=3$,<br>then $n$ is restricted to 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24,<br>26, 28, 32 as first noted in <cite>Duff</cite>.  No new values of $n$ are generated<br>by $d>3$ reps.  For example, the 4 of $\SO(5)$ can decompose only into<br>0, 2 or 4 singlets but not 1.<br><br>We note that all the even values of $n$ discussed so far appear in the<br>list and that $n=30$ is absent.  This is consistent with the presence of<br>pp-waves with $n=16$, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 (and $n=28$ for Type IIB) but the<br>absence of $n$=30 noted in<br><cite>Bena,Michelson,Cvetic:2002si,Gauntletthull2</cite>.  Of course a good<br>conjecture should not only account for the existing data but should go<br>on to predict something new.  For example, Gell-Mann's flavor $\SU(3)$<br>not only accounted for the nine known members of the baryon decuplet<br>but went on to predict the existence of the $\Omega^{-}$, which was<br>subsequently discovered experimentally.  For M-theory supersymmetries,<br>the role of the $\Omega^{-}$ is played by $n=14$ which at the time of<br>its prediction had not been discovered ``experimentally''.  We note<br>with satisfaction, therefore, that this missing member has recently been<br>found in the form of a G\"{o}del universe <cite>Harmark</cite>.<br><br>The $d=2$ and $d=1$ cases are more problematic since $\SO(16)\times\SO(16)$<br>and $\SO(32)$ in principle allow any $n$ except $n=31$.  So more work is<br>required to explain the presence of M-branes at angles with $n=0$, 1,<br>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16 but the absence of $n=7$ noted in <cite>Ohta</cite>.<br>Presumably, a more detailed analysis will show that only those<br>subgroups compatible with these allowed values of $n$ actually appear as<br>generalized holonomy groups.  The beginnings of a classification of<br>all supersymmetric $D=11$ solutions may be found in <cite>Gauntlett:2002fz</cite>.<br><br>We can apply similar logic to theories with fewer than 32<br>supersymmetries.  Of course, if M-theory really underlies all<br>supersymmetric theories then the corresponding vacua will all be<br>special cases of the above.  However, it is sometimes useful to focus<br>on such a sub-theory, for example the Type I and heterotic strings<br>with $N=16$.  Here $G(spacelike)= \SO(d) \times \SO(d)$, $G(null)=<br>\ISO(d-1) \times \ISO(d-1)$ and $G(timelike)=\SO(d-1,1) \times<br>\SO(d-1,1)$.  If the supersymmetry charge transforms as a $(2,8)$<br>representation of the generalized structure group when $d=3$, then $n$<br>is restricted to 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16.  No new values of $n$ are<br>generated from other $d>4$ reps. Once again, the $d=2$ and $d=1$ cases<br>require a more detailed analysis.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br><h3>The full M-theory</h3><br>\label{M}<br><br>We have focused on the low energy limit of M-theory, but<br>since the reasoning that led to the conjecture is based just on group<br>theory, it seems reasonable to promote it to the full<br>M-theory%<br>%<br>\footnote{Similar conjectures can be applied to M-theory in signatures<br>(9,2) and (6,5) <cite>Blencowe:1988sk</cite>, the so-called M' and M*<br>theories <cite>Hull:1998ym</cite>, but the groups will be different.}.<br>%<br>When counting the $n$ value of a particular vacuum, however, we should be<br>careful to note the phenomenon of <i> supersymmetry without
supersymmetry</i>, where the supergravity approximation may fail to<br>capture the full supersymmetry of an M-theory vacuum. For example,<br>vacua related by T-duality and S-duality must, by definition, have the<br>same $n$ values. Yet they can appear to be different in<br>supergravity <cite>DLP1,DLP2</cite>, if one fails to take into account winding<br>modes and non-perturbative solitons. So more work is needed to verify<br>that the $n$ values found so far in $D=11$ supergravity exhaust those of<br>M-theory, and to prove or disprove the conjecture.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>\section*{Acknowledgments}<br><br>We have enjoyed useful conversations with Hisham Sati.<br><br>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<br><br>\begin{thebibliography}{00}<br><br>\bibitem{World}<br>For a review, see M.

Extra reference. 16 pages, latex Report-no: MCTP-03-11<br><br>       In M-theory vacua with vanishing 4-form F, one can invoke the<br>       ordinary Riemannian holonomy H \subset SO(1,10) to account for<br>       unbroken supersymmetries n=1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32. However,<br>       the generalized holonomy conjecture, valid for non-zero F, can<br>       account for more exotic fractions of supersymmetry, in<br>       particular 16<n<32. The conjectured holonomies are given by H<br>       \subset G where G are the generalized structure groups G=SO(d-1,1)<br>       x G(spacelike), G=ISO(d-1) x G(null) and G=SO(d) x G(timelike)<br>       with 1<=d<11. For example, G(spacelike)=SO(16), G(null)=[SU(8)<br>       x U(1)] \ltimes R^{56} and G(timelike)=SO*(16) when d=3. Although<br>       extending spacetime symmetries, there is no conflict with the<br>       Coleman-Mandula theorem. The holonomy conjecture rules out certain<br>       vacua which are otherwise permitted by the supersymmetry algebra.<br><br>
