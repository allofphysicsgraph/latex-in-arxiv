We present a method for
evaluating divergent
non-Borel-summable
 series
by
 an analytic continuation
 of variational perturbation
 theory. We demonstrate the power of the method
by an application to the exactly known partition function
of the anharmonic oscillator
in zero space-time dimensions.
In one space-time dimension
we
derive
the imaginary part of the
 ground state energy of
 the anharmonic oscillator for {\em all\/} negative
 values of
 the coupling constant $g$, including the
non-analytic tunneling regime at
small $-g$.
As a
highlight
 of the theory
we retrieve
 the divergent
perturbation expansion from
the  action
of the critical bubble
and the contribution
of the higher  loop
fluctuations around the bubble.
