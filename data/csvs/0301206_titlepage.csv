\noindent 
Supersymmetric backgrounds in string and M-theory 
of the G\""{o}del  Universe type are studied. 
We find several new G\""{o}del  Universes that 
preserve up to 20 supersymmetries.
In particular, we obtain an interesting G\""{o}del  Universe in M-theory with 18 
supersymmetries
which does not seem to be dual to a pp-wave.
We show that not only T-duality but also the 
type-IIA/M-theory 
S-duality can give supersymmetric G\""{o}del  Universes from pp-waves.
We find solutions that can interpolate between G\""{o}del 
Universes and pp-waves.
We also compute
the string spectrum on two type IIA G\""{o}del  Universes. Furthermore, we  
obtain
the spectrum of D-branes on a G\""{o}del  Universe and find
the supergravity solution for a D4-brane on a G\""{o}del  Universe.
