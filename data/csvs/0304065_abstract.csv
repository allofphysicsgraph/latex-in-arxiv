Gauge fields are special in the sense that they are invariant under gauge
transformations and \emph{``ipso facto''} they lead to problems when we try
quantizing them straightforwardly. To circumvent this problem we need to
specify a gauge condition to fix the gauge so that the fields that are
connected by gauge invariance are not overcounted in the process of
quantization. The usual way we do this in the light-front is through the
introduction of a Lagrange multiplier, $(n\cdot A)^{2}$, where $n_{\mu }$ is
the external light-like vector, i.e., $n^{2}=0$, and $A_{\mu }$ is the
vector potential. This leads to the usual light-front propagator with all
the ensuing characteristics such as the prominent $(k\cdot n)^{-1}$ pole
which has been the subject of much research. However, it has been for long
recognized that this procedure is incomplete in that there remains a
residual gauge freedom still to be fixed by some ``ad hoc'' prescription,
and this is normally worked out to remedy some unwieldy aspect that emerges
along the way. In this work we propose \emph{two} Lagrange multipliers with
distinct coefficients for the light-front gauge that leads to the correctly
defined propagator with no residual gauge freedom left. This is accomplished
via $(n\cdot A)^2+(\partial \cdot A)^2$ terms in the Lagrangian density.
These lead to a well-defined and exact though Lorentz non invariant
propagator.
