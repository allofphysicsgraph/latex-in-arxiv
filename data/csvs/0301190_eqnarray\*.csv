M=\frac{3B^{2}}{8Gl^{2}}(1+\nu )\;.  \label{BH-Mass}
\end{equation}
This result coincides with the expression (\ref{Canonical Charges}) obtained
from the Hamiltonian formalism for $\xi =\partial _{t}$, \textit{i.e.}, $%
Q(\partial _{t})=M$.

\subsection{New solutions}

For the range $\nu \leq 0$, an independent static circularly symmetric
solution with a nontrivial scalar field exists\footnote{%
In the conformal frame \cite{HMTZ}, this solution corresponds to a massless
BTZ black hole dressed with a scalar field given by $\hat{\phi}=\sqrt{\frac{B%
}{r+B\sqrt{-\nu }}}$, which for $\nu <0$ is regular everywhere. For the case 
$\nu =0$ \cite{Natsuume:1999cd, Ayon-Beato:2001sb}, the scalar field
diverges at the origin.}. The scalar field is given by

\begin{equation}
\phi =\textrm{arctanh}\left( \sqrt{\frac{B}{f(r)+B\sqrt{-\nu }}}\right) \;,
\label{PhiNS}
\end{equation}
with

\begin{equation}
f(r)=\frac{1}{2}\left( r-B(\sqrt{-\nu }-1)+\sqrt{\left( r-B\left( \sqrt{-\nu 
}-1\right) \right) ^{2}+4B\sqrt{-\nu }r}\right) \;,  \label{f}
\end{equation}
so that $\alpha $ in Eq. (\ref{AsymptPhi}) differs from $-\frac{2}{3}$,  
the value it attains in the black hole case, but now depends on the parameter $\nu $:
\[
\alpha =-\frac{1+3\sqrt{-\nu }}{6}\;.
\]
The metric is given by

\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=-\frac{r^{2}}{l^{2}}dt^{2}+\frac{l^{2}(f+B(\sqrt{-\nu }-1))^{2}(f+B%
\sqrt{-\nu })^{2}}{f^{2}(f^{2}-B(B-2f)\sqrt{-\nu }-B^{2}\nu )^{2}}%
dr^{2}+r^{2}d\varphi ^{2}\;,  \label{NS}
\end{equation}
with asymptotic behavior of the form (\ref{AsymptGeneral}). The
integration constant $B$ is nonnegative, and for $B=0$, this solution
reduces to the massless BTZ black hole with $\phi =0$. The geometric
behavior of (\ref{NS}) radically varies, depending on the range of the
parameter $\nu $.

\subsubsection{The Nullnut} \label{nullnutsec}

For the range $\nu <-1$, the potential looks like a ``Mexican hat''. In this
case, the scalar field (\ref{PhiNS}) is regular everywhere, and the metric (%
\ref{NS}) possesses a timelike killing vector whose norm vanishes at $r=0$.
Note that, under a suitable time rescaling, the line element around $r=0$
can be written as a massless BTZ black hole with an effective AdS radius $%
\tilde{l}=l\frac{\sqrt{-\nu }-1}{\sqrt{-\nu }}$, 
\[
ds_{r\rightarrow 0}^{2}=-\frac{r^{2}}{\tilde{l}^{2}}dt^{2}+\frac{\tilde{l}%
^{2}}{r^{2}}dr^{2}+r^{2}d\varphi ^{2}\;,
\]
This means that the geometry is smooth, as can be seen from the behavior of
the Ricci scalar near the origin 
\[
R_{r\rightarrow 0}=-\frac{6}{\tilde{l}^{2}}+O(r^{2})\;.
\]
This geometry has been dubbed ``nullnut'' because it has a nut  on the null
curve $r=0$. Its causal structure is the same as for the massless BTZ black
hole, irrespective of the value of the integration constant $B$. As can be
foreseen through the invariance under boosts in the $t-\varphi $ plane, this
solution, independently of the integration constant $B$, has a vanishing
mass. This can be explicitly checked from the quasilocal stress-energy
tensor (\ref{Tmn}) by choosing $u^{\mu }=\frac{1}{N_{\Sigma }}\delta
_{t}^{\mu }$ in the surface integral (\ref{Mg+Mphi}). In this case, the
contribution coming from the matter piece, 
\[
M_{\phi }=\frac{Br}{2l^{2}}+\frac{B^{2}(1-3\sqrt{-\nu })}{4l^{2}}\;,
\]
is exactly cancelled by the contribution of the gravitational sector, that
is, $M_{G}=-M_{\phi }$, yielding zero total mass. Owing to this
fact, these configuration can be regarded as a sort of degenerate ground
state.

For the range $-1\leq \nu \leq 0$, the metric (\ref{NS}) describes a
different geometry, because it has what we consider to be a mild naked
singularity at $r=0$, since its mass vanishes, and it has a finite Euclidean
action.

\section{Thermodynamics from the Euclidean action} \label{4}

Since our action (\ref{ITotal}) has been regularized by the presence of the
counterterm (\ref{Ict}), in the semiclassical approximation the partition
function is determined by the exponential of the Euclidean action, $Z=\exp
(I)$, evaluated on the classical solution, without the need of a background
substraction.

Hence, the thermodynamics for the scalar black hole (\ref{Scalar},\ref{The
metric}) can be read from the Euclidean action evaluated on the Wick-rotated
solution.

On shell, the bulk term reduces to 
\begin{eqnarray*}
I_{Bulk} &=&\frac{2}{\pi G}\int_{M}d^{3}x\sqrt{g}V(\phi ) \\
&=&-\frac{\beta }{2Gl^{2}}\lim_{r_{0}\rightarrow \infty
}\int_{r_{+}}^{r_{0}}dr\frac{r\left[ (H+B)^{3}+\nu B^{3}\right] }{H^{2}(H+2B)%
} \\
&=&-\frac{\beta }{4Gl^{2}}[r_{0}^{2}+2Br_{0}-B^{2}(5+3\nu )]\;,
\end{eqnarray*}
and, when the cut-off $r_{0}\rightarrow \infty $, the surface terms read

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{8\pi G}\int_{\partial M}d^{2}x\sqrt{\gamma }\Theta &=&\frac{\beta }{%
4Gl^{2}}\left[ 2r_{0}^{2}+4Br_{0}-B^{2}(7+3\nu )\right] \;, \\
\frac{1}{8\pi G}\int_{\partial M}d^{2}x\frac{\sqrt{\gamma }}{l} &=&\frac{%
\beta }{4Gl^{2}}\left[ r_{0}^{2}-\frac{3}{2}B^{2}(1+\nu )\right] \;, \\
\frac{1}{8\pi Gl}\int_{\partial M}d^{2}x\;\sqrt{-\gamma }\left( 2l\;\phi 
\hat{\eta}^{M}\partial _{M}\phi -\phi ^{2}\right) &=&\frac{\beta }{4Gl^{2}}%
\left[ 2B^{2}-2Br_{0}\right] \;.
\end{eqnarray*}
As the scalar black hole solution, described by (\ref{Scalar})
and (\ref{The metric}), has an inverse Hawking temperature given by 
\begin{equation}
\beta =\frac{2\pi l^{2}}{3B}\frac{\Theta _{\nu }}{(1+\nu )}\;,
\label{Temperature}
\end{equation}
the Euclidean action is 
\begin{equation}
I=-\beta F=\frac{\pi \Theta _{\nu }}{4G}B\;,  \label{Ie}
\end{equation}
and consequently, the counterterm prescription reproduces the expected
thermodynamic expression for the free energy. Indeed, the mass in Eq.(\ref
{BH-Mass}) and the entropy are recovered from (\ref{Ie}) through 
\begin{eqnarray*}
M &=&-\frac{\partial I}{\partial \beta }=\frac{3B^{2}}{8Gl^{2}}(1+\nu )\;, \\
S &=&(1-\beta \frac{\partial }{\partial \beta })I=\frac{\pi r_{+}}{2G}=\frac{%
A}{4G}\;.
\end{eqnarray*}

An analogous computation shows that, for the nullnut solution given by (\ref{PhiNS})
and (\ref{NS})  with $\nu <-1$, the Euclidean action vanishes. This
is consistent with the fact that the nullnut has vanishing mass and
temperature, as well as a null entropy.

\subsection{Thermal Decay}

Note that the specific heat of the scalar black hole is given by $C=\partial
M/\partial T=\frac{\pi }{2}r_{+}$, which is always positive. This means that
the scalar black hole can always reach thermal equilibrium with a heat bath.
However, for a fixed temperature, apart from the scalar black hole (SBH), a
BTZ black hole with a vanishing scalar field can also be at equilibrium with
the heat bath. This raises the question of whether the scalar black
hole could decay into the BTZ black hole. To examine this question, one
needs to evaluate the difference between their respective free energies.

As both geometries approach AdS at infinity, the matching of the
temperatures leads to the following relationship between both horizon radii:
\[
r_{+}^{SBH}=\frac{\Theta _{\nu }^{2}}{3(1+\nu )}r_{+}^{BTZ}\;.
\]
The action for the scalar black hole is given by (\ref{Ie}), and the action
for BTZ can be readily obtained in the same way: $I_{BTZ}=\pi
r_{+}^{_{BTZ}}/{4G}$. Therefore their difference 
\[
I_{SBH}-I_{BTZ}=\frac{\pi }{4G}\left[ \Theta _{\nu }-\frac{3(1+\nu )}{\Theta
_{\nu }}\right] B\;,
\]
which is always negative since $\Theta _{\nu }-\frac{3(1+\nu )}{\Theta _{\nu
}}<0$ for the range $\nu >-1$. This means that there is a nonvanishing
probability for the decay of a scalar black hole into the BTZ black hole,
induced by the thermal fluctuations, irrespective of the value of the
horizon radius. Furthermore, since

\[
\frac{M_{SBH}}{M_{BTZ}}=\frac{S_{SBH}}{S_{BTZ}}=\frac{\Theta _{\nu }^{2}}{%
3(1+\nu )}<1\;,
\]
in the decay process, the scalar black hole absorbs energy from the thermal
bath, thus increasing its horizon radius, and consequently its entropy. This
suggests that in this process, the scalar field is, in some sense, absorbed
by the black hole.

Analogously, since the nullnut solution, given by (\ref{PhiNS}) and (\ref{NS}%
), has vanishing temperature and action, there is probability of decaying
into a BTZ black hole. Hence, in a similar way, the nullnut would be able to
absorb its own scalar field.

\subsection{Central charge}

Note that, even though the fall-off of the fields at infinity, given by 
(\ref{AsymptPhi}) and (\ref{AsymptGeneral}), is slower than that of a localized
distribution of matter, this set of conditions is also left invariant under
the Virasoro algebra generated by (\ref{AsymptKillingVectors}). Moreover,
although the expression for canonical charges differs form the one found in 
\cite{Brown-Henneaux}, it was shown in \cite{HMTZ} that their algebra is
identical, i.e., two copies of the Virasoro algebra with exactly the same
central extension. This follows from the results of Ref. \cite
{Brown:ed}, which states that the bracket of two charges provides a
realization of the asymptotic symmetry algebra with a possible central
extension. For the class of potentials which are consistent with the
modified asymptotic behavior (\ref{AsymptPhi}) and (\ref{AsymptGeneral}), the
massless BTZ black hole with vanishing scalar field corresponds to the
ground state. Thus, the central charge can be determined by computing the
variation of the charges on the vacuum. It is simple to check that the same
result is obtained for the nullnut solution given in Sec. \ref{nullnutsec}.

The purpose of this section is to show that the central charge can also be
obtained in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence.  The latter associates 
the Brown-York quasilocal stress-energy tensor $T^{\mu \nu }$
with the stress-energy tensor of a conformal field theory
living at the spacetime boundary. For the three-dimensional cases considered
here, the boundary metric is conformal to a flat cylinder, i.e., $%
ds^{2}=-\frac{dt^{2}}{l^{2}}+d\varphi ^{2}=-dx^{+}dx^{-}$, with $x^{\pm }=%
\frac{t}{l}\pm \varphi $. It is well known that under diffeomorphisms of the
form 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{+} &\rightarrow &x^{+}-\xi ^{+}(x^{+})\;, \\
x^{-} &\rightarrow &x^{-}-\xi ^{-}(x^{-})\;,
\end{eqnarray*}
the $T_{++}$ component of the stress-energy tensor for a two-dimensional CFT
transforms as 
\begin{equation}
\delta _{\xi }T_{++}=(2\partial _{+}\xi ^{+}T_{++}+\xi ^{+}\partial
_{+}T_{++})-\frac{c}{24\pi }\partial _{+}^{3}\xi ^{+}\;,  \label{DeltaTmnCFT}
\end{equation}
where the last term is the quantum anomaly. Hence, the central charge $c$
can be obtained by identifying the Brown-York tensor in Eq. (\ref{Tmn}) with
that of the dual CFT. Indeed, making the variation of (\ref{Tmn}) using the
asymptotic Killing vectors given by 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{+} &\rightarrow &x^{+}-\xi ^{+}-\frac{l^{2}}{2r^{2}}\partial _{-}^{2}\xi
^{-}\;, \\
x^{-} &\rightarrow &x^{-}-\xi ^{-}-\frac{l^{2}}{2r^{2}}\partial _{+}^{2}\xi
^{+}\;, \\
r &\rightarrow &r+\frac{r}{2}(\partial _{+}\xi ^{+}+\partial _{-}\xi ^{-})\;,
\end{eqnarray*}
and evaluating the expression for the ground state (for which $T_{\mu \nu }$
vanishes) one obtains 
\begin{equation}
\delta _{\xi }T_{++}=-\frac{l}{16\pi G}\partial _{+}^{3}\xi ^{+}\;.
\label{DeltaTmnBY}
\end{equation}
Comparison of (\ref{DeltaTmnBY}) with (\ref{DeltaTmnCFT}) yields the same
expression as one obtains for pure gravity with a negative cosmological constant, 
\[
c=\frac{3l}{2G}\;, 
\]
and hence, the Brown-Henneaux central charge is recovered from the AdS/CFT\
correspondence. It is simple to check that the counterterms explicitly containing
the scalar field do not contribute to the variation of the
quasilocal stress-energy tensor, and also that the same result would hold
if we had chosen the nullnut solution as the ground state.

In the case of pure gravity with the standard asymptotic conditions, the 
central charge was first obtained through the AdS/CFT correspondence by
Henningson and Skenderis \cite{Henningson:1998gx}.

As was noted in \cite{HMTZ}, it is worth mentioning that if one naively
follows the Cardy-Strominger approach \cite{Strominger:1997eq}, for the
black hole solution given by (\ref{Scalar}) and (\ref{The metric}), a value
for the entropy that always exceeds the semiclassical result is obtained,
thus violating in this way the holographic bound \cite{'tHooft:gx,Susskind:1994vu}.

\section{Discussion and comments}

A finite action for three-dimensional gravity with a minimally coupled
self-interacting scalar field has been constructed. Since the fall-off of
the fields at the asymptotic region was assumed to be slower than that of a
localized distribution of matter, the counterterm Lagrangian needed to
render the action finite acquires contributions depending explicitly on the
scalar field. This means that the quasilocal conserved charges also acquires
a non trivial contribution coming from the matter sector. This fact is in
agreement with results obtained via the Hamiltonian \cite{HMTZ} as well
as covariant methods \cite{Barnich:2002pi}.

The same central charge as for pure gravity was found by means of the
AdS/CFT correspondence. The required counterterms were found by demanding that the 
action attain an extremum for the boundary conditions mentioned above,
and this also insures the convergence of the action. A treatment of this
method in a more general settings will appear elsewhere.

The asymptotic conditions considered here correspond to exact solutions
including black holes. Had we assumed different asymptotic behavior for the
fields, different counterterms would be found. This problem has also been explored
 in three and higher dimensions \cite{Nojiri:2000kh, deHaro:2000xn, Berg:2002hy}.

The possibility of a phase transition between black holes and solutions with
naked singularities \cite{Das:2001rk} in three dimensions, as well as its
relevance for the AdS/CFT correspondence have been recently explored
 in Ref. \cite{Das:2001wu}. A more general discussion of the problem of the
thermodynamical properties of naked singularities in this model is currently
under study.
