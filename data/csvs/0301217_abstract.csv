The proper inclusion of flavor in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa proposal for the solution of 
${\cal N}=1$ gauge theories through matrix models has been subject of debate in the 
recent literature. We here reexamine this issue by geometrically engineering fundamental 
matter with type IIB branes wrapped on non-compact cycles in the resolved geometry, and 
following them through the geometric transition. Our approach treats massive and massless 
flavor fields on equal footing, including the mesons. We also study the geometric transitions and 
superpotentials for finite mass of the adjoint field. All superpotentials we compute reproduce 
the field theory results. Crucial insights come from T-dual brane constructions in type IIA.
