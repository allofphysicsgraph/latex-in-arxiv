\begin{abstract}
  We investigate the breakdown of supersymmetry at finite temperature.
  While it has been proven that temperature always breaks
  supersymmetry, the nature of this breaking is less clear. On the one
  hand, a study of the Ward-Takahashi identities suggests a
  spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry without the existence of a
  Goldstino, while on the other hand it has been shown that in any
  supersymmetric plasma there should exist a massless fermionic
  collective excitation, the phonino.  Aim of this work is to unify
  these two approaches. For the Wess-Zumino model, it is shown that
  the phonino exists and contributes to the supersymmetric
  Ward-Takahashi identities in the right way displaying that
  supersymmetry is broken spontaneously with the phonino as the
  Goldstone fermion.
