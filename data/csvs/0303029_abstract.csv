According to a recent proposal, the so-called Barbero-Immirzi
parameter of Loop Quantum Gravity can be fixed, using Bohr's
correspondence principle, from a knowledge of highly-damped black hole
oscillation frequencies. Such frequencies are rather difficult to
compute, even for Schwarzschild black holes. However, it is now quite
likely that they may provide a fundamental link between classical
general relativity and quantum theories of gravity.  Here we carry out
the first numerical computation of very highly damped quasinormal
modes (QNM's) for charged and rotating black holes. In the
Reissner-Nordstr\""om case QNM frequencies and damping times show an
oscillatory behaviour as a function of charge. The oscillations become
faster as the mode order increases. At fixed mode order, QNM's
describe spirals in the complex plane as the charge is increased,
tending towards a well defined limit as the hole becomes
extremal. Kerr QNM's have a similar oscillatory behaviour when the
angular index $m=0$. For $l=m=2$ and large enough rotation parameter
Kerr QNM frequencies tend to $2\Omega$, $\Omega$ being the angular
velocity of the black hole horizon.
