We investigate holography on an $(n-1)$-dimensional brane embedded in a
  background of AdS black holes, in $n$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet
  gravity. We demonstrate that for a critical brane near the AdS
  boundary, the Friedmann equation corresponds to that of the standard
  cosmology driven by a CFT dual to the AdS bulk. We show that there
  is no holographic description for non-critical branes, or when the
  brane is further away from the AdS boundary. We then derive a
  Cardy-Verlinde formula for the dual CFT on the critical brane near
  the boundary. This gives us insight into the remarkable
  correspondence between Cardy-Verlinde formul{\ae} and Friedmann
  equations in Einstein gravity.
