%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We propose a modified mode-expansion of the bulk fields in a BPS domain wall 
background to obtain the effective theory on the wall. 
The broken SUSY is nonlinearly realized on each mode 
defined by our mode-expansion. 
Our work clarifies a relation between two different approaches 
to derive the effective theory on a BPS wall, 
{\it i.e.} the nonlinear realization approach 
and the mode-expansion approach.  
We also discuss a further modification that respects the Lorentz 
and $U(1)_R$ symmetries broken by the wall.
