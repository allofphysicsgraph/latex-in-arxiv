  A simple model for the reheating of the universe after inflation is
  studied in which an essentially inhomogeneous scalar field
  representing matter is coupled to an essentially homogeneous scalar
  inflaton field. Through this coupling, the potential determining the
  evolution of the inflaton field is made time-dependent. Due to this
  the frequency of parametric resonance becomes time dependent, making
  the reheating process especially effective.

  All fields including the gravitational field are initially
  simplified by expanding each in terms of the respective homogeneity
  or inhomogeneity.  Employing only the lowest order of this
  expansion, we space-average, and introduce all independent averages
  as new variables. This leads to a hierarchy of equations for the
  spatial moments of the fields and their derivatives. A small
  expansion parameter permits a truncation to lowest order, yielding a
  closed system of 5 coupled nonlinear first order differential
  equations.

  For a parabolic potential, the energy densities of the matter and
  inflaton fields oscillate chaotically around each other from the end
  of inflation until they reach extremely small values. The average
  period of preponderance of one of the two continuously increases in
  this process. We discuss that this may provide one clue to a
  solution of the coincidence problem.

  For a Mexican hat potential we can easily obtain and understand
  dynamical symmetry breaking.
