We give brane-world solutions with cosmological constant $\lambda$
by introducing the dilaton in 5d bulk,
and we have examined the localization of graviton, gauge bosons and 
dilaton. 
For the solutions given here, we find that both graviton and gauge bosons 
can be trapped for any sign, positive and negative, and wide range of 
$\lambda$ due to the dilaton. 
On the other hand, the bulk dilaton can not be trapped as a stable 
particle on a 
brane of $\lambda\geq 0$. This implies a possible resolution of
the moduli problem and the equivalence principle in superstring theory
since the dilaton can not be localized on the brane
as a partner of the graviton.
