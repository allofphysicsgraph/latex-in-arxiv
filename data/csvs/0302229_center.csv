\caption{\it Contour integration in the complex $k_0$-plane for the
determination of the Green's function with the correct assymptotic
behaviour. The circles indicate the pairs of positions to which the poles are 
moved off the real axis by virtue of the corresponding 
$\epsilon$-prescription for the retarded
(black) and the advanced (white) propagator. The squares show
the position of the poles for the Feynman (white) and the reverse Feynman
(black) propagators. For the retarded and the advanced
propagators two poles or no pole is inside a given contour. For the Feynman
and reverse Feynman propagators exactly one pole is always inside any contour.}
