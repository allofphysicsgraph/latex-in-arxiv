We consider asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes in 
$d$-spacetime dimensions in the thermodynamically stable regime.  
We show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its leading
order corrections due to thermal fluctuations can be reproduced by a 
weakly interacting fluid of bosons and fermions (`holographic gas') 
in $\Delta=\alpha(d-2)+1$ spacetime dimensions, where 
the energy-momentum dispersion relation for the constituents of the 
fluid is assumed to be $\epsilon = \kappa p^\alpha$. We examine  
implications of this result for entropy bounds and the holographic 
hypothesis.
