\noindent We evaluate the fermion propagator in parity-conserving
$QED_3$ with $N$ flavours, in the context of an IR domain
approximation. This provides results which are non-perturbative in the
loopwise expansion sense. We include fermion-loop effects, and show
that they are relevant to the chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon,
that can be understood in this context.
