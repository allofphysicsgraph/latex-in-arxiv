In this first of a series of four articles, it is shown how a
hamiltonian quantum dynamics can be formulated based on a
generalization of classical probability theory using the
notion of quasi-invariant measures on the
classical phase space, based on
distributions rather than invariant Gibbs measures.  The 
first quantization is by functorial analytic
continuation of real probability amplitudes, effecting the
introduction of correlation between otherwise
independent subsystems, and whose physical consequence is the
incorporation of Breit-Wigner resonances associated to Gamow vectors into our
description of dynamics.  The resulting quantum
distribution density dynamics has a natural field theory
interpretation, the subject for future installments of this series.
