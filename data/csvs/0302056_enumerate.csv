\item Express the integral in polar coordinates as 
\EQ
\hat\Gamma_{jk}^i = 2\pi \int_0^{+\infty} 
d r \,r \,\langle\varphi_j(r) 
\varphi_k(0)\rangle_c^i \,\,\, , 
\EN 
and split the radial integral into two pieces as 
\begin{eqnarray}
& & I  = \int_0^{+\infty}  
d r \,r\,\langle \varphi_j(r) 
\varphi_k(0)\rangle_c^i 
\nonumber \\ 
&& =  \int_0^{R}  
d r \,r\,\langle
\ldots 
\rangle_c^i +  
\int_R^{+\infty}  
d r \,r\,\langle\ldots 
\rangle_c^i \nonumber 
\\
& & \equiv I_1(R) + I_2(R) 
\label{I1I2}
\,\,\,.
\end{eqnarray}
\item 
Use the best available short--distance representation of the 
correlator to evaluate $I_1(R)$ as well as the best available 
estimate of its large--distance representation to evaluate 
$I_2(R)$. 
\item Optimize the choice of the parameter $R$ in such a 
way to obtain the best evaluation of the whole integral. 
In practice, this means looking at that value of $R$ 
for which a plateau is obtained for the sum of $I_1(R)$ 
and $I_2(R)$. Said in another way, $R$ belongs to that 
interval where there is an overlap between the short--distance 
and the long--distance expansion of the correlator.
