``Jacobi realized that the (classical) Poisson brackets of the first
integrals of any hamiltonian system could be considered as a Poisson
structure [reference in original].

The construction of a Poisson structure on the dual space of a Lie
algebra leads to a new Lie algebra.  This construction may then be
repeated, leading to a whole series  of new (infinite dimensional)
Poisson structures.  More generally, suppose that one is given any
Poisson structure on a manifold.  Then the space of functions on that
manifold carries the structure of a Lie algebra.  This implies that
the dual space of this function space carries its own Poisson
structure.  Elements of this dual space may be interpreted as
distribution densities on the original manifold.  Thus, the space of
distributions on a Poisson manifold (for example, on a symplectic
phase space) has a natural Poisson structure.  This structure makes it
possible to apply the hamiltonian formalism to equations of Vlasov
type, which describe the evolution of distributions of particles in
phase space under the action of a field which is consistent with the
particles themselves.''
