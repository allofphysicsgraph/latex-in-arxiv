Global fits to precision cosmological data which
show that there is a dark energy component
comprising about 2/3 of the total cosmological energy also hint that a
dark energy with $w = P/\rho < -1$
is viable, even favored.
Here we discuss implications of such a surprising $w$,
including whether it jeopardizes vacuum stability.
It appears to be secure in microscopic processes,
but why bulk dark energy
has not decayed spontaneously
is mysterious.
