\noindent
We review in a pedagogical manner some of the efforts aiming to extend
the gauge/gravity correspondence to non-conformal supersymmetric gauge
theories in four dimensions. After giving a general overview, we
discuss in detail two specific examples: fractional D-branes on
orbifolds and D-branes wrapped on supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau
spaces. We explore in particular which gauge theory information can be
extracted from the corresponding supergravity solutions, and what the
remaining open problems are. We also briefly explain the connection
between these and other approaches, such as fractional branes on
conifolds, branes suspended between branes, M5-branes on Riemann
surfaces and M-theory  on G2-holonomy manifolds, and discuss the
r\^ole played by geometric transitions  in all that.
