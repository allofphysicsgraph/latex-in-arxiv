& \big[W^{(5)},W^{(5)}\big]  &= \tilde n(\tilde n -1) M^{(5)} + W^{(5)}  \, .
\end{align}
Our central charges are less ``central'' than in the super-Poincar\'e
case; the brackets with the supercharges mimic the brackets
in~(\ref{e:trivialstuff}):
\begin{equation}
\label{e:WQcomm}
\begin{aligned}
\big[ W^{(8)}, Q \big] &= \tfrac{\tilde m}{8}\, \Gamma Q\, ,&
  \big[ W^{(5)}, Q\big] &= \tfrac{\tilde n}{8}\, \Gamma Q\, ,\\[1ex]
\big[ Z^{(2|1)}, Q\big] &= C\, \Gamma Q\, , &
  \big[ Z^{(4|2)}, Q\big] &= D\, \Gamma Q\, ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
(where $C$ and $D$ are again determined in terms of $\tilde m$). The
appearance of non-trivial commutators like~(\ref{e:WQcomm}) is in fact
very general. They appear whenever the central charges transform
non-trivially under the action of the isometry generators, and these
isometry generators also appear on the right-hand side of the
$\{Q,Q\}$ bracket. In this case a non-trivial $[Q,Z]$ commutator is
required in order to make the $(Q,Q,Z)$ Jacobi identity work.

We also find that the central charges do not commute among each other:
\begin{equation}
\label{e:MZstuff}
\begin{aligned}
{}\big[M^{(8)}, Z^{(2|1)}\big] = \tilde{m}^{-1} \big[M^{(8)},
  Z^{(2|1)}\big] &= Z^{(2|1)}\,, \\
{}\big[M^{(5)}, Z^{(2|1)}\big] = \tilde{n}^{-1} \big[M^{(5)},
  Z^{(2|1)}\big] &= \tfrac{1}{2}\, Z^{(2|1)}\,, \\
{}\big[M^{(8)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big] = \tilde{m}^{-1} \big[W^{(8)},
  Z^{(4|2)}\big] &= 2\, Z^{(4|2)}\,, \\
{}\big[M^{(5)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big] = \tilde{n}^{-1} \big[W^{(5)},
  Z^{(4|2)}\big] &=  Z^{(4|2)}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The commutators between $Z^{(2|1)}$ and $Z^{(4|2)}$ are similarly
non-trivial but more complicated, see the appendix for details.  By a
rescaling of the fermions one can furthermore eliminate the dependence
on $\tilde{m}$ and $\tilde{n}$.

To summarise, the expressions~(\ref{e:QQcorrect})--(\ref{e:MZstuff})
define the maximally extended super-isometry algebra of the
$\text{AdS}_7\times S^4$ vacuum of M-theory. This algebra has the
structure
\begin{equation}
\label{e:thestructure}
\text{osp}(1|32)\oplus \big( \text{so}(6,2)\oplus
\text{so}(5)\big)\, ,
\end{equation}
but it is very important that the non-extended algebra
$\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ is embedded in this algebra in a non-trivial way,
as depicted in~(\ref{e:thediagram}) given in the introduction. We should
stress that, while it may make sense to write the algebra in a basis
which makes~(\ref{e:thestructure}) manifest (i.e.~using the hatted
generators), this is not the natural basis one would encounter in for
instance the supermembrane algebra. Moreover, it obscures the physical
meaning of the~$M$ generators as isometry generators of the
background.

Note that the Jacobi identities leave \emph{no room} for the inclusion
of a parameter which can smoothly tune the central charges to
zero. However, there is some freedom to completely discard
the~$Z^{(4|2)}$ charge, which may be important for certain
world-volume symmetry algebras.

\subsection{The flat space-time limit}

If our algebra is to be the correct one, it has to pass several
physical consistency checks.  One check is that there is a flat
space-time limit in which the algebra reduces to the centrally
extended, \mbox{super-$\text{iso}(6,1)\times \text{so}(4)$} algebra.
(Obviously, one can never recover the eleven-dimensional
super-Poincar\'e vacuum, since the local Lorentz algebra in the
\mbox{$\text{AdS}_7\times S^4$} space-time is broken from
$\text{so}(10,1)$ to \mbox{$\text{so}(6,1)\oplus \text{so}(4)$}, and
contraction does not change the number of generators).

To take the flat space-time limit of the $AdS_7\times S^4$ algebra
presented in the previous section we first rewrite the algebra in a
manifestly \mbox{$\text{so}(6,1) \oplus \text{so}(4)$} symmetric
form. The isometry generators in the two formulations are related
according to 
\begin{align}
\label{scal1}
M_{\underline{1}a}^{(8)} & \rightarrow R P_a \, , &  
   M_{ab}^{(8)} &\rightarrow M_{ab}^{(8)} \, , & 
   W^{(8)}_{\underline{1}a} & \rightarrow R^{\Sigma} W^{(1)}_{a} \, & 
   W^{(8)}_{ab} & \rightarrow R Z^{(2)}_{ab}  \, \\[1ex]
M_{5i}^{(5)} & \rightarrow R P_i \, , &  
   M_{ij}^{(5)} &\rightarrow M_{ij}^{(5)} \, , & 
   W^{(5)}_{5i} & \rightarrow R^{\Sigma} W^{(1)}_{i} \, , & 
   W^{(5)}_{ij} & \rightarrow R Z^{(2)}_{ij}  \, .
\end{align}
where we have split the indices as $A=(\underline{1},a)$ and
$I=(i,5)$. Here $R$ is the dimensionless radius of the AdS$_7$ factor
(i.e.~the dimensionful radius divided by the Planck length) while the
radius of the $S^4$ equals $R/2$. We will comment below on the value
of the parameter $\Sigma$ when we take the limit to flat
space-time. The $Z^{(2|1)}$ generators split as
\begin{equation}
\label{scal2}
Z^{(2|1)}_{\underline{1}a|i} \rightarrow R Z^{(2)}_{(1,1)} \, , \quad 
Z^{(2|1)}_{\underline{1}a|5} \rightarrow R Z^{(5)}_{(1,4)} \, , \quad
Z^{(2|1)}_{ab|5} \rightarrow R Z^{(5)}_{(2,0)}\equiv R Z^{(5)}_{(5,0)}  \, ,\quad
Z^{(2|1)}_{ab|i} \rightarrow R Z^{(5)}_{(2,3)} \, ,
\end{equation}
while the $Z^{(4|2)}$ generators split and scale as
\begin{equation}
Z^{(4|2)}_{\underline{1}abc|ij} \rightarrow R Z^{(5)}_{(3,2)} \, , \quad 
Z^{(4|2)}_{\underline{1}abc|i5} \rightarrow R Z^{(5)}_{(4,1)} \, .
\end{equation}
We used the notation $Z^{(2)}_{(p,q)}$ and $Z^{(5)}_{(p,q)}$ to denote
a two-form resp.~five-form which transforms as a $(p,q)$-form under
the $\text{so}(6,1) \oplus \text{so}(4)$ algebra.  Counting the
generators, we are left with precisely the number of central charges
expected in the flat space-time algebra, except for the two additional
$W^{(1)}$~charges. However, as we will see, these additional charges
do not pose problems. Finally, the supercharges are redefined as
\begin{equation}
Q \rightarrow \sqrt{R} Q \, .
\end{equation} 

The flat space-time limit is now obtained by taking the
$R\rightarrow\infty$ limit. In order to compare the result with a
direct construction of the algebra in flat space-time, one has to
express the $\text{so}(6,2)\oplus\text{so}(5)$ gamma matrices in terms
of $\text{so}(6,1)\oplus\text{so}(4)$ ones (this can be done by using
$\text{so}(10,1)$ intermediate notation as explained in~(\ref{clif1})
and~(\ref{clif2}) in the appendix). One easily finds agreement between
these two results. The $\{ Q, Q \}$ bracket turns into
\begin{equation}
\label{e:QQ-11dbreak}
\begin{aligned}
\{ Q , Q \} &= 
     \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{a}C^{-1}\big)      P_a 
   + \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^i C^{-1}\big)       P_i 
   + \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{ab} C^{-1}\big)    Z_{ab}^{(2)} 
   + \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{ij} C^{-1}\big)    Z_{ij}^{(2)} 
   + \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{ai} \tilde\Gamma C^{-1}\big)    Z_{ai}^{(2)}\\[1ex]
  &+ \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{abijk} C^{-1}\big) Z_{abijk}^{(5)} 
   + \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{aijkl} C^{-1}\big) Z_{aijkl}^{(5)} 
   + \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{abcde}\tilde\Gamma C^{-1}\big) Z_{abcde}^{(5)} \\[1ex]
  &+ \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{abcdi} C^{-1}\big) Z_{abcdi}^{(5)} 
   + \big(\tilde{\Gamma}^{abcij} C^{-1}\big) Z_{abcij}^{(5)} \, ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\Gamma}^a$ and $\tilde\Gamma^{i}$ are gamma matrices in
$C(6,1)$ and $C(4,0)$ respectively, $\tilde\Gamma$ denotes the
chirality matrix in $C(4,0)$ and the charge conjugation matrix is
given by $C \equiv C_{(6,1)} \times C_{(4)}$. Note that the
four-dimensional spinors are not Weyl, which explains the appearance
of~$\tilde\Gamma$, yet dualisation has been freely used in the
seven-dimensional sector (for instance to
identify~$Z^{(5)}_{(2,0)}\equiv Z^{(5)}_{(5,0)}$ in~(\ref{scal2})). The
bracket~(\ref{e:QQ-11dbreak}) is precisely what one would get if one
were to construct this flat-space central extension from scratch.

Several comments are in order here.  Firstly, note that flat space
five-form $Z^{(5)}$ arises both from the $Z^{(2|1)}$ and the $Z^{(2|4)}$
charges.  Secondly, the parameter $\Sigma$ in~(\ref{scal1}) with which
we scale the $W^{(8)}$ and $W^{5}$ charges should lie in the range
\begin{equation}
\tfrac{1}{2} < \Sigma \leq 1 \, .
\end{equation}
For $\tfrac{1}{2}<\Sigma<1$, the charges $W^{(1)}_a$ and $W^{(1)}_i$
decouple from the remainder of the algebra in the flat space-time
limit: they disappear from the $\{Q,Q\}$ bracket and become mutually
commuting, while keeping their transformation property under the
action of the $M$ generators.\footnote{It might be that this one-form
charge is related to the possibility of constructing kappa-symmetric
open membranes which end on a string~\cite{deWit:1997fp}.} In the case
$\Sigma=1$, these two one-form charges combine with the momenta, and
appear only through the combinations $(P_a+W_a)$ and $(P_i+W_i)$ in
the full algebra. The other linear combination has trivial commutators
with all other generators, including the Lorentz generators $M$. This
case is perhaps more natural and resembles a similar situation in
string theory, where winding charges combine with
momenta~\cite{town6}.

Finally, note that it was crucial for the correct flat space limit
that the generators $M^{8,5}$ and $W^{8,5}$ get scaled away from the
$\{Q , Q \}$ commutator, but \emph{not} $\hat{M}^{(8,5)}$,
$\hat{W}^{(8,5)}$. The latter option would lead to a reduction of the
number of generators on the right hand side of this commutator, while
the left hand side would still contain the same number of
components. Hence, to take the the correct flat space limit it is
crucial to correctly identify the bosonic isometry generator as
belonging to the \emph{diagonal} $\text{so}(6,2) \times \text{so}(4)$
within the algebra~(\ref{e:thestructure}).



\subsection{The super-Poincar\'e algebra from a diagonal embedding}

While the presence of $\text{osp}(1|32)$ in our algebra is reminiscent
of the structure of the maximally extended super-Poincar\'e algebra,
the isometry generators are embedded in a different way, namely
through ``diagonal embedding'' instead of through a semi-direct
sum. In the present section we would like to comment on this
difference and show how the diagonal embedding approach also works for
the flat space-time situation.

Remember that a contraction of the $\text{osp}(1|32)$ algebra
leads to the maximally extended eleven-dimensional
super-\emph{translation} algebra~\cite{town3}, spanned by the
translation generators~$P$ and two- and five-form central
charges~$Z^{(2)}$ and~$Z^{(5)}$.  To obtain the full super-Poincar\'e
algebra, one has to add the Lorentz generators of the
$\text{so}(10,1)$ algebra separately:~one starts with the semi-direct
sum $\text{so}(10,1) \inplus \text{osp}(1|32)$ (where
$\text{so}(10,1)$ acts non-trivially on $\text{osp}(1|32)$), and does
not scale these generators in the process of contraction.

Alternatively, inspired by the structure that has appeared in the
previous section, one could start from the algebra
$\text{osp}(1|32)\oplus \text{so}(10,1)$ (where ``$\oplus$'' denotes
the \emph{direct} sum). Let us denote the generators of
$\text{so}(10,1)$ in $\text{osp}(1|32)$ with $\hat{Z}^{(2)}$ and the ones
sitting in the other $\text{so}(10,1)$ with $\hat{M}^{(2)}$.  Decomposing
the $\{Q, Q \}$ commutator with respect to the $\text{so}(10,1)$
subalgebra of $\text{osp}(1|32)$, one gets the familiar expression
\begin{equation} 
{} \{ Q , \, Q \} \sim \hat{P} + \hat{Z}^{(2)} + \hat{Z}^{(5)} \, \, . 
\end{equation}
The rest of the $\text{osp}(1|32)$ commutators can be written schematically as
\begin{align}
\label{flat-comm}
{} &[ \hat{Z}^{(2)} , \, \hat{Z}^{(2)} ] \,  \sim \hat{Z}^{(2)} \quad
\, &  &[ \hat{Z}^{(2)} \,
, \hat{Z}^{(5)} \, ]  \sim \hat{Z}^{(2)} + \hat{Z}^{(5)} \, & 
 & [ \hat{Z}^{(5)}\, , \hat{Z}^{(5)} ] \,  \sim \hat{Z}^{(2)} \, + \, \hat{Z}^{(5)} \\
{} &[ \hat{P}, Z^{(2)} ]  \sim \hat{P} \, &  & [ \hat{P}, \hat{Z}^{(5)} ]  \sim \hat{Z}^{(5)} \, & & [
\hat{P}, \hat{P} ]  \sim \hat{P} + \hat{Z}^{(2)} \, .
\end{align}
As in the AdS case, one identifies the Lorentz generators of the flat
vacuum with a diagonal subalgebra of the two~$\text{so}(10,1)$ algebras,
\begin{equation}
M^{(2)} \equiv \hat{M}^{(2)} + \hat{Z}^{(2)} \, , \quad Z^{(2)}
 \equiv \hat{M}^{(2)} - \hat{Z}^{(2)}\,,\quad P \equiv \hat{P}  \, .
\end{equation}
In taking the contraction to the flat space limit, one scales the
generators as
\begin{equation}
\label{scal}
Q \rightarrow \sqrt{R} Q \, , \quad P \rightarrow R P \, , \quad
M \rightarrow M \, ,  \quad Z^{(2)} \rightarrow R
Z^{(2)} \, , \quad Z^{(5)} \rightarrow R Z^{(5)} \, .
\end{equation}
It is now obvious that by rewriting~(\ref{flat-comm}) in terms of the
new variables~$M^{(2)}$ and~$Z^{(2)}$ and applying the
scaling~(\ref{scal}), one arrives at the commutation relations of the
full super-Poincar\'e algebra (with trivial commutation relations
between all central charges and a nontrivial action of the Lorentz
generators~$M^{(2)}$ on all central charges).  Note that before the
contraction, the $\{ Q , Q \}$ commutator contains, just as in the AdS
case, a linear combination of the bosonic generators and central
charges. Additionally, the bosonic generators drop out from the
commutator only after having taken the~$R \rightarrow \infty$ limit.

From the two explicit examples we have worked out in detail in this
note, it is suggestive that the general form of the complete
\mbox{M-theory} algebra could be of the form $\text{osp}(1|32) \oplus
G$, where $G$ is a minimal \emph{bosonic} algebra that incorporates
the isometry algebras of all M-theory vacua. However, we still have to
analyse the representation theory of our algebra and compare it with
the representation theory of~$\text{osp}^*(8|4)$.

\subsection{Representation theory and the graviton multiplet}
\label{s:reptheory}

If the centrally extended algebra presented in this paper is to be
compatible with existing literature, we should show (at the very
least) that the massless graviton multiplet of the
non-extended~$\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ algebra ``lifts'' to a representation
of the bigger algebra. The fact that the $\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ algebra
is not a sub-superalgebra of the algebra we have constructed means
that, apart from the fact that we have introduced new
generators~(central charges), we have also modified the action of the
``old'' generators~(supercharges). A ``lift'' of existing
supermultiplets of $\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ can therefore not be just a
simple embedding.  Since the new generators of the extended algebra
have non-trivial commutation relations with the supercharges, the
various states in a supermultiplet will in principle transform
non-trivially under the action of the central charges. Hence, a single
state of the old algebra is generically lifted to a set of states with
the same values of the old quantum numbers, yet with non-zero values of the
central charges. 

The graviton multiplet is a short multiplet: when constructing the
multiplet by repeatedly acting on the lowest energy states with
energy-raising supersymmetry operators, one encounters some states
which have zero norm and are therefore absent from the
multiplet. Consider now the eigenvalue problem
\begin{equation}
\det \Big( \langle \phi| \{Q_\alpha, Q_\beta\} 
   - \lambda \delta_{\alpha\beta}|\phi\rangle \Big) = 0
\end{equation}
for a given state $|\phi\rangle$. Because of the existence of null
vectors some supercharges act trivially on $|\phi\rangle$, and the
polynomial on the left-hand side will have a number of zeroes at
$\lambda=0$. Some of these are trivial: for e.g.~a ground state, where
we know that all energy-lowering operators should vanish identically,
we find a factor $\lambda^{16}$.  The non-trivial factor(s) of this
polynomial constitute the BPS equation(s) for the given state
$|\phi\rangle$.

The unitary irreducible representations of $\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ are
uniquely labeled~\cite{Gunaydin:1985wc} by representations of its
maximal compact bosonic subalgebra
$\text{so}(2)\times\text{su}(4)\times \text{so}(5)$.\footnote{Note
that each unitary irrep of the compact subgroup $\text{so}(2)\times\text{su}(4)$
gives rise to an \emph{infinite-dimensional} representation of the
full non-compact group~$\text{so}(6,2)$. This reflects the general
fact that there are no finite-dimensional unitary representations of
non-compact groups.}  The BPS equations on a state are expressed in
terms of the associated quantum numbers. By ``lifted state'' we now
mean a state in a multiplet of the extended algebra which transforms
in the same way under the bosonic generators inherited from the old
algebra, and is annihilated by the same number of supercharges as
before\footnote{Lifting the representation of the diagonal
subalgebra to the full one can be understood more easily by
considering a toy example, for instance the lift of $\text{su}(2)$
representations to $\text{su}(2)\times \text{su}(2)$ in which it is
embedded.}.  The BPS condition for the state in the extended algebra can
be derived from
\begin{equation}
\langle \phi | \{ Q, Q\} |\phi\rangle = 
\langle \phi | \Big( M^{(8)} - 2 M^{(5)} + W^{(8)} + W^{(5)} + Z^{(2|1)} +
Z^{(4|2)}\Big) | \phi\rangle\, .
\end{equation}
The first two terms on the right-hand side are the
same as in the $\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ algebra, and hence vanish, when
evaluated on any $\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ BPS state. Using simple
representation theory arguments one can show that the expectation
values of \emph{some} of the central charges in \emph{some} of the
gravity multiplet states vanish. There are, for instance, several
$\text{AdS}_7$ scalars in the graviton
multiplet~\cite{Gunaydin:1985wc} (the ``dilaton'') which carry the
$\text{so}(2)\times\text{su}(4)\times \text{so}(5)$ quantum numbers
$[4,0,0,0,2,0]$. The tensor product with~$Z^{(2|1)}$ does not contain
this dilaton representation, and the presence of
$\langle\phi|Z^{(2|1)}|\phi\rangle$ does therefore not modify the BPS
equation for these particular states.

However, this simple argument cannot be used to deduce the absence of
all central charges from the BPS equation for all states. This is
essentially due to the fact that there are central charges which
transform in the same way as either $M^{(8)}$ or $M^{(5)}$ under the
action of the $\text{so}(5)$ group. This then implies that their
expectation values in the supergraviton states are generically
non-vanishing. The only way they could drop out from the BPS equations is
if they accidentally vanish for the given representation, or if they
conspire together to give zero.  It seems unlikely that this will
happen in general, but a definite conclusion will require the explicit
construction of the representations of the full algebra, which we will not
attempt here.


\section{Discussion}

We have constructed a maximal central extension of the super-isometry
algebra of the \mbox{$\text{AdS}_7\times S^4$} vacuum of
\mbox{M-theory} by adding new bosonic charges to the isometry algebra
\mbox{$\text{osp}^*(8|4)$} (a similar construction is possible for the
other supersymmetric vacua of \mbox{M-theory} and those of string
theory). These additional charges are even less central than those
that appear in the extension of the super-Poincar\'e algebra: just as
in the supersymmetric extension of conformal algebras~\cite{holt4}
they commute neither with the other bosonic charges nor with the
supercharges. While our algebra satisfies a couple of physical
consistency checks, we have also argued that the structure might lead
to a representation theory which does not produce the expected
``lifted'' $\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ multiplets.

The extension constructed here exhibits non-abelian central charges,
which is a generic feature of extensions of AdS algebras. This implies
that a direct interpretation of the central charge generators in terms
of brane charges becomes more complicated than in flat space-time. One
particular situation in which the analysis may be simplified is in the
Hpp-wave limit of the background discussed in this paper. Branes in
this background have been studied using probe branes, boundary states
and supergravity solutions, but a simple classification using
representation theory of a centrally extended algebra would be
desirable; we intend to investigate this problem in the near future.

It is conceivable that our extension is still too conservative, and
that the problems in finding a correct perturbative spectrum arise
because an even larger algebra should be considered. Our analysis
shows that one is then \emph{forced} to introduce additional fermionic
charges, which may perhaps lead to an $\text{osp}(1|32)\oplus
\text{osp}(1|32)$ structure. Fermionic extensions actually seem
to be suggested by an analysis of the superalgebra of the matrix model
in a pp-wave background, and we will report on this issue
elsewhere~\cite{mpz2}.

\appendix
\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Conventions and Clifford algebras}

Our $\text{so}(6,2)$ spinors are taken to be anti-Weyl, so together
with our conventions for the $\text{so}(5)$ part we have
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{{A}_1\cdots {A}_8} = 
   -\epsilon^{{A}_1\cdots {A}_8}\, ,\quad
\Gamma^{{I}_1\cdots {I}_5} =
   \epsilon^{{I}_1\cdots{I}_5}\, .
\end{equation}
This is consistent with our choice for anti-self-duality of the
central charge $Z^{(4|2)}$,
\begin{equation}
\label{e:antiselfduality}
Z^-_{{A}{B}{C}{D}|{I}{J}} = 
-\tfrac{1}{4!}\epsilon_{{A}{B}{C}{D}}{}^{{E}{F}{G}{H}}
Z^-_{{E}{F}{G}{H} | {I}{J}}\, .
\end{equation} 

We use the notation $C(t,s)$ for the Clifford algebra for 
a Lorentz-like metric with signature~$(t,s)$. The explicit
representation of $C(6,1)\otimes C(4,0)$ by means of $C(10,1)$ is
given by $(a=0,\ldots,6; \, i=7,\ldots,10)$,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{clif1}
\tilde{\Gamma}^{i} &= \gamma^{i} \,, & 
\tilde{\Gamma}^{a} &= \gamma^{*}\gamma^{a}\,,  \\
\gamma^{*} &= \gamma^{7\ldots 10}\,, & 
C &= {\cal C}_{(11)}\gamma^* \,,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
while a representation of $C(6,2)\otimes C(5,0)$ by means of $C(10,1)$
is given by 
\begin{equation}
\label{clif2}
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma^{i} &= \gamma^{i}\otimes 1\,, & 
  \Gamma^{y} &= -i\gamma^{*}\otimes 1\,,\\[1ex]
\Gamma^{a} &= \gamma^{*}\gamma^{a}\otimes\sigma^{1}\,, &
  \Gamma^{\underline{1}} &= -1\otimes \sigma^{2}\,,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where, in the notation of footnote~\ref{f:indexrange}, the index ranges are
$(A=\underline{1},0,\cdots,6;\, I=7,\ldots,10,y)$.  The charge
conjugation matrix of this 13-dimensional representation and the Weyl
projector in the $\text{so}(6,2)$ factor are given by
\begin{equation}
  {\cal C}_{(13)} = {\cal C}_{(11)}\ \gamma^{*}\otimes 1 
  ,\quad\text{and}\quad
\Gamma_{(9)} = 1\otimes\sigma^{3}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Solving the Jacobi identities}

As explained in the main text, we have derived the central extension
of the $\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ algebra by starting from a general ansatz
and solving the Jacobi identities. The key steps are presented
below. The most important ingredient in our ansatz is the bracket
\begin{equation}
\label{e:QQansatz}
{}\{ Q, Q \} = a M^{(8)} + \tilde{a} W^{(8)} + b M^{(5)} 
  + \tilde{b} W^{(5)} + c Z^{(2|1)} + d Z^{(4|2)} \, \, .
\end{equation}
where we have suppressed all indices and gamma matrices for brevity.
We will use the standard $\text{so}(6,2)$ and $\text{so}(5)$ brackets
for the isometry generators. One may actually think of adding
central charges to these~$[M,M]$ commutators, but apart from the reasons
against this which were given in the introduction, one also quickly
finds out that in this case it is impossible to satisfy the
$(Q,Q,Z)$ and $(M,M,Z)$ Jacobi identities at the same time. 
The most general form of the commutators involving the generators
$M^{(8)}$, $M^{(5)}$ and the new central charges $W^{(8)}$, $W^{(5)}$
is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
{}\big[M^{(8)},W^{(8)}\big] &= \alpha M^{(8)} + \tilde{\alpha} W^{(8)} \,,
&  \big[W^{(8)},W^{(8)}\big] &= \beta M^{(8)} + \tilde{\beta} W^{(8)} \\
{}\big[M^{(5)},W^{(5)}\big] &= \gamma M^{(5)} + \tilde{\gamma} W^{(5)} \,,
& \big[W^{(5)},W^{(5)}\big] &= \delta M^{(5)} + \tilde{\delta} W^{(5)}  \, .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
These generators act on the fermionic charges as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\big[ M^{(8)}, Q \big] &= A\, \Gamma Q\, , & 
  \big[ M^{(5)}, Q\big] &= B\, \Gamma Q\, ,\\[1ex]
\big[ W^{(8)}, Q \big] &= A_z\, \Gamma Q\, ,&
  \big[ W^{(5)}, Q\big] &= B_z\, \Gamma Q\, ,\\[1ex]
\big[ Z^{(2|1)}, Q\big] &= C\, \Gamma Q\, , &
  \big[ Z^{(4|2)}, Q\big] &= D\, \Gamma Q\, .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
What remains is to fix the commutators with the $Z^{(2|1)}$ and
$Z^{(4|2)}$ charges. These are parametrised as
\begin{equation}
\label{Z21}
\begin{aligned}
{}\big[M^{(8)}, Z^{(2|1)}\big] &= m\, Z^{(2|1)}\,,  &  \big[W^{(8)},
Z^{(2|1)}\big] &= \tilde{m} \big[M^{(8)}, Z^{(2|1)}\big] \,, \\
{}\big[M^{(5)}, Z^{(2|1)}\big] &= n\, Z^{(2|1)}\,,  &  \big[W^{(5)},
Z^{(2|1)}\big] &= \tilde{n} \big[M^{(5)}, Z^{(2|1)}\big]\, ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{Z42}
\begin{aligned}
{}\big[M^{(8)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big] = \mu\, Z^{(4|2)}\,, \quad \quad &  \big[W^{(8)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big] = \tilde{\mu} \big[M^{(8)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big]\,, \\
{}\big[M^{(5)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big] = \nu\, Z^{(4|2)}\,, \quad \quad &  \big[W^{(5)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big] = \tilde{\nu} \big[M^{(5)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big]\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The ``standard'' central charges obey the commutators
\begin{equation}
\label{e:standardZZansatz}
\begin{aligned}
{}\big[Z^{(2|1)}, Z^{(2|1)}\big] &= p M^{{(8)}} + \tilde{p} Z^{{(8)}} + q M^{4} + \tilde{q} W^{(5)} + r Z^{(4|2)} \, ,\\[1ex]
{}\big[Z^{(2|1)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big] &= 
  \rho \Big( Z^{(2|1)} - \frac{1}{4!} \epsilon_8 Z^{(2|1)}\Big)
  +\sigma \epsilon_5 Z^{(4|2)}\, ,\\[1ex]
{}\big[Z^{(4|2)}, Z^{(4|2)}\big] &=  
   (\delta - \tfrac{2}{4!}\epsilon ) (\lambda M^{(8)} + \tilde\lambda W^{(8)})
 + (\delta - \tfrac{1}{4!}\epsilon ) (\kappa M^{(5)} + \tilde\kappa W^{(5)} )\\[1ex]
 &\quad + \chi (\delta - \tfrac{1}{4!}\epsilon) Z^{(2|1)}
 + \phi Z^{(4|2)}\, .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The structure involving the $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ parts is
determined by imposing self-duality on the tensors on the left-hand
side; explicit indices can easily be inserted.

The parameters $a$ and $b$ are fixed to be $a=1$ and $b=-2$ because we
want the structure of the $\text{osp}^*(8|4)$ algebra to be manifestly
present in the $\{Q,Q\}$ bracket. In order to determine the remaining
parameters, we first scale the generators $W^{(8)}$, $W^{(5)}$ and
$Z^{(1|1)}$ in such a way that
\begin{equation}
\label{e:scalings}
\tilde\beta = 1\, ,\quad
\tilde\delta = 1\, ,\quad
p = \pm 1\, ,
\end{equation}
which is always possible. The $(M,M,W)$ Jacobi identities restrict the
way in which the two-form charges act on each other; from
$(M^{(8)},M^{(8)},W^{(8)})$ one finds
\begin{equation}
\{ \alpha=0\,,\; \tilde\alpha=1\} \quad\text{or}\quad \tilde\alpha=0\, .
\end{equation}
Similar conditions for $\gamma$ and $\tilde\gamma$ arise from
$(M^{(5)},M^{(5)},W^{(5)})$.  We discard the second option because it
makes the interpretation of the $M$~charges as isometry generators
troublesome. The action of these isometry generators on the
``standard'' central charges $Z^{(2|1)}$ and $Z^{(4|2)}$ is fixed by
imposing the following Jacobi identities:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\big(M^{(8)},M^{(8)},Z^{(2|1)}\big) &\rightarrow m=1\, ,&
\big(M^{(5)},M^{(5)},Z^{(2|1)}\big) &\rightarrow n=\tfrac{1}{2}\, ,\\[1ex]
\big(M^{(8)},M^{(8)},Z^{(4|2)}\big) &\rightarrow \mu=2\, ,&
\big(M^{(5)},M^{(5)},Z^{(4|2)}\big) &\rightarrow \nu=1\, .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
One now first fixes the action of all two-form charges on the fermions,
using for instance the Jacobi identities
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\big(M^{(8)}, Q, Q\big) &\rightarrow A =\tfrac{1}{8}\, ,&
\big(M^{(5)}, Q, Q\big) &\rightarrow B =\tfrac{1}{8}\, ,\\[1ex]
\big(W^{(8)}, Q, Q\big) &\rightarrow A_z =\tfrac{\tilde m}{8}=\tfrac{\tilde\mu}{8}\, ,&
\big(W^{(5)}, Q, Q\big) &\rightarrow B_z =\tfrac{\tilde n}{8}=\tfrac{\tilde\nu}{8}\, .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The structure of the algebra in the sector of the two-form charges is
then fixed to a large extent from the Jacobi identities
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\big(W^{(8)}, W^{(8)}, Q\big) &\rightarrow \beta = \tilde m(\tilde m
-1)\, ,\\[1ex]
\big(W^{(5)}, W^{(5)}, Q\big) &\rightarrow \delta = \tilde n(\tilde n
-1 )\, ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and using a different part of the $(Z,Q,Q)$ identities,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\big(W^{(8)}, Q, Q\big) &\rightarrow \tilde a = \frac{1}{\tilde m
-1}\, ,\\[1ex]
\big(W^{(5)}, Q, Q\big) &\rightarrow \tilde b = \frac{-2}{\tilde n
-1}\, .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
A key relation between the two remaining parameters $\tilde m$ and
$\tilde n$ is found from
\begin{equation}
\label{e:mnrel}
\begin{aligned}
\big( Z^{(2|1)}, Q, Q \big) &\rightarrow \frac{2\tilde m-1}{\tilde
m-1} = 8\,cC = -2\frac{2\tilde n-1}{\tilde n-1}\, ,\\[1ex]
\big( Z^{(4|2)}, Q, Q \big) &\rightarrow cC = 2\cdot 4! dD\, .
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This last line ensures that the triple-$Q$ identity is satisfied,
since it leads to
\begin{equation}
\big(Q,Q,Q\big) \rightarrow 2(aA + \tilde{a} A_z) 
+ (bB + \tilde{b}B_z) + 2\,cC - 10\cdot 4!\, dD\, .
\end{equation}
Finally, one determines the way in which the $W$ charges appear in the
$[Z^{(2|1)},Z^{(2|1)}]$ bracket by considering
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
(Z^{(2|1)},Z^{(2|1)}, W^{(8)}) &\rightarrow \tilde p =
\frac{1}{\tilde{m}-1}\, ,\\[1ex]
(Z^{(2|1)},Z^{(2|1)}, W^{(5)}) &\rightarrow \tilde q =
\frac{1}{\tilde{n}-1}\, ,\\[1ex]
(Q,Q,Z^{(2|1)}) &\rightarrow q=\mp 1\, ,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
(the sign in the last equation depending on the sign of~$p$
in~(\ref{e:scalings})). Analogously one determines similar 
coefficients in the $[Z^{(4|2)}, Z^{(4|2)}]$ bracket from
\begin{equation}
(Q,Q,Z^{(4|2)}) \rightarrow (\tilde{m}-1) \tilde\lambda = \lambda\,,\quad
                            (\tilde{n}-1) \tilde\kappa  = \kappa\, .
\end{equation}

The Jacobi identies not listed so far do not impose any further
restrictions on the parameters. At this stage, one can now diagonalise
the algebra in the two-form sector, as explained in the main text, and
obtain the structure given in~(\ref{e:thestructure}).
