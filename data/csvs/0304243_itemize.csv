\item
  Simple and intuitive.
\item
  Complete classificiation: We can take into
  account all the symmetries from a given group.
\item
  Easy to find the origin of a symmetry:
  We can see pictorially which symmetry comes
  from which group.
  From the example we presented earlier, the origin of
  $SU(3)^3$ from $E_6$ is easily seen.
