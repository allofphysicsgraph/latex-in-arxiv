copy any tex files that you want to parse latex from into this directory.

run make

several csv files will be generated with output from flex

REGENERATE_ALL_FLEX_SCRIPTS.sh
	will generate a small subset of the flex files listed in the bash script. 
	anything that you modidfy from the base template, you will want to exclude from the list or it will be overwritten. 
	but (****hopefully****) should be saved in the folder flex_scripts_backup just in case.


frac.l works well, but there are some cases where it fails.
frac12 frac1{2} and some cases where it throws an error ‘./frac.out’ terminated by signal 11


All of the lexers in this directory depend on braces, even though there are
several cases where they are not enforced, an example is \\item. 

I am considering multiple passes to get the accuracy and precision as close to
100% as I can. 

verify_counts in utils can be used to compare the number of matches by the
Flex lexers and a simple python regex. 


More advanced test cases will be provided soon.
