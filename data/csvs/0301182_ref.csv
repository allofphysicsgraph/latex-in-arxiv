{scmb}) as the actual entropy of the fluctuations. It is more appropriate to
view (\ref{scmb}) as the upper limit on the amount of information that can
be present in the fluctuations. The actual entropy that we should assign to
the fluctuations are much smaller than the value given in (\ref{scmb}) --
the difference is the information contained in the acoustic peaks. From the
point of view of the local observer, both thermal and non-thermal
fluctuations start out on small scales but expand and is eventually
contained in the degrees of freedom of the horizon. From the local observer
point of view this means that they all have thermalized.

\section{The slow roll}

\bigskip

Let us investigate how the above ideas work in more detail in the presence
of a slowly changing Hubble constant in a slow roll universe. The Friedman
equations in the presence of a scalar inflaton is given by 
\begin{equation}
H^{2}=\frac{8\pi l_{p}^{2}}{3}\left( \frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^{2}+V\left( \phi
\right) \right) ,  \label{fesl}
\end{equation}
while the equation of motion for the scalar field is given by 
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\phi}+3H\dot{\phi}=-V^{\prime }\left( \phi \right) .
\end{equation}
It is useful to define a slowroll parameter according to 
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon =\frac{1}{16\pi l_{p}^{2}}\left( \frac{V^{\prime }\left( \phi
\right) }{V\left( \phi \right) }\right) ^{2},
\end{equation}
and assume $\varepsilon $ to be small. To lowest, zeroth, order in $%
\varepsilon $ the Hubble constant will be fixed at 
\begin{equation}
H^{2}\sim \frac{8\pi l_{p}^{2}}{3}V\left( \phi \right) ,
\end{equation}
(that is, the potential energy will dominate over the kinetic energy in
contributing to the vacuum energy) while $\phi $ is slowly varying according
to 
\begin{equation}
3H\dot{\phi}\sim -V^{\prime }\left( \phi \right) .
\end{equation}
To first order in $\varepsilon $ there will, however, be a variation in $H$
determined by 
\begin{equation}
\dot{H}=-\varepsilon H^{2},
\end{equation}
which is easily integrated to give 
\begin{equation}
H\left( t\right) =\frac{H_{0}}{1+\varepsilon H_{0}t},
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
a\left( t\right) =\left( 1+\varepsilon H_{0}t\right) ^{1/\varepsilon }.
\end{equation}
We have chosen the constants of integration such that $H\left( 0\right)
=H_{0}$ and $a\left( 0\right) =1$.

A useful model for a slow roll is to assume a cosmological constant together
with another matter component with an equation of state given by $p=w\rho $,
with $w$ constant. In this setup the first Friedman equation becomes 
\begin{equation}
H^{2}=\frac{8\pi l_{p}^{2}}{3}\left( \rho +\rho _{\Lambda }\right) ,
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\rho =\frac{\rho _{0}}{a^{q}},
\end{equation}
with $q=3\left( 1+w\right) $. \ We assume $q>0$; $q=0$ would just give an
additional contribution to the true cosmological constant. The Friedman
equation at $t=0$ now tells us that 
\begin{equation}
H_{0}^{2}=\frac{8\pi l_{p}^{2}}{3}\left( \rho _{0}+\rho _{\Lambda }\right) ,
\end{equation}
while first order in $t$ implies 
\begin{equation}
q\Omega =2\varepsilon ,
\end{equation}
where we have defined 
\begin{equation}
\rho _{0}=\Omega \rho _{c}=\frac{3H_{0}^{2}\Omega }{8\pi l_{p}^{2}}.
\end{equation}
As expected, the energy density in the extra matter is suppressed compared
to the cosmological constant. Let us now compare the area of the final
horizon given by 
\begin{equation}
A_{f}=4\pi \left( \frac{8\pi l_{p}^{2}}{3}\rho _{\Lambda }\right) ^{-2},
\end{equation}
and the (smaller) one at $t=0$ given by

\begin{equation}
A_{0}=4\pi \left( \frac{8\pi l_{p}^{2}}{3}\left( \rho _{0}+\rho _{\Lambda
}\right) \right) ^{-2}.
\end{equation}
A short calculation (assuming $\Omega $ small) reveals that 
\begin{equation}
\Delta A=A_{f}-A_{0}=\frac{2\varepsilon }{q}A_{f}.  \label{da}
\end{equation}
The matter energy contained within the volume is given by 
\begin{equation}
E=\frac{4\pi }{3}\rho _{0}H_{0}^{-3}=\frac{\varepsilon }{q}\frac{r}{l_{p}^{2}%
},
\end{equation}
and we therefore conclude that the entropy contained in the matter is
limited by 
\begin{equation}
S\leq \frac{1}{4}\frac{\Delta A}{l_{p}^{2}}=2\pi EH_{0}^{-1}=2\pi Er.
\end{equation}
This is simply an example of the D-bound at work.

It is instructive to compare with the calculation in \cite{Albrecht:2002xs}
where the horizon was obtained from (\ref{fesl}) either by keeping the
kinetic term (the exact apparent horizon), or dropping the kinetic term (the
slow roll approximation)$.$ This lead to a difference in area given by 
\begin{equation}
\Delta A=A_{f}-A_{0}=\frac{\varepsilon }{3}A_{f},  \label{dak}
\end{equation}
and a corresponding entropy bound. It is easy to see that this is a special
case of the discussion above. The parameter $w$ in the equation of state can
be written 
\begin{equation}
w=\frac{p}{\rho }=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^{2}-V}{\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}%
^{2}+V}.
\end{equation}
The choice to remove just a kinetic term, as in \cite{Albrecht:2002xs}, from
the Friedman equation corresponds to having matter contributing to $\rho $
with $w=1$, which leads to $q=6$ and therefore agreement between equations (%
\ref{da}) and (\ref{dak}). This, then, indicates that an entropy bound of
the form (\ref{da}) (or (\ref{dak})) should be viewed as a bound on the
entropy contained in the matter \textit{within} the horizon.

\section{Conclusions}

\bigskip

It seems difficult to find clear cut implications of holography in the
context of inflation. As advocated in, e.g., \cite{Easther:1999gk}\cite
{Veneziano:1999ts}\cite{Kaloper:1999tt}, holography does not seem to say
anything more than an appropriate use of the generalized second law of
thermodynamics. Furthermore, the latter, in its physical consequences, is
always a consequence of using standard laws of general relativity and field
theory in a proper way.

To get truly new physics one seems to need more than just a counting of the
degrees of freedom. One such possibility would be to study the concept of
horizon complementarity in a cosmological setting. In the black hole case,
complementarity has been used to resolve the black hole information paradox 
\cite{Susskind:1993if}\cite{Susskind:1993ki}\cite{Susskind:1993mu}\cite
{Susskind:1995qc}. According to complementarity the same physics will look
very different from the point of view of a local observer and from the point
of view of FRW-coordinates. (Actually, one would need to wait until
inflation is over to make real measurements relevant to these coordinates.)
We have already seen how coarse graining and entropy necessarily will be
treated in different ways. While objects passing out through the horizon do
not experience anything dramatic from the point of view of \
FRW-coordinates, the local observer will see how the object experiences
effectively higher and higher temperatures as the horizon is approached, and
eventually observe how the object is boiled to pieces and thermalized. Could
these phenomena, and the way complementarity makes the different pictures
compatible, lead to detectable effects? In \cite{Danielsson:2002td} it is
argued that Poincare recurrences play an important role in resolving
possible paradoxes in a universe where inflation ends. Unfortunately the
analysis also shows that the time scales of inflation make it unlikely that
anything of this will be relevant for observable physics. It would, however,
be interesting to push these ideas further.

Another approach to finding effects of quantum gravity through inflation, is
to use its ability to magnify small scale physics to cosmological scales. In
particular one could hope that subtleties in how the effective initial
conditions for the inflaton are chosen by high energy physics could leave a
detectable imprint on the CMBR. These ideas have been investigated in
several recent works, see \cite{Brandenberger:2002sr}\cite{kinney2003} for
reviews. In order to have any chance of finding something detectable, the
scale of new physics can not be higher than the GUT-scale at $10^{16}$ GeV,
see \cite{Bergstrom:2002yd} for a detailed analysis, which happen to
coincide with the string scale in many realistic heterotic string theories.
One might also speculate that holography would provide a new scale. These
kind of ideas were pursued in \cite{Cohen:1998zx} in an attempt to
understand the cosmological constant in the present universe, but it is easy
to apply their ideas to an inflationary scenario. An obvious way to find a
holographic scale is simply to say that the highest energy scale where field
theory make sense, is limited through $r^{3}\Lambda ^{3}\sim \frac{r^{2}}{%
l_{p}^{2}}$, which leads to an energy scale a bit below Planck scale, that
is, $\Lambda \sim \left( \frac{l_{p}}{r}\right) ^{1/3}\frac{1}{l_{p}}$. In 
\cite{Cohen:1998zx} it was argued that the limit can be improved by
observing that $\Lambda $ should be limited by the highest entropy that you
can have with out forming a black hole. That is, $r^{3}\Lambda ^{3}\sim
\left( \frac{r^{2}}{l_{p}^{2}}\right) ^{3/4}$. This leads to a
characteristic scale given by $\Lambda \sim \left( \frac{l_{p}}{r}\right)
^{1/2}\frac{1}{l_{p}}$. (This is actually the temperature of a gas with an
energy density equal to the cosmological constant.) Using the largest
possible value of $H$, around $10^{14}$ GeV, one finds $\Lambda \sim 10^{16}$
GeV, which is, indeed, a potentially interesting energy scale.\footnote{%
This is the same scale as was argued for in \cite{Albrecht:2002xs} using a
different interepretation than in the present paper of the results in
section 4.} Unfortunately it is difficult to give a firm argument for why
this is a relevant limit. It remains, therefore, a challenge to find
non-trivial limits on inflationary physics imposed by holography.
