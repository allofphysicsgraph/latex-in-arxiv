\item D9-\Dbar9 pair. In this case, the tachyon field is
  always present and the annihilation happens rapidly.  Also since the
  branes are coincident, there is no inflaton.
\item D1-\Dbar1 pair. Since they do not span the 3
  uncompactified dimensions, they do not provide the necessary
  inflation.  In the presence of inflation (generated by other pairs),
  a density of these D$1$-branes will be inflated away.
\item D(3-\Dbar3)$_0$ pair. They span the 3 uncompactified 
  dimensions and move towards each other inside the volume of the
  6 compactified dimensions during inflation. (The conservation of 
  the total zero RR charge prevents them from becoming parallel and 
  so BPS with respect to each other.) At the end of
  inflation, their collision heats the universe and yields D1$_0$-branes
  as vortex-like solitons. These D1$_0$-branes appear as cosmic
  strings. They form a gas of D1$_0$-branes (at all possible
  orientations in the 3-dimensional uncompactified space).  The
  D3$_0$-branes are unstable in the presence of the D5$_1$ and D5$_2$
  branes. It is possible that during inflation, the D3$_0$-brane can
  simply move towards a D5-brane and then dissolve into it. 
  The \Dbar3$_0$-brane can either hit the same D5-brane 
  ending inflation, producing
  D1$_0$-branes as cosmic strings, or it can collide with another
  D5-brane. This D5-brane shall no longer be BPS with respect to the 
  other D5-branes and more inflation may result from their
  interactions.  Towards the end of inflation these D5-branes collide
  with the BPS D5-branes.  D1$_0$-branes are expected to be produced as
  defects in this scenario.
\item D5$_1$-\Dbar5$_1$ pair.  This D5$_1$ brane is indistinguishable
  from the other D5$_1$-branes that are present.  They span the 3
  uncompactified dimensions and move towards each other inside the
  volume of the 4 compactified dimensions (\emph{i.e.}~(6789)) during 
  inflation. Towards
  the end of inflation, a tachyon field appears and its rolling
  produces D3$_1$ branes as cosmic strings. However such D3$_1$ branes 
  are unstable and eventually a tachyon field (an open string mode 
  between the D3- and the D5-branes) will emerge. Its rolling 
  signifies the dissolution of the D3-brane into the D5$_1$
  branes. Generically, by the time these D3-branes start dissolving,
  (re)heating of the universe should have taken place, so the tachyon
  rolling can thermally produce D1$_0$-branes as cosmic strings.
\item D5$_3$-\Dbar5$_3$ pair.  They may generate inflation 
  directly, and being mutually BPS with the D5$_1$ and D5$_2$ branes 
  shall not be subject to more complicated interactions.  After
  inflation, D3$_3$-branes as cosmic strings 
  will be produced.  Although they are not BPS with respect to the
  D5-branes, the interaction is repulsive (with $p=$5, $p^\prime$=3 
  and $a=$2 in Eq.(\ref{vpot})), so we expect them to move away from 
  the D5$_1$-branes in the (67) directions (to the anti-podal point) and 
  from the D5$_2$-branes in the (45) directions. This
  way, these D3$_3$-branes shall mostly survive and evolve into a cosmic
  string network. However, some of the D3$_3$-branes will scatter with 
  the D5-branes in the thermal bath. This may also result in the 
  production of some D1$_0$-branes as cosmic strings.
\item D7$_{1,3}$-\Dbar7$_{1,3}$ pair.  To provide the needed
  inflation, these pairs wrap 4 of the 6 compactified dimensions and
  move towards each other in the remaining 2 compactified dimensions
  during the inflationary epoch. Their collision heats the universe
  and yields D5$_{1,3}$-branes as cosmic strings.  The D5-branes that
  wrap only 2 of the 4 wrapped dimensions of the D7 branes may appear
  to simply span all 3 uncompactified dimensions.
  However, the production of these objects is severely suppressed
  since the Hubble size is much bigger than the typical
  compactification sizes. While the tachyon is falling down, the
  universe is still cold, so no thermal production is possible
  either. As a result, only D5$_{1,3}$-branes that appear as cosmic
  strings are produced.

  It is possible for the D5$_1$-branes to dissolve into magnetic flux
  on the D7-brane during inflation.  After the annihilation of the
  D7$_{1,3}$-\Dbar7$_{1,3}$ pair, this flux shall reemerge as 
  D5-branes, together with any additional D5-branes solitons as cosmic
  strings.
\item D7$_{1,2}$-\Dbar7$_{1,2}$ pair.  This case is similar to the
  above case, except both sets of D5-branes may dissolve into the D7
  pair during inflation.
