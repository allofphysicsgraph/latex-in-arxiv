In this paper we present a covariant quantization of the
``massive'' spin-$2$ field on de Sitter (dS) space. By ``massive''
we mean a field which carries a specific principal series
representation of the dS group. The work is in the direct
continuation of previous ones concerning the scalar, the spinor
and the vector cases. The quantization procedure,  independent of
the choice of the coordinate system, is based on the
Wightman-G\""arding axiomatic and on analyticity requirements for
the two-point function in the complexified pseudo-Riemanian
manifold. Such a construction is necessary in view of preparing
and comparing with the dS conformal spin-$2$ massless case (dS
linear quantum gravity) which will be considered in a forthcoming
paper and for which specific quantization methods are needed.
