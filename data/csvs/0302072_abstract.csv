We study the process of compactification as a topology change. It
is shown how the mediating spacetime topology, or cobordism, may
be simplified through surgery. Within the causal Lorentzian
approach to quantum gravity, it is shown that any topology change
in dimensions $\geq 5$ may be achieved via a causally continuous
cobordism. This extends the known result for $4$ dimensions.
Therefore, there is no selection rule for compactification at the
level of causal continuity. Theorems from surgery theory and
handle theory are seen to be very relevant for understanding
topology change in higher dimensions. Compactification via
parallelisable cobordisms is particularly amenable to study with
these tools.
