\item The continuous representations. There are two series of continuous
representations and the series are
labeled by the discrete parameter $\epsilon \in {\{} 0,\frac{1}{2} {\}}$
which indicates the parity of the representation.
We denote them by $C^{\epsilon}_{-\frac{1}{2}+i s}$ where
$s$ is real and the quadratic Casimir $c_2$ takes the
values $c_2 = \frac{1}{4}+s^2$ (or $c_2 = -\tau(\tau+1)$ where
$\tau=-\frac{1}{2}+i s$ in perhaps more familiar notation).
These representations have a spectrum for a normalized elliptic generator
$J^{ell}= T^0$ that is either all integers, for $\epsilon=0$, or all
half-integers, for $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$. (See figure \ref{sl2rladders}.)
\item The true discrete representations. There are again two 
series, which are lowest weight representations and highest
weight representations. These are denoted $D^{+}_{\tau}$ or
$D^{-}_{\tau}$ respectively. The index $\tau$ takes the
values $\tau \in {\{} -1, -\frac{3}{2}, -2 ,\dots {\}}$, and 
the quadratic Casimir is again $c_2= -\tau (\tau+1)$.
The spectrum for the elliptic generator is given by $-\tau+n$
where $n$ is a positive integer (or zero) for the $D^{+}_{\tau}$
representation and $\tau-n$ for the $D^{-}_{\tau}$ representation.
(See figure \ref{sl2rladders}.)
\item The mock discrete representations. There are two of these,
namely $D^{\pm}_{-\frac{1}{2}}$ with spectra similar to the
ones described for the true discrete series.
(See figure \ref{sl2rladders}.)
\item The  complementary representations. These have $-1<\tau<0$
and $\tau \neq \frac{1}{2}$. They are of even parity.
