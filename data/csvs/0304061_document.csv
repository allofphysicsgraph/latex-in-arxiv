\begin{abstract}

We consider four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge
theories with gauge group $U(N)$ on $R^3 \times S^1$, in the
presence of a classical superpotential. The low-energy quantum
superpotential is obtained by simply replacing the adjoint scalar
superfield in the classical superpotential by the Lax matrix of
the integrable system that underlies the 4d field theory. We
verify in a number of examples that the vacuum structure obtained
in this way matches precisely that in 4d, although the degrees of
freedom that appear are quite distinct. Several features of 4d
field theories, such as the possibility of lifting vacua from
$U(N)$ to $U(tN)$, become particularly simple in this framework.
It turns out that supersymmetric vacua give rise to a reduction of
the integrable system which contains information about the field
theory but also about the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model. The
relation between the matrix model and the quantum superpotential
on $R^3\times S^1$ appears to involve a novel kind of mirror
symmetry.

\section{Introduction}

The dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories mimics in many ways that
of ordinary QCD, allowing for instance for confinement and chiral symmetry
breaking. Therefore, if we would have exact control over supersymmetric
theories, we could imagine describing non-supersymmetric gauge theories
as a perturbation away from a supersymmetric point, rather than as a perturbation
around a free field theory. In view of the qualitative similarity of the
low-energy dynamics, such a description could be much better behaved than ordinary
perturbation theory. In addition, there are several indications that
supersymmetry will be restored at sufficiently high energies, and this
provides ample motivation for the study of supersymmetric gauge theories.

As a first step towards the complete understanding of supersymmetric gauge
theories, one would like to understand their vacuum structure. A simple
organizing principle to describe the vacuum structure, low-energy gauge
couplings and correlation functions of chiral operators was given by Dijkgraaf
and Vafa in \cite{dva,dvb,dv}. This organizing principle involves a matrix model
which is obtained from the classical superpotential by reducing it to
its zero modes. The sum over the planar diagrams of the matrix model computes
the quantum superpotential as a function of gluino condensate superfields
$S_i$, one for each semisimple gauge group factor that is left unbroken
by a choice of minimum of the classical superpotential. Though this result
was originally derived using topological string theory, one can give
a proof of it directly in perturbation theory \cite{dv2}, or alternatively
using the Konishi anomaly \cite{cdsw}.

The matrix model, which was originally found for a pure ${\cal N}=2$
theory deformed by a superpotential ${\rm Tr} \,W(\Phi)$,
has been successfully generalized to a variety of other
supersymmetric gauge theories. There are, however, still several
conceptual questions that remain. One of these is whether and why
the gluino condensate superfields play such a distinguished role. It is
true, as has been elaborated in \cite{cdsw}, that they effectively control
the complete chiral ring of the gauge theory, but whether they are also
the sufficient and appropriate degrees of freedom for a full low-energy
effective description remains unknown. The precise reason for the
appearance of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential
$\sim S \log S - c S$ \cite{vy} remains somewhat mysterious as well,
though in the matrix model it can be interpreted in terms of the measure.
Another question is whether the matrix model approach, or a suitable modification
thereof, is applicable to all possible gauge theories with all possible matter
content. One may also wonder whether the integrable system that underlies
the matrix model has any relation to the integrable system that underlies
$N=2$ gauge theories \cite{is1,is2,is3}.

In an attempt to shed light on some of these issues, we consider in this
paper pure ${\cal N}=2$ theories with superpotential ${\rm Tr} \,W(\Phi)$
compactified on a circle with radius $R$. The integrable system that underlies
the four-dimensional theory becomes much more prominent once the theory
is compactified on a circle, and in addition the low-energy degrees
of freedom are quite distinct. Therefore, we should obtain an interesting
perspective on the matrix model results by compactifying the four-dimensional
theories.

The compactification of the pure ${\cal N}=2$ $U(N)$ theory was discussed in
detail in \cite{sw3}. Recall that in four dimensions there is a $2N$-dimensional
moduli space, and at each point in the moduli space there is an
auxiliary Riemann surface known as the Seiberg-Witten curve 
\cite{sw,sw2,swn1,swn2} (for
a review see e.g. \cite{swrev1,swrev2,swrev3}). The low-energy gauge couplings are
given by the periods of the Seiberg-Witten curve, or in other words by
the complex structure of the Jacobian of the curve, which is a $2N$-dimensional
torus. Once the theory is compactified, the moduli space becomes
$4N$-dimensional. The extra moduli come from the four-dimensional gauge field.
The component of the gauge field along the circle is a scalar from the
three-dimensional point of view, and the remaining 3d gauge field can
be dualized to a second scalar. Thus, each $U(1)$ gauge field gives rise
to two real scalars, that combine into one chiral superfield. The expectation
values of these scalars provide the extra moduli. Since the low-energy
gauge couplings were given by the complex structure of the Jacobian,
it should come as no surprise that the moduli space of the compactified
theory is obtained by adding to each point in
the moduli space of the uncompactified theory
the Jacobian of the associated Seiberg-Witten curve. Altogether the moduli
space is a $4N$-dimensional hyperK\""ahler manifold. According to \cite{sw3},
it has a distinguished complex structure that is independent of the
radius $R$ of the circle. Therefore, after including a superpotential,
the holomorphic data (such as the value of the superpotential and
the vacuum structure) will be independent of the radius $R$. This crucial
fact shows that we should be able to recover the four-dimensional
results directly for finite $R$, without the need to take the limit
$R\rightarrow \infty$.

In several ways, life simplifies in the presence of a circle. First of all, 
the non-perturbative dynamics of the three-dimensional theories we consider here
does not involve fractional
instantons, but only regular 3d instantons (which are monopoles
from the 4d point of view). Second of all, there are no degrees of freedom
that become light anywhere on the moduli space. In four dimensions, there
are massless monopoles and dyons on the moduli space, and these play a
crucial role in the quantum physics. In the presence of a superpotential,
some of these degrees of freedom condense, and this mechanism is responsible
for the existence of supersymmetric vacua \cite{sw,fs,bo}. Once the compact
circle is introduced, there are no such massless degrees of freedom for the theories
we consider, and
we therefore expect that the classical superpotential is actually identical
to the quantum superpotential. The only issue is to find the right variables
in which to express the superpotential. These variables are provided by
the underlying integrable system, which in the case of $U(N)$ is the periodic
Toda chain, and whose phase space coincides with the moduli space of the
unperturbed theory. Indeed, we will find that if the classical superpotential
is ${\rm Tr}\,W(\Phi)$, the quantum superpotential is simply ${\rm Tr}\,W(M)$,
with $M$ the Lax matrix of the integrable system, if the order of $W$ is
not too large. This was first conjectured in \cite{dorey1}, where
it is also shown that this correctly produces several 4d vacua in the
case of a mass deformation of the 4d $N=4$ theory, and it was
explained intuitively in \cite{dorey2}. The validity of this conjecture
for massive (i.e. maximally confining) vacua for theories with higher
order superpotentials was demonstrated in \cite{dorey3}.

In this paper we will analyze the minima and other properties
of the quantum superpotential ${\rm Tr}\,W(M)$ for arbitrary
superpotentials $W$ and gauge groups $U(N)$. We will consider both
massless and massive vacua. We will find that the vacuum structure
is in complete agreement with the results obtained in four dimensions,
in a series of examples. A general proof, using the integrable hierarchy
of the periodic Toda chain, will be described in a separate publication
\cite{toappear}. Several features of the 4d theory have a simple
interpretation on $R^3 \times S^1$. Massive vacua correspond to
simple degenerate Lax matrices, lifting vacua from $U(N)$ to
$U(tN)$ corresponds to applying a simple replica procedure to the
Lax matrix, etc. We also discuss the semiclassical expansion on
$R^3 \times S^1$, and the interpretation of the gluino condensate
superfields. The combination $\sum_i S_i $ has a simple interpretation
as a Lagrange multiplier in three dimensions, but the interpretation
of the individual $S_i$ remains unclear, and seems to involve a new version
of mirror symmetry.

The outline of this paper is as follows.
In section~2 we discuss some background material, such as general
properties of $N=2$ theories in three dimensions, and
the vacuum structure in the absence and presence of a superpotential.
In section~3 we describe the general conjecture and explain qualitatively
why we expect it to be correct. In section~4 we discuss several examples
and show that there is perfect agreement with the results obtained in
four dimensions. In section~5 we discuss the semiclassical expansion,
and in section~6 the relation with the integrable hierarchy of the
periodic Toda chain. Supersymmetric minima determine a specific reduction
of the hierarchy that is remarkably similar to the four-dimensional
field theory expressions, and at the same time remarkably similar to
the integrable system that underlies the Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model.
In section~7 we discuss the interpretation of the gluino bilinear superfields
$S_i$, and finally we present some puzzles and open problems.

\section{Field theory background material}

\subsection{${\cal N}=2$ theories in $d=4$}

A pure ${\cal N}=2$ theory with gauge group $U(N)$ in four dimensions
has as bosonic fields a scalar field $\Phi$
transforming in the adjoint representation which is part of an ${\cal N}=1$
hypermultiplet, and a gauge field $A_{\mu}$ which is part of an ${\cal N}=1$
vector multiplet. In a classical minimum of the scalar potential we can always diagonalize
$\Phi$,
\begin{equation} \label{defphi}
\Phi = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} \phi_1 & & 0 \\
 & \ddots & \\ 0 & & \phi_N \end{array} \right) .
\end{equation}
Such a value of $\Phi$ generically breaks the $U(N)$ gauge group to
$U(1)^N$, but the Weyl group $S_N$ also remains unbroken. Because
of the action of the Weyl group, only symmetric polynomials in the $\phi_i$
are gauge invariant objects, and as a basis of these polynomials we
can choose either ${\rm Tr}(\Phi^i)$ with $i=1,\ldots,N$, or alternatively
the coefficients in the characteristic polynomial,
\begin{eqnarray} \label{defP}
P_N(x) & \equiv & \det (x - \Phi) \nonumber \\
 & \equiv & x^N + s_1 x^{N-1} + \ldots s_N .
\end{eqnarray}
Classically, the moduli space is parametrized by the values of the $s_i$, and
generically the gauge group is broken to $U(1)^N$, but at special points
some of the non-abelian gauge symmetry is restored. The quantum theory was
first understood for $SU(2)$ in the famous paper of Seiberg and Witten
\cite{sw}, and later generalized to and studied for many other gauge
theories \cite{sw2,swn1,swn2}. 
For a review see e.g. \cite{swrev1,swrev2,swrev3}. It turns out that the
quantum moduli space is still parametrized by complex coordinates $s_i$,
but there are no longer points where a non-abelian gauge symmetry is
restored. Instead, there are special points in the moduli space where
dyons and/or monopoles can become massless. For each point on the moduli
space one can define an auxiliary curve, the Seiberg-Witten curve,
given by
\begin{equation} \label{swcurve}
y^2 = P^2_N(x) - 4 \Lambda^{2N}
\end{equation}
whose periods determine the gauge couplings of the low-energy effective
theory. The curve (\ref{swcurve}) describes a double cover of the complex
$x$-plane, with $\Lambda$ the dynamically generated scale of the ${\cal N}=2$
theory. The classical limit corresponds to taking the limit
$\Lambda\rightarrow 0$. The curve (\ref{swcurve}) has a Jacobian $T^{2N}$,
which is a complex torus with period matrix $\tau_{ij} = \int_{B_i} \omega_j$,
where $A_i,B_i$ is a standard basis of one-cycles
on the curve, and $\omega_i$ form basis of holomorphic one-forms normalized
so that $\int_{A_i} \omega_j = \delta_{ij}$.
Massless monopoles and/or dyons appear whenever the curve (\ref{swcurve})
degenerates, i.e. some of the one-cycles collapse.

\subsection{${\cal N}=1$ deformations in $d=4$}

Next, we consider what happens when we add a superpotential
\begin{equation}
\int d^4 x d^2 \theta {\rm Tr}\, W(\Phi)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
W(\Phi) = \sum_{m=0}^n \frac{g_{m+1}}{m+1} \Phi^{m+1}
\end{equation}
some polynomial of the superfield $\Phi$. Classically, the equation
\begin{equation} \label{wpri}
W'(\Phi) \equiv g_{n+1}(\Phi-a_1)(\Phi-a_2)\ldots(\Phi-a_n) = 0,
\end{equation}
must hold and therefore each of the eigenvalues $\phi_i$ of $\Phi$ in equation (\ref{defphi})
needs to be equal to one of the $a_j$. Thus the moduli space is reduced to
a finite set of points, where at least a $U(1)^N$ gauge symmetry remains
unbroken. More precisely, if $a_i$ is occupied $N_i$ times, in other words
$N_i$ of the $\phi_j$ are equal to $a_i$, then the gauge symmetry is broken
to
\begin{equation}
U(N) \longrightarrow U(N_1) \times \ldots \times U(N_n) .
\end{equation}

In the quantum theory, the pure ${\cal N}=1$ theories with gauge group
$U(N_i)$ that appear classically confine, a nonzero gluino condensate
$\langle \lambda \lambda \rangle \neq 0$ appears, and the gauge group is
broken to $U(1)$ (for $N_i>0$). One can also show that necessarily some
monopoles/dyons in the ${\cal N}=2$ theory have to condense. Thus the breaking
pattern of the gauge symmetry is
\begin{equation} \label{gbreak}
U(N) \stackrel{{\rm classical}}{\longrightarrow}
U(N_1) \times \ldots \times U(N_n) \stackrel{{\rm quantum}}{\longrightarrow}
U(1)^k
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the number of $N_i$ that are not equal to zero.

There are several approaches known in the literature to understanding 
the quantum theory. The first studies use Seiberg duality \cite{sd1,sd2}.
The precise structure of the vacua can be obtained 
using a brane construction \cite{bo}, one can use pure field theory
methods \cite{bo,csw,civ}, one can use Calabi-Yau geometry and geometric
engineering \cite{civ}, one can use matrix models \cite{dva,dvb,dv} and one
can use the generalized Konishi anomaly \cite{cdsw}. For our purposes,
we will be mainly interested in a comparison to the vacuum structure as
obtained using field theory methods. The field theory results can be
summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, express the quantities ${\rm Tr}(\Phi^{m+1})$ in terms of
the $s_i$ that appear in (\ref{defP}).
\item Next, determine the submanifold of the ${\cal N}=2$ theory on
which there are at least $N-k$ mutually local massless monopoles/dyons. On this
submanifold, the Seiberg-Witten curve degenerates and can be written in
the form
\begin{equation} \label{pcollapse}
y^2 = P_N^2(x)- 4 \Lambda^{2N} = H^2_{N-k}(x) T_{2k}(x)
\end{equation}
for some polynomials $H,T$ of degrees $N-k$, $2k$ respectively. As can
be seen from (\ref{pcollapse}), $N-k$ one-cycles have collapsed.
\item Minimize the classical superpotential, expressed in terms of the $s_i$,
on this submanifold. The resulting extrema are the quantum vacua.
\item One can then show that the quantum vacua are in one-to-one
correspondence with points on the moduli space where in addition to
(\ref{pcollapse}) we also have
\begin{equation} \label{wcollapse}
G^2_{n-k}(x) T_{2k}(x) = W'(x)^2 + f_{n-1}(x)
\end{equation}
for some polynomials $G,f$ of degrees $n-k,n-1$, and where $T$ is the same
polynomial that appears in (\ref{pcollapse}). Equation (\ref{wcollapse}) can
be viewed as a degeneration of the matrix model curve.
\item Finally, we need to check that the classical limit
of $P_N(x)$ is indeed $\prod_i (x-a_i)^{N_i}$, so that it indeed is a quantum
vacuum corresponding to the appropriate classical vacuum.
\end{enumerate}

For future reference, we also briefly summarize the matrix model approach
of \cite{dv}. Their construction starts with the matrix integral
\begin{equation}
\int d\Phi e^{-\frac{1}{g^2} {\rm Tr}\, W(\Phi)}.
\end{equation}
The symbol $\Phi$ now denotes an $M\times M$ matrix. Next we consider the planar
diagrams in perturbation theory around a classical minimum where
$U(M)\rightarrow U(M_1) \times \ldots \times U(M_n)$. The free energy, 
that is the sum of the connected planar diagrams, is a function of
the $M_i$ and denoted by ${\cal F}(M_1,\ldots,M_n)$. Next, we replace
$gM_i$ by $S_i$ to construct a function ${\cal F}(S_1,\ldots,S_n)$.
With this definition of ${\cal F}$ the quantum superpotential 
for the ${\cal N}=1$ theory with classical superpotential $W$ in a 
minimum where classically $U(N)$ is broken to $U(N_1)\times \ldots
\times U(N_n)$ is then
\begin{equation} \label{wdv}
W_{\rm eff}  = \sum_i N_i \frac{\partial {\cal F}}{\partial S_i} + \tau 
  \sum_i S_i  .
\end{equation}
The $S_i$ are superfields whose lowest components are the gaugino condensates
${\rm Tr}_{U(N_i)}(\lambda\lambda)$. This quantum superpotential controls
the complete chiral ring of the ${\cal N}=1$ theory and contains in that
sense more information then the field theory result given above. The
field theory results only describe the minima of (\ref{wdv}) and
are therefore recovered by minimizing (\ref{wdv}) with respect to the $S_i$.

A subtlety in (\ref{wdv}) is the inclusion of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz
superpotential 
\begin{equation} \label{wvy}
W^{(N_i)}_{VY}(S_i) = S_i \left[ \log \left( \frac{\Lambda^{3N_i}}{S_i^{N_i}}
\right) + N_i \right] 
\end{equation}
for each of the classical unbroken gauge groups $U(N_i)$. 
This can be attributed to the measure in the matrix model.
 For a pure ${\cal N}=1$ superpotential, (\ref{wvy}) is the full
quantum superpotential and its minima are at $S=e^{2\pi i t/N} \Lambda^3$
with $t=0,\ldots,N-1$ and $W_{\rm min}=N\Lambda^3 e^{2\pi i t/N}$.

Having reviewed the situation in four dimensions, we now turn to 
compactifications to three dimensions. 

\subsection{${\cal N}=4$ theories in $d=3$}

Three-dimensional theories with ${\cal N}=4$ can be obtained by dimensionally
reducing four-dimensional theories with ${\cal N}=2$. The structure of the 
Coulomb branch of such theories was studied in detail 
in \cite{sw3}, and they exhibit a
rich set of physical phenomena such as mirror symmetry \cite{3dmirror}.
Under the dimensional
reduction, the four-dimensional vector field $A_{\mu}$ decomposes in one
scalar field $r$ and a three dimensional vector field $A_{\alpha}$. The 
three-dimensional vector can in turn be dualized to a second scalar via
$\partial_{\alpha} \sigma = \epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma} F^{\beta\gamma}$.
The two scalars combine into a complex scalar $z$, which is part of a 3d 
hypermultiplet. Thus, in three dimensions, the vector multiplet is dual
to a hypermultiplet. This duality can be performed directly in the
Lagrangian for abelian gauge groups (see e.g. \cite{bho}), but not
for non-abelian groups, similar to what happens with electric-magnetic
duality in four dimensions. If we dimensionally reduce from four to
three dimensions, $\sigma$ will be a periodic variable, but $r$ is
unconstrained. If we instead compactify on a circle to go from four
to three dimensions, both $r$ and $\sigma$ are periodic variables. 

Classically, the complex variable $z$ is $r+i\sigma$, and the action
only depends on $Z+\bar{Z}$, where $Z$ is the superfield with lowest component
$z$. In perturbation theory the action remains a function of $Z+\bar{Z}$ only,
but the relation between the vev of $z$, $r$ and $\sigma$ can become
quite complicated. The periodicity of $r$ and $\sigma$ is therefore not
always manifest in terms of $z$. For example, $z$ could be a coordinate
on a torus in Weierstrass form $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$, but the fact that
this is a torus is not manifest. Non-perturbatively, the action no
longer needs to be a function of $Z+\bar{Z}$, as instantons generate a 
non-trivial dependence on the zero mode of $\sigma$.

The compactification of a pure ${\cal N}=2$ theory on $R^3\times S^1$
yields a three-dimensional theory with a moduli space which is parametrized
by the vevs of $\phi$ and $z$. The gauge symmetry is broken everywhere
to $U(1)^N$, and both $\phi$ and $z$ are diagonal. The moduli space is
a hyperK\""ahler manifold of dimension $4N$, and contains the moduli
space of the four-dimensional theory that was parametrized only by
$\phi$. What we gain by going to three dimensions are the vevs of $z$,
and these parametrize a $2N$-torus, which can be identified with the
Jacobian of the Seiberg-Witten curve. According to \cite{sw3}, one
of the complex structures of the moduli space is independent of the
radius $R$, and this complex structure is the one that will be relevant
once we break to ${\cal N}=2$ in $d=3$. Since it is independent of
$R$, the vacuum structure we find in three dimensions should be directly
related to the vacuum structure in four dimensions.

\subsection{${\cal N}=2$ deformations in $d=3$}

In this section we consider what happens when we add a superpotential
\begin{equation}
\int d^3 x d^2 \theta {\rm Tr}\, W(\Phi)
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
W(\Phi) = \sum_{m=0}^n \frac{g_{m+1}}{m+1} \Phi^{m+1}.
\end{equation}

In four dimensions the gauge symmetry was broken according to
(\ref{gbreak}), and since the complex structure of the moduli
space did not depend on $R$, we expect that for every finite value
of $R$ this remains true. Therefore, we expect that the moduli space
collapses to a finite collection of tori of dimension $2k$.

One of the main questions that we would like to answer in this paper
is whether this is indeed true, and whether this can all be described using
a suitable low-energy effective superpotential that depends on a suitable
set of degrees of freedom. This can indeed be done, but to understand
the result we first need to review some aspects of nonperturbative physics
in three-dimensional gauge theories. 

Non-perturbative physics in three dimensions is due to three-dimensional
instantons, which from the four dimensional point of view are monopoles. 
They are classified by $\pi_2(U(N)/U(1)^N)={\mathbb{Z}}^{N-1}$. Indeed, for
each simple root there is a corresponding embedding $SU(2)\subset U(N)$, 
and for each such embedding there is a corresponding elementary monopole.
A general monopole configuration is therefore labeled by a set of integers
$\{n_1,\ldots,n_{N-1}\}$, counting the number of elementary monopole 
constituents. In a pure ${\cal N}=2$ theory in three dimensions,
one can count the number of gaugino zero modes in a general monopole
background using the Callias index theorem \cite{callias}, and one
finds that there are two zero modes only if one $n_i=1$ and all other
$n_j$ vanish. We need two fermionic zero modes in order to get a non-trivial
contribution to the superpotential, and therefore only the single elementary
monopoles contribute to superpotential. Their contribution can be explicitly evaluated and the final result for
the superpotential reads \cite{polyakov,daswadia,affleckharveywitten,katzvafa}
\begin{equation} \label{w3dq}
W_{\rm quantum} = e^{(Z_1-Z_2)/g_3^2} + e^{(Z_2-Z_3)/g_3^2} + \ldots +
 e^{(Z_{N-1}-Z_{N})/g_3^2}.
\end{equation}
Here, $Z_i$ represents the diagonal entries of $Z$, and in the exponents
one recognizes the simple roots of $U(N)$; $g_3$ is the three-dimensional
Yang-Mills coupling. The result (\ref{w3dq}) is exact, and shows runaway
behavior. In a sense, (\ref{w3dq}) is less subtle than the Veneziano-Yankielowicz
effective superpotential (\ref{wvy}), because (\ref{w3dq}) involves a sum
of ordinary instantons, and fractional instantons play no role. The situation
in the presence of matter is quite a bit more subtle and is discussed in
e.g. \cite{bho,ahiss}. 

\subsection{${\cal N}=2$ deformations on $R^3 \times S^1$}

Now we examine what happens if the $4d$ theory is put on $R^3 \times S^1$.
In addition to the monopoles that contributed to (\ref{w3dq}), there
is one more non-trivial gauge field configuration that contributes,
which is the Kaluza-Klein monopole. This is present due to the existence
of large gauge transformations along the $S^1$ \cite{leeyi}.

The KK monopole adds one extra contribution to (\ref{w3dq}), and it
becomes \cite{sw3,katzvafa}
\begin{equation}
\label{w3}
W_{\rm quantum}=e^{(Z_1-Z_2)/g_3^2} +\ldots +e^{(Z_{N-1}-Z_{N})/g_3^2} +
e^{-1/Rg_3^2} e^{(Z_N-Z_1)/g_3^2} .
\end{equation}
The three-dimensional answer is recovered by taking $R\rightarrow 0$,
whereas the decompactification limit is $R\rightarrow \infty$ while
keeping the dynamical scale
\begin{equation} \label{defL}
\Lambda^{3N}\equiv e^{-1/g_4^2} \equiv e^{-1/Rg_3^2}
\end{equation}
fixed.

In order to study the minima of (\ref{w3}), and in order to compare
to the results we will find later, we first introduce a different set
of variables
\begin{eqnarray}
y_1 & = & e^{(Z_1-Z_2)/g_3^2} \nonumber \\
& \vdots & \nonumber \\
y_{N-1} & = & e^{(Z_{N-1}-Z_{N})/g_3^2} \nonumber \\
y_0 & = & e^{-1/Rg_3^2} e^{(Z_N-Z_1)/g_3^2} .
\end{eqnarray}
The variables $y_i$ are not unconstrained but obey
\begin{equation} \label{constr}
\prod_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i = \Lambda^{3N}.
\end{equation}
To impose this constraint, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier field
$L$, and with this field the superpotential (\ref{w3}) can be rewritten
as
\begin{equation} \label{w3a}
W_{\rm quantum} = y_1 + \ldots + y_{N-1} +y_0 + L \log \left( \frac{\Lambda^{3N}}{
\prod_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i } \right) .
\end{equation}
The minima of (\ref{w3a}) are easily found, they are
\begin{equation} \label{w3min}
y_{i,{\rm min}} = L_{\rm min} = \Lambda^3 e^{2\pi i t/N}, \qquad
W_{\rm min} = N\Lambda^3 e^{2\pi i t/N}.
\end{equation}
Indeed, the dependence on $R$ has dropped out of (\ref{w3a}) and
(\ref{w3min}), and the results are identical to the results obtained
from the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential (\ref{wvy}). 

Before discussing the general case, we discuss the simplest deformation of 
an ${\cal N}=4$ theory to a ${\cal N}=2$ theory, namely by a mass term
$W(\Phi)= \frac{1}{2} m \Phi^2$. In the presence of such a mass term,
there is a pure ${\cal N}=2$ theory at low energies, whose 
scale $\tilde{\Lambda}$ is related to the high energy ${\cal N}=4$ 
scale $\Lambda$ via scale matching as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\Lambda^3} = m \Lambda^2 .
\end{equation}
If we substitute this in (\ref{w3a}), and redefine $y_i \rightarrow m y_i$,
the superpotential becomes
\begin{equation} \label{w3b}
W = m \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i + L \log \left( \frac{\Lambda^{2N}}{
\prod_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i } \right) .
\end{equation}
The extrema of this superpotential are as before, we merely made a change
of variables. The superpotential (\ref{w3b}) only contains gauge degrees
of freedom, but we could also have chosen to include the diagonal
entries of $\Phi$ in the superpotential. They would simply appear
through an extra mass term,
\begin{equation}
\label{w3mass}
W = m \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i + L \log \left( \frac{\Lambda^{2N}}{
\prod_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i } \right) + \frac{1}{2} m \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \phi_i^2.
\end{equation}
The minima of (\ref{w3mass}) are the same as before, as $\phi_i=0$ at the 
extremum. As we will see, (\ref{w3mass}) is literally the superpotential
we obtain if we evaluate $\frac{1}{2} m {\rm Tr} M^2$, with $M$ the Lax
matrix of the periodic Toda chain. In general, we will find a superpotential which is a function
of $y_i$ and $\phi_i$, where the $y_i$ are subject to $\prod y_i = \Lambda^{2N}$.

\section{The proposal}

We now turn to deformations involving a general superpotential
$\int d^4x d^2 \theta {\rm Tr} \, W(\Phi)$ on $R^3 \times S^1$. 
As explained in the introduction, since there are no new massless
degrees of freedom on the moduli space, all we need to do is
to figure out how to write the operators ${\rm Tr}(\Phi^m)$ in terms
of suitable holomorphic variables on the $4N$-dimensional hyperK\""ahler
moduli space of the unperturbed theory. The resulting expression should
be the low-energy effective quantum superpotential. 

To find these variables we need to use the fact that the moduli space
is at the same time the phase space of a (complexified) integrable system. 
This integrable system is the periodic Toda chain, and its relation
to the Seiberg-Witten curve and ${\cal N}=2$ theories in four dimensions
was found in \cite{is1,is2,is3}. The periodic Toda chain is described by
the Hamiltonian 
\begin{equation}
\label{todaham}
H = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N p_i^2 + \Lambda^2 e^{q_1-q_2} + \ldots +
\Lambda^2 e^{q_{N-1}-q_{N}} + \Lambda^2 e^{q_N-q_1}
\end{equation}
with coordinates $q_i$ and momenta $p_i$, and we introduced a parameter 
$\Lambda^2$
which will later be identified with a field theory scale. 
Notice the similarity of this
expression to that in (\ref{w3mass}). The dynamics described by the
Hamiltonian (\ref{todaham}) is integrable: there exists a Lax operator
$M(p_i,q_i)$, which is an $N\times N$ matrix and a function of coordinates
and momenta, such that the time evolution given by the Hamiltonian
(\ref{todaham}) can equivalently be described by the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{todaeq1}
\frac{\partial M}{\partial t} = [M,{\cal L}(M)].
\end{equation}
The linear operator ${\cal L}$ will be described in more detail in section~6.
One of the implications of (\ref{todaeq1}) is that the variables
$u_k = \frac{1}{k+1} {\rm Tr}(M^k)$ are constants of the equations of
motion. With further work \cite{olive} one can also show that they
Poisson commute. They provide a complete set of action variables and
generate commuting flows
\begin{equation} \label{commflow}
\frac{\partial M}{\partial t_k} = \{M,u_k\} = [M,{\cal L}(\frac{1}{k+1} M^k)]
\end{equation}
on the phase space. Thus, the phase space admits action-angle variables, and
the angle variables are linear in the variables $t_k$. The $t_k$ provide
a local set of coordinates on the Jacobian of the Seiberg-Witten curve,
and are closely related to gauge transformations (recall that the angular
coordinates that describe the Jacobian were obtained by dualizing the
gauge field). Therefore, it is in many ways natural to identify the
gauge invariant quantities $\frac{1}{k+1}{\rm Tr}(\Phi^{k+1})$ with the 
conserved quantities $u_k = \frac{1}{k+1} {\rm Tr}(M^k)$ of the dynamical
system. This is also what the original discussion of the role
of the integrable system in ${\cal N}=2$ theories in four dimensions 
implies \cite{is1,is2}. Therefore, we conjecture, following 
\cite{dorey1,dorey2,dorey3} that the quantum superpotential can be obtained from the classical one by the rule
\begin{equation}
\label{prop}
\int d^4 x d^2 \theta {\rm Tr}\,W(\Phi) \longrightarrow
\int d^4 x d^2 \theta {\rm Tr}\,W(M) ,
\end{equation}
with $M$ the Lax matrix of the integrable system. In order to
compare this to the field theory discussion in section~2, we need
to explain the relation between the coordinates and momenta
in (\ref{todaham}) and the field theory degrees of freedom that appeared
in our discussion in section~2. That can be done by comparing
the Hamiltonian (\ref{todaham}) to the superpotential (\ref{w3mass}).
According to (\ref{prop}), these two should be identified with each other.
Therefore, the momenta $p_i$ of the integrable system should naturally be
identified with the eigenvalues $\phi_i$ of the adjoint superfield $\Phi$
as in (\ref{defphi}). Furthermore, the variables $y_i$ can be identified
with $\Lambda^2 e^{q_i-q_{i+1}}$, where the indices on $q$ are 
identified modulo $N$. 

To make the statement in (\ref{prop}) more explicit, we
need to give the explicit form of the Lax matrix. It is given by
\cite{lax}
\begin{equation} \label{deflax}
M =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  p_1        &   \Lambda^2 e^{q_1-q_2}   &   0    & \dots & z         \\
   1            & p_2  &  \Lambda^2 e^{q_2-q_3}   & \dots & 0         \\
   0            &    1    & p_3 & \dots & 0         \\
   .            &    .    &  .     & \dots & \Lambda^2 e^{q_{N-1}-q_N}   \\
   e^{q_N-q_1} z^{-1} &    .    &  .     &   1   & p_N
 \end{pmatrix} \equiv
 \begin{pmatrix}
  \phi_1        &   y_1   &   0    & \dots & z         \\
   1            & \phi_2  &  y_2   & \dots & 0         \\
   0            &    1    & \phi_3 & \dots & 0         \\
   .            &    .    &  .     & \dots & y_{N-1}   \\
   y_{0} z^{-1} &    .    &  .     &   1   & \phi_N
 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
The parameter $z$ is a so-called spectral parameter. As long as the superpotential
does not contain higher powers than $N-1$, the superpotential is independent
of $z$. If we compute ${\rm Tr}(M^N)$, we find a $z$-dependent constant
that we simply drop. 
Higher powers can also be taken into account, but we defer that
discussion to section~6. 

Our final proposal is therefore that the quantum superpotential is given by
(\ref{prop}), with $M$ given by (\ref{deflax}). The $y_i$ are constrained
to satisfy $\prod y_i = \Lambda^{2N}$, but we will find it convenient
to keep the $y_i$ unconstrained in the Lax matrix $M$, and to impose the
constraint via a Lagrange multiplier term
\begin{equation} \label{defmult}
L \log\left( \frac{\Lambda^{2N}}{\prod_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i} \right) 
\end{equation}
in the superpotential.

The spectral curve associated to the Lax matrix $M$ is defined
by the equation 
\begin{equation} \label{defspec}
\det (x - M) \equiv P_N(x) + (-1)^N(z+\Lambda^{2N} z^{-1}) = 0.
\end{equation}
If we introduce a new variable $y=2 z + (-1)^N P_N(x)$, the spectral
curve becomes
\begin{equation}
y^2 = P_N(x)^2 - 4 \Lambda^{2N}
\end{equation}
which is exactly the same as the Seiberg-Witten curve
(\ref{swcurve}). Therefore, the quantities ${\rm Tr}(M^{k+1})$ provide
coordinates on the moduli space of the ${\cal N}=2$ theory in four
dimensions, and this provides further motivation for the proposal
(\ref{prop}). 

\subsection{Features of the proposal}

Before working our way through a list of examples, we mention some
general features of the superpotential (\ref{prop}). 

First of all, it is interesting to observe that the quantum superpotential
is simply obtained by substituting the Lax matrix in the classical superpotential.
No matrix models need to be solved. Perhaps this is a manifestation
of the observation that the superpotential of a $d$ dimensional gauge theory 
appears to require solving a $d-4$ dimensional auxiliary theory, as 
suggested in \cite{dv5}. A $-1$-dimensional theory indeed requires
no integrations whatsoever.

Another appealing feature of (\ref{prop}) is that it is polynomial in
$y_i$, and therefore the expansion in powers of $y$ corresponds to a
monopole expansion. In the classical limit where $\Lambda\rightarrow 0$,
all $y_i$ should also be taken to zero, and all non-perturbative
effects disappear. What is left is the classical superpotential expressed
as a function of the $\phi_i$. 

In the periodic Toda chain, the center of mass coordinate $\sum q_i$
does not appear, and as a consequence the variables $y_i$ are
not independent but satisfy $\prod_i y_i = \Lambda^{2N}$. This center
of mass coordinate corresponds to the $U(1)$ factor in $U(N)=U(1)\times SU(N)$, 
and this $U(1)$ is always left unbroken. It accordingly never appears
in the superpotential. The remaining $U(1)^{k-1}$ gauge symmetry that
is left unbroken (see (\ref{gbreak})) will emerge as $k-1$ free parameters
that are left after extremizing the superpotential. In other words, the 
superpotential will not have isolated vacua in general, but will
have moduli spaces of vacua of real dimension $2(k-1)$. It is easy to see
that the flows of the integrable system have to map extrema of the
superpotential into extrema. Therefore what should happen is
that $N-k$ of the flows leave the extremum invariant, while the
remaining $k-1$ flows generate the $k-1$ free complex parameters dual
to the unbroken $U(1)^{k-1}$. The gauge couplings of this unbroken
$U(1)^{k-1}$ can be extracted from the spectral curve, by studying 
the complex structure of the Jacobian of the spectral curve at the
extrema. 

The above picture is based on a comparison to the known results in 
four dimensions (see section~2.2), but we still need to show that this is indeed what happens. Intuitively, what happens is the following. The superpotential is a linear combination of action
variables, and correspondingly generates a flow on the moduli space.
In order for the superpotential to have an extremum, this flow needs
to have a stationary point. Since all flows are linear motions on
the Jacobian of the associated curve, this can only happen if the Jacobian
and Seiberg-Witten curve degenerate. What is not clear is why the existence
of a stationary point of a single flow should automatically 
imply that in fact $N-k$ flows are stationary at this point. Correspondingly,
$N-k$ one-cycles of the Seiberg-Witten curve should collapse, and
the Jacobian should degenerate to a $(k-1)$-dimensional complex torus.

The way in this happens is somewhat mysterious, and is best explained
in terms of the integrable Toda system. The relevant equations are 
summarized in section~6, but we defer a full proof of these statements
to a separate publication \cite{toappear}.

The Lagrange multiplier we introduced in (\ref{defmult}) is not just
there for technical convenience. It turns out that the expectation value
of $L$ in an extremum is identical to the value of the $U(N)$ gluino
bilinear superfield $S$ in the corresponding extremum in the four-dimensional
theory. This will be further discussed in section~7.

A last feature we would like to point out is that the Lax matrix is 
not invariant under general permutations, i.e. under the Weyl group
of $U(N)$. It is only form invariant under a ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ subgroup
of cyclic permutations of the $\phi_i$ and the $y_i$. A choice of
classical vacuum configuration corresponds to choosing each
$\phi_i$ equal to some $a_j$ (the solution of $W'(x)=0$, see
(\ref{wpri})), and all $y_i=0$. It is not guaranteed that all choices
of $\phi_i$ have a corresponding minimum of the quantum superpotential.
Because permutation symmetry is broken, it could be that one
needs to order the $\phi_i$ in a suitable way in order to find a 
minimum of the quantum theory. We will see that this is indeed what
happens. Precisely how one should order the eigenvalues in general
is an interesting open problem that we have not yet been able to
solve.

\section{Examples}

In this section we discuss in detail how our proposal works in various examples. For each of the classical vacua
that gives rise to a symmetry breaking pattern as in (\ref{gbreak}), we expect
to find $\prod_{N_i>0} N_i$ vacua, as each $U(N_i)$ low energy gauge group
has $N_i$ distinct quantum vacua. The various choices of vacua show
up as choices of phases in the solutions below. We will compare the results to
the four dimensional results as described in section~2.2.

\subsection{$U(2)$}

\label{sec:u2}

The first example that we will discuss is $U(2)$ with tree level
superpotential
\begin{equation}
W=g_1 \mathrm{tr}(\Phi) + \frac{g_2}{2} \mathrm{tr}(\Phi^2) + \frac{g_3}{3}
\mathrm{tr}(\Phi^3) .
\end{equation}
The Lax operator in this case reads
\begin{equation}
