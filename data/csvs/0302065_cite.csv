and $m_0$ is the rest energy of the particle, which in terms
of the invariant Casimir mass $m$, defined as

m^2=\k^2\left(\epe-2+\eme\right)-p^2\epe,
\ee
is given by
\be
\cosh\mk=1+{m^2\over2\k^2}.
\ee

Consider now a particle at rest in an inertial
frame, and derive from (\ref{LNt}) its energy $E$ and
momentum $p$ in a frame related to the first by a boost
of rapidity parameter $\x$:
\bea
&&\epe={\cosh\mks+\sinh\mks\cosh\x},\lb{LNe}\\
&&p={\sinh\mk\sinh\x\over\cosh\mk+\sinh\mk\cosh\x}.\lb{LNp}
\eea
From (\ref{LNe}), one can express $\cosh\x$ in terms of $E$
and $m_0$ \cite{AK,AA}:
\be
\cosh\x={\epe-\cosh\mk\over\sinh\mk}.
\ee

One can derive now the relation between the rapidity parameter
$\x$ and the velocity $v$ of the particle. If the velocity is
defined by the relation
$v_H={\de E\over\de p}$, one can obtain its expression
differentiating the mass-shell constraint (\ref{LNc}),
$p^2=\k^2\left(1-\eme\right)^2-m^2\eme$.
One has
\be
v_H={p\,\epe\over\k\left(\cosh\mk-\eme\right)},
\ee
and hence, from (\ref{LNe}) and (\ref{LNp})
\be\lb{LNv}
v_H={\cosh\mks+\sinh\mks\cosh\x\over\sinh\mk+\cosh\mk\cosh\x}\,\sinh\x.
\ee
Of course, inverting (\ref{LNv}) one obtains that the rapidity parameter
depends both on the velocity and the mass of the particle, leading to the
same problems as with the MS model.

Also in this case these problems can be avoided adopting a
different definition for the velocity of a particle.
Namely, one can adopt the right velocity introduced in \cite{THM,LN},
\be
v_R\id{v_H\over 1+{p\,v_H\over\k}}={p\,\epe\over\k\left(\epe-\cosh\mk\right)}.
\ee
After substituting (\ref{LNe}) and (\ref{LNp}), in fact, one obtains
\be
v_R=\tanh\x,\qquad\cosh\x={1\over\sqrt{1-v_R^2}},
\ee
which are again the classical relations, independent from the particle mass..

\section{Conclusions}
We have shown that in order to obtain a definite relation between
the relative velocity of two reference frames and the rapidity of
a boost relating them, one cannot define the velocity of a particle
of energy $E$ and momentum $p$ as $v={\de E\over\de p}$. A suitable
definition seems to be model-dependent (see however \cite{KM}),
but in the known cases always
satisfies the special relativistic relations, and in particular the
addition law of velocity \cite{Gr,LN}. Although this is of course a
sufficient condition for avoiding the problems discussed in this
paper, it does not appear to be also necessary in principle.

It is also interesting to notice that the correct definition of velocity
implies that the velocity of a massless particle is always equal
to $c$. In our opinion, this is a very basic prediction and we see no
reason for introducing a variable speed of light.
First of all, this would be at odds with the spirit of the model,
which is based on the existence of two invariant fundamental scales.
A more serious problem is that a variable speed of light would
destroy the causal structure of special relativity, leading to great
difficulties with the physical interpretation.

Of course, it would be useful to build a suitable hamiltonian
formalism that predicts the correct velocities. This seems to be
possible only if one uses deformed Poisson brackets and
noncommuting spacetime coordinates \cite{KG,LN,Gr}.
