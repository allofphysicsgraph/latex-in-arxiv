The nonlinear realization
of conformal $so(2,d)$ symmetry for relativistic
systems  and  the dynamical  conformal $so(2,1)$ symmetry
of nonrelativistic  systems
are investigated  in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.
We show that the massless particle
in $d$-dimensional Minkowski space can be treated
as the system confined to the border
of the AdS${}_{d+1}$ of infinite radius,
while various nonrelativistic systems
may be canonically related
to a relativistic
(massless, massive, or tachyon) particle
on the AdS${}_{2}\times$S${}^{d-1}$.
The list of nonrelativistic systems ``unified""
by such a correspondence comprises
the conformal mechanics model,
the planar charge-vortex and
$3$-dimensional
charge-monopole systems,
the particle in a planar
gravitational field of a point massive source,
and the conformal model associated with the charged
particle propagating near the horizon of the
extreme Reissner-Nordstr\""om
black hole.
