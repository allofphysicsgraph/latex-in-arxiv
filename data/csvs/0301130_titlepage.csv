\vskip 3pt \noindent 
We consider the entropy bounds recently conjectured by Fischler, Susskind and
Bousso, and proven in certain cases by Flanagan, Marolf and Wald 
(FMW).  One of the FMW derivations supposes a covariant form of the Bekenstein
entropy bound, the consequences of which we explore.  The derivation also
suggests that the entropy
contained in a vacuum spacetime, e.g.  Schwarzschild, is related to
the shear on congruences of null rays.  We find evidence for this intuition, 
but in a surprising
way.  We compare the covariant entropy bound
to certain earlier discussions of black hole entropy, and comment on the
separate roles of quantum mechanics and gravity in the entropy bound.
