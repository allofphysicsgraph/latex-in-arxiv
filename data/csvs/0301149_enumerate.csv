\item The expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor are covariantly conserved.
\item Causality holds.
\item In Minkowski spacetime, standard results should be obtained.
\item Standard results for the off-diagonal elements should also be obtained.
\item The energy-momentum tensor is a local functional of the metric, i.e. it depends only on
the metric and its derivatives which appear through the Riemann
curvature tensor.
