0,"\begin{theorem} Reflections of exterior points about exterior points
and about exterior lines are also motions of the projective--metric plane.
Hence, the $\Psi_{b}$'s for $b\in \mathcal{G}$ acting on exterior points
and exterior lines are motions of the hyperbolic projective--metric plane.

1,"\begin{theorem} \label{main}
Exterior point reflections generate any motion in the affine space. 
Moreover, since exterior points correspond to spacelike lines,
any motion in Minkowski 3-space is generated by reflections about
spacelike lines.

2,"\begin{theorem} \label{mainqft} Let $\omega$ and $\inet$ satisfy the
Standing Assumptions, and let the pair $(\Js,\{ J_i \}_{i \in I})$
fulfill Axioms A.1 -- A.6 in Section 2.1. Then there exists a
bijection $\chi : I \rightarrow \Ws$ such that 
$J_i \chi(j) = \chi(\tau_i(j))$, for all $i,j \in I$. The group $\Js$ 
forms an (anti-)unitary representation of the proper Poincar\'e group $\Ps_+$, 
wherein each $J_i$ represents the reflection about the spacelike line in 
$\RR^3$ which is the edge of the wedge $\chi(i)$.  Moreover, the bijection
$\chi$ can be chosen so that with $\Rs(\chi(i)) \equiv \Rs_{i}$, the
collection $\{ \Rs(\chi(i)) \}_{i \in I}$ forms a collection of von
Neumann algebras satisfying Haag duality which is covariant under this
representation of $\Ps_+$.

3,"\begin{theorem} \label{mainqft2} Let $\omega$ and $\inet$ satisfy the
Standing Assumptions, and let the pair $(\Js,\{ J_i \}_{i \in I})$
fulfill Axioms A.1 -- A.6 in Section 2.1. If the bijection 
$\chi : I \rightarrow \Ws$ from Theorem \ref{mainqft} is order-preserving, 
then $\{ \Rs(\chi(i)) \}_{i \in I}$ is a net of von Neumann algebras 
satisfying locality. Furthermore, the CGMA is satisfied by the pair 
$(\omega,\{ \Rs(\chi(i)) \}_{i \in I})$.
