\item The SL$(2,\R)\times$SU(2) content of the spectrum is the same in
the NS and RR cases, which is expected from S-duality.
\item As in the NS case, the two radii are equal.
\item Contrary to the NS case, where the common radius is equal to the
  radius of the bulk $AdS_3\times S^3$, the common radius in the RR
  case can take any value.

\item 
$\displaystyle p=-\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{S^2} d\theta\,d\phi\,F_{\theta\phi}$
is an integer because of Dirac quantization. It can be interpreted as
the D-string charge of the D3-brane.
\item The F-string charge should, of course, also be an integer; since
F-strings couple with the NS two-form, this charge reads
\begin{equation}
q = \frac{1}{T_F} 
    \int_{S^2} d\theta\,d\phi\,\frac{\delta S}{\delta B_{\omega\tau}} 
\equiv \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{S^2} d\theta\,d\phi\,{\tilde F}_{\theta\phi}\,;
\end{equation}
the explicit form of $\tilde F$ is given in the appendix.

2,"\begin{itemize}
\item The set of possible positions for the branes is discrete; in
particular, the $\chi_0$ parameter can have only a finite number of
values.
\item The fluctuations of the branes must be compatible with these
quantization conditions; this implies the stability of the branes (see
\cite{BDS}) and some restrictions on the spectrum.

\item $T_{D3}$ is replaced by $T_{D4}$.
\item $f\wedge f$ is replaced by $f\wedge f\wedge dx$.
\item More importantly, new terms are added inside the bracket:
\begin{equation}
L^2(\sin^2\chi_0+\sinh^2\psi_0)
\left[ -\frac{1}{2}(\d_x\delta_A\d^x\delta_A + \d_x\delta_S\d^x\delta_S)
  -\frac{1}{2}f_{mx}f^{mx} \right]\ .
