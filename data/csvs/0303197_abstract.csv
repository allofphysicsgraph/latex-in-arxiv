Standard-like models from  type IIA $\IT^6/(\IZ_2\times \IZ_2)$
orientifold with intersecting D6-branes. D6-branes can wrap
general  supersymmetric three-cycles of $\IT^6=\IT^2\times
\IT^2\times \IT^2$, and any  $\IT^2$ is allowed to be tilted. The
models still suffer from additional exotics, however  we obtained
solutions with fewer Higgs doublets,  as well as models with all
three families of  left-handed quarks and leptons arising from the
same intersecting  sector, and  examples of a genuine left-right
symmetric model  with three copies of  left-handed and
right-handed families of quarks  and leptons.
