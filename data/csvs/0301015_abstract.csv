We show how, modulo the distinction between the antipode and the
``twisted'' or ``renormalized'' antipode, Connes and Kreimer's
algebraic paradigm trivializes the proofs of equivalence of the
(corrected) Dyson--Salam, Bogoliubov--Parasiuk--Hepp and Zimmermann
procedures for renormalizing Feynman amplitudes. We discuss the
outlook for a parallel simplification of computations in quantum field
theory, stemming from the same algebraic approach.
