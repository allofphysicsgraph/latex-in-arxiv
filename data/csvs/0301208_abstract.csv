We investigate a gravitational model whose vacuum sector is invariant
under conformal transformations.  In this model matter
is taken to be coupled with a metric which is different
but conformally
related to the metric appearing explicitly in the vacuum sector.  It is then
shown that the effect of a conformal symmetry breaking would lead to a
particle concept.  In particular, a correspondence
between quantum nature of the particles and the gravitational interaction
of matter is established.
