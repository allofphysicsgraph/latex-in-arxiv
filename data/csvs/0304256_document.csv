\section{Introduction}
%
At present there is no understanding of the small size of the
cosmological constant which does not resort to an enormous
fine-tuning. (For a review of some of the main attempts, together
with a no-go theorem, see \cite{CCReview}.) The discomfort of the
theoretical community with this fact was recently sharpened by the
%S removed one recent
discovery of dark energy \cite{ccnonzero}, which can be
interpreted as being due to a very small, but nonzero, vacuum
energy which is of order $\rho = v^4$, with
%
\eq \label{expval}
    v \sim 3 \times 10^{-3} \; \hbox{eV} ,
\eeq
%
in units for which $\hbar = c = 1$.

Any fundamental solution to the cosmological constant problem must
answer two questions.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Why is the vacuum energy so small at the microscopic scales,
$M > M_w \sim 100 \, \hbox{GeV}$, at which the fundamental theory
is couched?
%
\item Why does it remain small as all the scales
between $M$ and $v$ are integrated out?
%
\end{enumerate}
%
Problem 2 has proven the thornier of these two, because in the
absence of a symmetry which forbids a cosmological constant,
integrating out physics at scale $M$ leads to a contribution to
the vacuum energy which is of order $M^4$. Thus, integrating out
ordinary physics which we think we understand --- for instance,
the electron --- already leads to too large a contribution to
$\rho$. Symmetries can help somewhat, but not completely. In four
dimensions there are two symmetries which, if unbroken, can forbid
a vacuum energy: scale invariance and some forms of supersymmetry.
However, both of these symmetries are known to be broken at scales
at least as large as $M_w$, and so do not seem to be able to
explain why $v \ll M_w$.

In this paper we propose six-dimensional supergravity with two
sub-millimeter extra dimensions as a potential solution to both
problems 1 and 2. Higher-dimensional supergravity theories are
natural to consider in this context because in higher dimensions
supersymmetry can prohibit a cosmological constant, and so they
provide a natural solution to problem 1 above. However higher
dimensions cannot help below the compactification scale, $M_c \sim
1/r$ where $r$ is the largest radius of an extra dimension, since
below this scale the effective theory is four-dimensional, which
is no help to the extent that $M_c \gg v$.

These considerations select out six-dimensional theories for
special scrutiny, because only for these theories can the
compactification scale satisfy $M_c \sim v$ --- corresponding to
$r \sim 0.1$ mm --- without running into immediate conflict with
experiment. The extra dimensions can be this large provided that
all experimentally-known interactions besides gravity are confined
to a (3+1)-dimensional surface (3-brane) within the six
dimensions, since in this case the extra dimensions are only
detectable through tests of the gravitational force on distances
of order $r$. The upper limit on $r$ provided by the absence of
deviations from Newton's Law in current experiments
\cite{GravBounds} is $r \lsim 0.1$ mm.

The decisive difference between sub-millimeter-scale 6D
supergravity and other higher-dimensional proposals is that it is
higher dimensional physics which applies right down to the low
scale $v$ at which the problem must be solved, as is necessary if
the proposal is to help with Problem 2. This is important because
in these models the vacuum energy generated by integrating out
ordinary particles is not a cosmological constant in the
six-dimensional sense, but is instead localized at the position of
the brane on which these particles live, contributing to the
relevant brane tension, $T$. We should therefore expect these
tensions to be at least of order $T \sim M_w^4$.

In this context Problem 1 above splits into two parts. 1A: Why
doesn't this large a brane tension unacceptably curve the space
seen by a brane observer? 1B: Why is there also not an
unacceptably large cosmological constant in the two-dimensional
`bulk' between the branes? Happily, both of these have simple
solutions in six dimensions. 1B can be solved because in six
dimensions supersymmetry itself can forbid a bulk cosmological
constant. 1A can be solved because the contribution of the
curvature in the extra dimensions due to the branes precisely
cancels the contribution of the tension itself, as has also been
remarked in refs.~\cite{rob,marcus,rugbyball,jim}.

This leaves as unsolved Problem 2: the question of integrating out
the scales from $M_w$ down to $v$ ({\it i.e.} quantum
corrections). We argue here that the relevant degrees of freedom
to integrate out are those in the bulk, which are all related to
the graviton by supersymmetry. Their couplings are therefore
naturally of gravitational strength, and so if supersymmetry
breaks on the branes at scale $M_w$, their supersymmetric mass
splittings are naturally of order $\Delta m \sim M_w^2/M_p \sim v$
\cite{susyADD}, with $M_p = (8 \pi G_4)^{-1/2} \sim 10^{18}$ GeV
denotes the 4D Planck mass, where $G_4$ is Newton's constant in
four dimensions. Their contributions to the effective 4D
cosmological constant are therefore naturally of order $(\Delta
m)^4$, which is of precisely the required size to describe the
observed Dark Energy.

There are other well-known virtues to six-dimensional theories
having $r$ this large. Any six-dimensional physics which would
stabilize $r$ at values of order 0.1 mm would also explain the
enormous hierarchy between $M_w$ and the Planck mass $M_p$
\cite{ADD}. It would do so provided only that the six-dimensional
Newton's constant, $M_6 = (8 \pi G_6)^{-1/4}$, is set by the same
scale as the brane physics, $M_6 \sim M_w$ because of the
prediction $M_p \sim M_6^2 \, r$. A particularly appealing feature
of this proposal is its prediction of detectable gravitational
phenomena at upcoming accelerator energies
\cite{realgraviton,susyADD,virtualgraviton,OpPollution}.

Astrophysical constraints can also constrain sub-millimeter scale
six-dimensional models, and in some circumstances can require $r
\lsim 10^{-5}$ mm \cite{SNProbs,susyADD}. These bounds are
somewhat more model dependent, however, and we take the point of
view that they are easier to circumvent through detailed
model-building than is the much harder problem of the cosmological
constant.

The rest of our discussion is organized as follows. The next
section contains a brief review of the six-dimensional
supergravity we shall use, and its supersymmetric compactification
on a sphere to four dimensions. This section also discusses how
the equations of motion change once branes are coupled to the bulk
supergravity fields. Section 3 describes the various contributions
to the effective four-dimensional vacuum energy. It first shows
how the various brane tensions generally cancel the classical
contributions to the bulk curvature, and also shows how
supersymmetry ensures the cancellation of all other bulk
contributions at the classical level. These cancellations relate
the effective 4D vacuum energy to the derivatives of the dilaton
at the positions of the various branes. We then estimate the size
of quantum corrections to the 4D cosmological constant, and argue
that these give contributions which are naturally of order
$1/r^4$. In Section 4 we construct the simplest kind of
supergravity solution including branes, which corresponds to two
branes located at the north and south poles of an internal
two-sphere. We show that the solution has constant dilaton, and so
vanishing classical effective 4D vacuum energy, if the branes do
not directly couple to the dilaton. In Section 5 we finish with
some conclusions as well as a discussion of some of the remaining
open issues.

\section{Six Dimensional Supergravity}
%
Six-dimensional supergravities come in several flavors, and we
focus here on a generalization of the Salam-Sezgin version of the
gauged six-dimensional supersymmetric Einstein-Maxwell system
\cite{MS,NS,SS}. The generalization we consider involves the
addition of various matter multiplets in order to cancel the
Salam-Sezgin model's six-dimensional anomalies. We choose this
model because we wish to construct an explicit brane configuration
which illustrates our general mechanism, and for reasons to be
made clear this 6D supergravity seems the best prospect for doing
so in a simple way. Our treatment follows the recent discussion of
this supergravity given in ref.~\cite{susysphere}.

\subsection{The Model}
%
The field content of the model consists of a supergravity-tensor
multiplet -- a metric ($g_{MN}$), antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field
($B_{MN}$ --- with field strength $G_{MNP}$), dilaton ($\varphi$),
gravitino ($\psi_M^i$) and dilatino ($\chi^i$) -- coupled to a
combination of gauge multiplets --- containing gauge potentials
($A_M$) and gauginos ($\lambda^i$) --- and $n_{\sss H}$
hyper-multiplets --- with scalars $\Phi^a$ and fermions
$\Psi^{\hat{a}}$. Here $i = 1,2$ is an $Sp(1)$ index, $\hat{a} =
1,\dots,2n_{\sss H}$ and $a = 1,\dots,4n_{\sss H}$, and the gauge
multiplets fall into the adjoint representation of a gauge group,
$G$. In the model we shall follow in detail the $Sp(1)$ symmetry
is broken explicitly to a $U(1)$ subgroup, which is gauged.

The fermions are all real Weyl spinors --- satisfying $\Gamma_7
\psi_M = \psi_M$, $\Gamma_7 \lambda = \lambda$ and $\Gamma_7 \chi
= - \chi$ and $\Gamma_7 \Psi^{\hat{a}} = - \Psi^{\hat{a}}$ --- and
so the model is anomalous for generic gauge groups and values of
$n_{\sss H}$ \cite{AGW}. These anomalies can sometimes be
cancelled {\it via} the Green-Schwarz mechanism \cite{GSAC}, but
only for specific gauge groups which satisfy specific conditions,
such as $n_{\sss H} = \hbox{dim}(G) + 244$ \cite{RSSS,6DAC}. We
need not specify these conditions in detail in what follows, but
for the purposes of concreteness we imagine using the model
of ref.~\cite{RSSS} for which $G = E_6 \times E_7 \times U(1)$,
having gauge couplings $g_6$, $g_7$ and $g_1$. The hyper-multiplet
scalars take values in the noncompact quaternionic K\""ahler
manifold ${\cal M} = Sp(456,1)/(Sp(456)\times Sp(1))$.

The bosonic part of the classical 6D supergravity action
is:\footnote{We follow Weinberg's metric and curvature conventions
\cite{GandC}.}
%
\eqa \label{E:Baction}
    e_6^{-1} {\cal L}_B &=& -\, \frac{1}{2 } \, R - \frac{1}{2 } \,
    \partial_{M} \varphi \, \partial^M\varphi  - \frac12 \, G_{ab}(\Phi) \,
    D_M \Phi^a \, D^M \Phi^b \cr
    && \qquad - \, \frac{1}{12}\, e^{-2\varphi} \;
    G_{MNP}G^{MNP} - \, \frac{1}{4} \, e^{-\varphi}
    \; F^\alpha_{MN}F_\alpha^{MN}
    -  e^\varphi \, v(\Phi) \, ,
\eeqa
%
where we choose units for which the 6D Planck mass is unity:
$\kappa_6^2 = 8 \pi G_6 = 1$. Here the index $\alpha = 1, \dots,
\hbox{dim}(G)$ runs over the gauge-group generators,
$G_{ab}(\Phi)$ is the metric on ${\cal M}$ and $D_m$ are gauge and
K\""ahler covariant derivatives whose details are not important for
our purposes. The dependence on $\varphi$ of the scalar potential,
$V = e^{\varphi} \, v(\Phi)$, is made explicit, and when $\Phi^a =
0$ the factor $v(\Phi)$ satisfies $v(0) = 2 \, g_1^2$. As above
$g_1$ here denotes the $U(1)$ gauge coupling. As usual $e_6 = |\det
{e_M}^A| = \sqrt{-\det g_{MN}}$. The bosonic part of the basic
Salam-Sezgin model is obtained from the above by setting all gauge
fields to zero except for the explicit $U(1)$ group factor, and by
setting $\Phi^a = 0$.

\subsection{Compactification on a Sphere}
%
We next briefly describe the compactification of this model to
four dimensions on an internal two-sphere with magnetic monopole
background, along the lines of the Randjbar-Daemi, Salam and Strathdee
model \cite{RSS} and its supersymmetric extensions, 
ref.~\cite{SS,RSSS}. The equations of motion for the bosonic fields
which follow from the action, eq.~\pref{E:Baction}, are:
%
\eqa \label{E:Beom}
    &&\Box \, \varphi + \frac16 \, e^{-2 \varphi}
    \, G_{MNP} \, G^{MNP} + \frac14 \, e^{-\varphi} \; F^\alpha_{MN}
    F^{MN}_\alpha - e^\varphi \, v(\Phi) = 0 \nn\\
    &&D_M \Bigl( e^{-2\varphi} \, G^{MNP} \Bigr) = 0  \\
    &&D_M \Bigl( e^{-\varphi} \, F^{MN}_\alpha \Bigr) + e^{-2\varphi} \,
    G^{MNP} \, F_{\alpha MP} = 0 \nn \\
    && D_M D^M \Phi^a - G^{ab}(\Phi) \, v_{b}(\Phi) \, e^\varphi = 0 \nn\\
    &&R_{MN} + \partial_M\varphi \, \partial_N \varphi +
    G_{ab}(\Phi) \, D_M \Phi^a \, D_N \Phi^b + \frac12 \,
    e^{-2\varphi} \, G_{MPQ} \, {G_N}^{PQ} \nn\\
    && \qquad \qquad \qquad + \, e^{-\varphi} \, F_{MP}^\alpha
    {F_{\alpha N}}^P + \frac12 \,  (\Box \varphi )\, g_{MN} = 0 , \nn
\eeqa
%
where $v_b = \partial v/\partial \Phi^b$.

We are interested in a compactified solution to these equations
which distinguishes four of the dimensions -- $x^\mu, \mu =
0,1,2,3$ -- from the other two -- $y^m, m=4,5$. A convenient
compactification proceeds by choosing $\varphi =$ constant,
%
\eq \label{E:FRansatz}
    {g}_{MN} = \pmatrix{
    {g}_{\mu\nu}(x) & 0 \cr 0 & {g}_{mn}(y) \cr}
    \qquad \hbox{and} \qquad
    T_\alpha \, {F}^\alpha_{MN} = Q \, \pmatrix{0 & 0 \cr 0 &
    F_{mn}(y) \cr}  ,
\eeq
%
where ${g}_{\mu\nu}$ is a maximally-symmetric Lorentzian metric
({\it i.e.} de Sitter, anti-de Sitter or flat space) and
${g}_{mn}$ is the standard metric on the two-sphere, $S_2$:
$g_{mn} \, \exd y^m \exd y^n = r^2 \, (\exd\theta^2 + \sin^2
\theta \, \exd\phi^2 )$
. The only nonzero Maxwell field
corresponds to a $U(1)$, whose generator $Q$ we take to lie
anywhere amongst the generators $T_\alpha$ of the gauge group.
Maximal symmetry on the 2-sphere requires we choose the Maxwell
field to be $F_{mn} = f \, {\epsilon}_{mn}(y)$ where
$\epsilon_{mn}$ is the sphere's volume form.\footnote{In our
conventions $\epsilon_{\theta\phi} = e_2 = \sqrt{\, \det
g_{mn}}$.} All other fields vanish.

As is easily verified, the above ansatz solves the field equations
provided that $r$, $f$ and $\varphi$ are constants  and the
following three conditions are satisfied: ${R}_{\mu\nu} = 0$,
${F}_{mn} {F}^{mn} = 8\, g_1^2 e^{2{\varphi}}$ and ${R}_{mn} = -
\, e^{-{\varphi}} \, {F}_{mp} \, {{F}_n}^p = - f^2 e^{-{\varphi}}
\, {g}_{mn}$.\footnote{Notice that the symmetries of the 
2D sphere actually imply that $\varphi$ should be constant, and select
flat Minkowski space over dS or AdS as the only maximally symmetric
solution of the field equations, given this ansatz.}  These imply the following conditions:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Four dimensional spacetime is flat;
%
\item
The magnetic flux of the electromagnetic field through the sphere
is given -- with an appropriate normalization for $Q$ -- by $f =
{n /( 2 \, g_1 \, {r}^2)}$, where ${r}$ is the radius of the
sphere, $g_1$ is the $U(1)$ gauge coupling which appears in the
scalar potential when we use $v(0) = 2 \, g_1^2$, and the monopole
number is $n = \pm 1$;
%
\item
The sphere's radius is related to ${\varphi}$ by $ e^{\varphi} \,
{r}^2 = {1 /( 4 g_1^2)}$. Otherwise $\varphi$ and $r$ are
unconstrained.
%
\end{enumerate}

What is noteworthy here is that the four dimensions are flat even
though the internal two dimensions are curved. In detail this
arises because of a cancellation between the contributions of the
two-dimensional curvature, $R_2$, the dilaton potential and the
Maxwell action. This cancellation is not fine-tuned, since it
follows as an automatic consequence of the field equations given
only the choice of a discrete variable: the  magnetic flux
quantum, $n = \pm 1$. It is important to notice that the
requirement $n = \pm 1$ is required both in Einstein's equation to
obtain flat 4D space, and in the dilaton equation to obtain a
constant dilaton. By contrast, in a non-supersymmetric theory like
the pure Einstein-Maxwell system the absence of the dilaton
equation allows one to always have flat 4D spacetime for any
monopole number by appropriately tuning the 6D cosmological
constant.

It is instructive to ask what happens in supergravity if another
choice for $n$ were made. In this case the cancellation in the
first of eqs.~\pref{E:Beom} no longer goes through, with the
implication that $\Box \, \varphi \ne 0$. It follows that with
this choice $\varphi$ cannot remain constant and so the theory
spontaneously breaks the $SO(3)$ invariance of the two-sphere in
addition to curving the noncompact four dimensions.

The above compactification reduces to that of the basic
Salam-Sezgin model if $Q$ is taken to be the generator of the
explicit $U(1)$ gauge factor. In this case the compactification
also preserves $N=1$ supersymmetry in four dimensions \cite{SS}.
Consequently in this case the flatness of the noncompact four
dimensions for the choice $n= \pm 1$ is stable against
perturbative quantum corrections, because it is protected by the
perturbative non-renormalization theorems of the unbroken
four-dimensional $N=1$ supersymmetry. (See ref.~\cite{susysphere}
for a more detailed discussion of the resulting 4D supergravity
which results.) 

\subsection{Including Branes: Field Equations}
%
We next describe the couplings of this supergravity to branes
that we use in later sections. We take the coupling of a 3-brane
to the bulk fields discussed above to be given by the brane action
%
\eq \label{BraneAction}
    S_b = - T \int d^4 x \; e^{\lambda \varphi} \left( - \det
    \gamma_{\mu\nu} \right)^{1/2} \, ,
\eeq
%
where $\gamma_{\mu\nu} = g_{MN} \, \partial_\mu x^M \,
\partial_\nu x^N$ is the induced metric on the brane. For simplicity we do
not consider any direct couplings to the bulk Maxwell field, such
as is possible
%
\eq
    {S_{b}}' = - \, q \int \; {}^*F \, ,
\eeq
%
where $q$ is a coupling constant and ${}^*F$ denotes the (pull
back of the) Hodge dual (4-form) of the Maxwell field strength. We
also do not write a brane coupling to $A_M$ of Dirac-Born-Infeld
form, although this last coupling could be included without
substantially changing our later conclusions.

The constant $\lambda$ controls the brane-dilaton coupling and
depends on the kind of brane under consideration. For instance
consider a D$p$-brane, for which the coupling to the
ten-dimensional dilaton is known to have the following form in the
string frame:
%
\eq
    S_{\rm SF} = - T \int d^nx \;  e^{-\varphi} \left( - \det
    \hat{\gamma}_{\mu\nu} \right)^{1/2} \, ,
\eeq
%
where $n = p+1$ is the dimension of the brane world-sheet. This
leads in the Einstein frame, $\hat{\gamma}_{\mu\nu} =
e^{\varphi/2} \, \gamma_{\mu\nu}$, to the result $\lambda ="
