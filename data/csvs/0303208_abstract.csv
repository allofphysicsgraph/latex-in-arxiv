{} We address dynamical supersymmetry breaking
  within a $N=1$ supersymmetric Standard-like Model based on a
   $Z_2\times Z_2$  Type IIA
 orientifold with intersecting D6-branes.
  The model possesses an additional, confining gauge sector  with the $USp(2)_A\times USp(2)_B
 \times USp(4)$ gauge group, where the  gaugino condensation mechanism  allows for the breaking of
  supersymmetry and stabilizes  moduli.
   We  derive  the  leading  contribution to the non-perturbative
  effective superpotential and determine numerically  the minima of the
    supergravity potential.
   These minima break supersymmetry  and  fix two undetermined moduli, which in turn
  completely specify the gauge couplings at the string scale. For this specific
   construction the minima have a negative cosmological constant.
  We expect that for  other supersymmetric Standard-like models with intersecting D6-branes,
   which also possess confining gauge sectors, the   supersymmetry
 breaking mechanism would have  qualitatively similar features.
