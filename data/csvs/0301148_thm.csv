0,"\begin{thm} Let $u\in T_{x(0)}H$ generate a geodesic through $x(0)$ which
remains in $H$. Then $u$ lies in a codimension 1 cone in $T_{x(0)}H$.
For generic $x(0)\in H$, the link of this cone
is the suspension of a two-torus. There is at most a nowhere dense subset
of $H$ on which the link of the cone is $S^3\cup S^3$, two three-spheres
intersecting in an equatorial two-sphere.

\label{taucty}
Let $\phi_n:M \rightarrow N$ be a sequence of smooth holomorphic maps between
compact
K\""ahler manifolds converging in $C^1$ to the
smooth holomorphic map $\phi:M \rightarrow N$. Suppose all the Jacobi fields of
$\phi$ are integrable and that the conclusions of Lemma \ref{hesscty}
