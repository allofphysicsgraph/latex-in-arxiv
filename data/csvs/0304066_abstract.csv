{We perform the matching required to compute the leading effective
boundary contribution to the QED lagrangian in the presence of a
conducting surface, once the electron is integrated out. Our
result resolves a confusion in the literature concerning the
interpretation of the leading such correction to the Casimir
energy. It also provides a useful theoretical laboratory for
brane-world calculations in which kinetic terms are generated on
the brane, since a lot is known about QED near boundaries.}
