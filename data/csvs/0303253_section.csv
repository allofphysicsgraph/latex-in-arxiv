Greek indices $\mu,\nu,\rho,\ldots$ denote curved spacetime indices while 
Latin $a,b,c\ldots$ indices are tangent spacetime indices. They are related by the
vielbeins $e_{\mu}{}^{a}$ and inverse vielbeins $e_{a}{}^{\mu}$. Explicit
indices $0, \ldots, 9$ are underlined for tangent spacetime coordinates and not underlined
for the curved coordinates. We use hats for 10-dimensional objects (both IIA and IIB) 
and no hats for 9-dimensional objects. We use mostly plus signature $(-+\cdots+)$ and
our metric is always given in Einstein frame.
$i,j,\ldots$ are worldvolume indices while $r,s,\ldots$ are $SL(2,\RR)$-indices. 
Indices of the latter type can be raised and lowered with $\epsilon^{rs}$ and $\epsilon_{rs}$, with $\epsilon^{12}=+1$ and $\epsilon_{12}=-1$.

For type IIB, the reduction is
\begin{align}\nn
\hat{e}_{\hat{\mu}}{}^{\hat{a}}&=\left(\begin{array}{cc}e^{\sqrt{7}\varphi/28}e_\mu{}^a&-e^{-\sqrt{7}\varphi/4}A_\mu\\0&e^{-\sqrt{7}\varphi/4}\end{array}\right)\, ,\\
(\hat{B}_r)_{\mu\nu}&=(\Omega^{-1T})_r{}^s(B_s)_{\mu\nu}\, ,\\\nn
(\hat{B}_r)_{\mu x}&=-(\Omega^{-1T})_r{}^s(A_s)_\mu\, ,\\\nn
\hat{{\cal M}}^{rs}&=\Omega^r{}_p \, \Omega^s{}_q \,{\cal M}^{pq}\, .
\end{align}
For type IIA, the reduction is
\begin{align}\nn
\hat{e}_{\hat{\mu}}{}^{\hat{a}}&=\left(\begin{array}{cc}e^{\phi/16-3\varphi/16\sqrt{7}}e_\mu{}^a&e^{-7\phi/16+3\sqrt{7}\varphi/16}(A_1)_\mu\\0&e^{-7\phi/16+3\sqrt{7}\varphi/16}\end{array}\right)\, ,\\\nn
\hat{B}_{\mu\nu}&=-(B_1)_{\mu\nu}+2(A_1)_{[\mu}A_{\nu]}\, ,\\
\hat{B}_{\mu x}&=-A_\mu\, ,\\\nn
\hat{A}_\mu&=-(A_2)_\mu+\chi(A_1)_\mu\, ,\\\nn
\hat{A}_x&=-\chi\, ,\\\nn
\hat{\phi}&=\frac{3\phi}{4}+\frac{\sqrt{7}\varphi}{4}\, .
\end{align}

The supersymmetry variations of the fermions in 9D gauged supergravity are given by
