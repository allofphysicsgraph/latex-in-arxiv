Basing on the standard construction of critical string amplitudes we
analyze properties of the longitudinal sector of the non-critical
Nambu--Goto string. We demonstrate that it cannot be described by
standard (in the sense of BPZ) conformal field theory. As an alternative
we propose a new version of the geometric approach to
Liouville theory and formulate its basic consistency condition --- the
geometric bootstrap equation.
