\caption{\label{fig_triangle}%
The holonomy $\alignidx{g_{12}g_{23}g_{13}^{-1}}$ around some triangle
$(1,2,3)$. The inner triangle is labeled by a functor
$F\colon\sym{C}^{V,E}\to\sym{G}^G$, the outer triangle by $\tilde
F$. The functors $F$ and $\tilde F$ are related by a natural
equivalence $\eta$.  }

  (a) Horizontal composition of faces is denoted by a dot
  ($\cdot$). (b)~Vertical composition is indicated by a little circle
  ($\circ$) which is read from left to right in our equations. (c)
  Parentheses are not necessary provided the exchange
  law~\eqref{eq_exchange} holds.}

A tetrahedron with vertices labeled $1,2,3,4$. Each triangle

\caption{\label{fig_commutative}%
The inner tetrahedron is labeled by a strict $2$-functor
$F\colon\sym{C}^{V,E,F}\to \sym{G}^{G,H}$, the outer one by some
strict $2$-functor $\tilde F$ (notation as in~\eqref{eq_labeled}). Both
$2$-functors are related by a pseudo-natural transformation
$\eta\colon F\Rightarrow\tilde F$. For simplicity, we have not drawn the
double arrows on the faces.}
