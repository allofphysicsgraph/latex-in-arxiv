 Weak-strong coupling duality relations are shown to be present in the 
quantum-mechanical many-body system with the interacting potential 
proportional to the pair-wise inverse-squared distance in addition to the
 harmonic potential. Using duality relations we have solved the problem of
 families interacting by the inverse-squared interaction. Owing to duality,
  the coupling constants of the families are mutually inverse. The spectrum
 and eigenfunctions are determined mainly algebraically owing to $O(2,1)$
 dynamical symmetry. The constructed Hamiltonian for families and appropriate
 solutions are of hierarchical nature.\\
