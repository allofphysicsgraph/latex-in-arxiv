We present a method for
evaluating divergent
Borel-nonsummable
 series
by
 an analytic continuation
 of variational perturbation
 theory. We demonstrate its validity
by an application to the exactly known partition function
of the anharmonic oscillator
in zero spacetime dimensions,
and derive
the full imaginary part of the
 ground state energy of
 the anharmonic oscillator for all negative
 values of
 the coupling constant $g$.
As a
highlight
 of the theory
we retrieve
from the divergent
perturbation expansion
the instanton action and the contribution
of the higher  loop
fluctuations
around the
instanton
in
the path integral.
