We study the realization of anomalous Ward identities in
deconstructed (latticized) supersymmetric theories. In a
deconstructed four-dimensional theory with $N=2$ supersymmetry, we
show that the chiral symmetries only appear  in the infrared  and
that the anomaly is reproduced in the usual framework of  lattice
perturbation theory with Wilson fermions. We then realize the
theory on the world-volume of fractional D-branes on an orbifold.
In this brane realization, we show how deconstructed theory
anomalies can be computed via classical supergravity. Our methods
and observations are more generally applicable to
deconstructed/latticized supersymmetric theories in various
dimensions.
