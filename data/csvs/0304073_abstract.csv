We show that some higher derivative theories have a BRST
symmetry. This symmetry is due to the higher derivative structure and
is not associated to any gauge invariance. If physical states are
defined as those in the BRST cohomology then the only physical state
is the vacuum. All negative norm states, characteristic of higher
derivative theories, are removed from the physical sector. As a
consequence, unitarity is recovered but the S-matrix is trivial. We 
show that a class of higher derivative quantum gravity theories have
this BRST symmetry so that they are consistent as quantum field
theories. Furthermore, this BRST symmetry may be present in both
relativistic and non-relativistic systems.
