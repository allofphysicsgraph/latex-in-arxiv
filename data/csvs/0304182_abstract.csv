 We  offer a physicists' proof that center-vortex theory requires the area in the Wilson-loop area law to involve an extremal area. This means that unlike in string-theory-inspired models of confining flux tubes,   area-law dynamics is determined  by integrating over Wilson loops only, not over surface fluctuations for a fixed loop. Fluctuations leading to to perimeter-law corrections  come from loop fluctuations as well as integration over finite-thickness center-vortex collective coordinates. In  $d=3$ (or $d=2+1$) we exploit a contour form of the extremal area in isothermal which is  similar to $d=2$ (or $d=1+1$) QCD in many respects, except that there are both quartic and quadratic terms in the action.    One major result is that at large angular momentum $\ell$ in $d=3+1$ the center-vortex extremal-area picture yields a linear Regge trajectory with Regge slope--string tension product $\alpha'(0)K_F$ of  $1/(2\pi )$, which is the canonical Veneziano/string value.  In a curious effect traceable to retardation, the quark kinetic terms in the action vanish relative to area-law terms in the large-$\ell$ limit, in which light-quark masses $\sim K_F^{1/2}$ are negligible. This corresponds to string-theoretic expectations, even though we emphasize that the extremal-area law is not a string theory quantum-mechanically.  We show how some quantum trajectory fluctuations as well as non-leading classical terms for finite mass yield corrections scaling with $\ell^{-1/2}$.   We compare to  old semiclassical calculations of relativistic (massless) $q\bar{q}$ bound states at large $\ell$, which also yield asymptotically-linear Regge trajectories, finding agreement with a naive string picture (classically, not quantum-mechanically) and disagreement with an effective-propagator model.   We show that contour forms of the area law can be expressed in terms of Abelian gauge potentials, and relate this to old work of Comtet.
