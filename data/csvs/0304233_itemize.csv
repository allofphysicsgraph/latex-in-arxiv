\item In the first step, we determine the ``electric"" submatrix of
the Cartan matrix obtained by restricting (\ref{Cartan}) to the
dominant electric wall forms (\ref{dominantelectric}). This
clearly yields the Cartan matrix of the maximal split subalgebra
${\cal F}$ since the $\s_\a$ are the simple roots. \item We next
add the dominant magnetic wall form (\ref{dominantmagnetic}).
\begin{itemize} \item If the restricted root system is not of $bc$-type, the
highest root $\theta(\phi)$ is also the highest root of the root
system of ${\cal F}$. Since the linear form $\b^1$ has length
squared equal to zero and is orthogonal to any linear form
involving only the dilatons, we see that the dominant magnetic
wall form (\ref{dominantmagnetic}) has length squared equal to two
and is such that $(\b^1 - \theta \vert \s_\a) = - (\theta \vert
\s_\a)$. This enables one to identify the dominant magnetic wall
form with the affine root of the untwisted affine extension ${\cal
F}^{\wedge}$ of ${\cal F}$ \cite{Kac,MP}. At this stage, we thus
have ${\cal F}^{\wedge}$. \item If the restricted root system is
of $bc$-type, say $bc_r$, the first step yields the Cartan matrix
of $b_r$. We order the simple roots of $\bar B$ so that $\s_1$ is
the short root and $\s_i$ is linked to $\s_{i-1}$ and $\s_{i+1}$
($1<i<r$). The highest root $\theta$ of the $bc_r$-system is
connected only to $\s_r$ and its length squared is four times that
of a short root (\cite{Helgason}, chapter X). This yields the
Cartan matrix of the twisted affine algebra $A_{2r}^{(2)}$ (which
one might in fact denote, with adapted conventions,
$BC_r^{\wedge}$, as in \cite{MP}). Note that since the highest
root has squared length equal to $2$, the short root $\s_1$ has
squared length $1/2$, the other simple roots having squared length
equal to $1$.
\end{itemize}
\item What remains to be done is to add the symmetry wall. The
only non-vanishing scalar products involving $w_S$ are $(w_S \vert
w_S) = 2$ and $(w_S \vert \b^1 - \theta) = -1$. Thus $w_S$ is
attached by a single line to the dominant magnetic root $\b^1 -
\theta$. This yields in all cases the Lorentzian extension of the
affine algebra obtained in the previous step, the overextended
root being $w_S$. Thus we do indeed get ${\cal F}^{\wedge \wedge}$
if the restricted root system is not of $bc$-type, and
$A_{2k}^{(2)\wedge}$ otherwise. $\Box$
