It has been shown recently \cite{FS} that Cauchy transforms of
orthogonal polynomials appear naturally in general correlation
functions containing ratios of characteristic polynomials of
random $N\times N$ Hermitian matrices.
Our main goal is to investigate
the issue of universality of large N asymptotics for those
Cauchy transforms for a wide class of weight functions.
Our analysis covers three different scaling regimes:
the ""hard edge"", the ""bulk""
and the ""soft edge"" of the spectrum, thus extending the earlier
results known for the bulk. The principal tool
is to show that for finite matrix size $N$
the auxiliary ""wave functions"" associated with the Cauchy transforms
obey the same second order differential equation
as those associated with the orthogonal polynomials themselves.
