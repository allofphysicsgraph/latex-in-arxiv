\section{Electromagnetism in the Pure Tachyon Background}

In this appendix we will discuss in detail 
the fluctuations around rolling tachyon
background (\ref{ts}) without electric or magnetic field, ${\bf E}_{0}=
{\bf B}_{0}=0$.

The fluctuation $\delta T(t,{\bf X})$ of tachyon satisfies the
linearized equation
\begin{equation}\label{dte}
\partial_0\left( \frac{\delta \dot T}{1-\dot T^2} \right) 
        - \nabla^2 \delta T 
+\frac{d^2\ln V}{dT^2} \delta T = 0,
\end{equation}
and it decouples from the electromagnetic 
fluctuations. Near the top of the potential it reduces to the Klein-Gordon 
equation with negative mass and diverges exponentially as it should.
At late time, $\dot T \rightarrow 1$, the first term dominates and the
fluctuation stops propagating~\cite{Sen}. 
As we will see shortly, the fluctuation of
the gauge field also shows the same behavior. Actually this is a consequence
of Carrollian limit of vanishing light speed at late time of
rolling tachyon without background electromagnetic field~\cite{IU,MS,GHY}.

Now we consider the propagation of the gauge field $A_{\mu}$ in the 
rolling tachyon background (\ref{ts}) by linearizing the
equation of motion (\ref{ge}) in this background. Written in terms
of electric and magnetic fields, it becomes a modified Amp\'{e}re's law
\begin{equation}\label{ameq}
\nabla\times {\bf B}=\frac{\epsilon_{0}^{2}}{V(t)^{2}}
\frac{\partial {\bf E}}{\partial t},
\end{equation}
where we have used the fact that
$V(T)/\sqrt{1-\dot{T}^{2}}\equiv\epsilon_{0}$ is a constant.
Then one may identify the tachyon potential $V(t)/\epsilon_0$ 
as the varying speed of electromagnetic waves. In particular, the late time 
behavior $V(t)\rightarrow 0$ corresponds to the Carrollian limit. 
This seems to suggest a dictionary `velocity of electromagnetic waves 
and tachyon potential' like `time and tachyon' in Ref.~\cite{Sen2}.
However, it should be confirmed by careful analysis.

Combined with the Faraday's law (\ref{faraday}), the wave equations of the 
electric field ${\bf E}$ and the magnetic field ${\bf B}$ can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\epsilon_{0}^2}{V^2}\frac{\partial^2{\bf B}}{\partial t^2}
-\nabla^2{\bf B} &=& 0,\label{beq1}\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left(\frac{\epsilon_{0}^2}{V^2}
\frac{\partial {\bf E}}{\partial t} \right)
-\nabla^2{\bf E} &=& 0. \label{eeq2r}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that these equations are not symmetrical since the Amp\'{e}re's law
(\ref{ameq}) is modified but Faraday's law (\ref{faraday}) is left unchanged.
More specifically, Eq.~(\ref{eeq2r}) has a kind of damping term which is 
the first order in time derivative and the propagation of electric field 
shows rather different behavior from that of magnetic field as demonstrated 
below.

To investigate in detail the propagation of electromagnetic wave in the
rolling tachyon background, let us try to find a plane-wave solution of 
Eqs.~(\ref{beq1}) and (\ref{eeq2r}).
Without loss of generality we consider the plane-wave propagating along 
the $x$-axis,
${\bf k}=k\hat{\bf x}$, and make an ansatz ${\bf B}=B_z(t,x)\hat{\bf z}$ with
\begin{equation} \label{Ba}
B_z(t,x) = B(t)e^{ik[x-W_B(t)]},
\end{equation}
where $B(t)$ and $W_B(t)$ are real.
We assume that $V(0)\approx1$ and $\dot W_B(0)\approx1$ so that
the ansatz (\ref{Ba}) gives the normal plane-wave initially.
Since $\bf E$ and $\bf B$ are related through the Amp\'ere's law 
(\ref{ameq}) and Faraday's law (\ref{faraday}),
${\bf E} = E_y(t,x) \hat{\bf y}$ is then given by
\begin{equation}
E_y(t,x) = E(t)e^{ik[x-W_E(t)]},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
E &=& \sqrt{\dot W_B^2B^2+k^{-2}\dot B^2}, \label{e-b1}\\
W_E &=&  W_B - k^{-1}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\dot B}{k \dot W_BB}\right).
\label{e-b2}
\end{eqnarray}
With this ansatz, Eq.~(\ref{beq1}) reduces to
\begin{eqnarray}
\ddot B-k^2\left(\dot W_B^2-\epsilon_{0}^{-2}V^2\right)B &=& 0, 
\label{fir}\\
2\dot B\dot W_B + B\ddot W_B &=& 0. \label{sec}
\end{eqnarray}
Eq.~(\ref{sec}) implies 
\begin{equation}
\dot W_B = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}}\left(\frac{B_0}{B}\right)^2, \label{Bspeed}
\end{equation}
where $B_0$ is a constant. From Eq.~(\ref{e-b2}) we also find
\begin{equation} \label{Espeed}
\dot W_E = \frac{V^2}{\epsilon_{0}^3}\left(\frac{B_0}{E}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
Inserting Eq.~(\ref{Bspeed}) into Eq.~(\ref{fir}), we obtain a
second-order nonlinear equation for amplitude of the magnetic field
\begin{equation}
\ddot B - \frac{k^2}{\epsilon_{0}^2}\left[
   \left(\frac{B_0}{B}\right)^4 - V^2 \right] B = 0. 
\label{Beq}
\end{equation}
On the top of the potential $V=1$, we get a normal plane-wave solution
$\dot W_B=\dot W_E=1/\epsilon_{0}$ with amplitudes of $B = B_0$ and 
$E=B_0/\epsilon_{0}$ as expected from the original wave equations 
(\ref{beq1})--(\ref{eeq2r}). 

To find more detailed behavior of the solution, we need to know the 
explicit form of $V(T(t))$. With the tachyon potential (\ref{V3}) and
the tachyon background (\ref{ts}), it becomes
\begin{equation}\label{vtt}
V(T(t)) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(a_+e^{t/T_0}-a_-e^{-t/T_0}\right)^2}}.
\end{equation}
In this case we solved Eq.~(\ref{Beq}) numerically and the result is shown
in  Fig.~\ref{fig1}. Note that the electric field goes to a constant value,
while the magnetic field linearly diverges. Also both $\dot W_E$ and 
$\dot W_B$ vanish after some time, which means that electromagnetic wave
freezes and does not propagate after the tachyon rolling.
In addition, one can see from the last figure of Fig.~\ref{fig1}
that waves with short 
wavelengths are frozen earlier than those with long wavelengths.
Finally $\dot W_E$ tends to
vanish faster than $\dot W_B$, i.e., the electric field is frozen more
quickly than the magnetic field. This is because $\dot W_E$ in (\ref{Espeed})
contains extra $V^2$ compared with $\dot W_B$ in Eq.~(\ref{Bspeed}).
\begin{figure}
\centerline{\epsfig{figure=emtfig1.eps}}

and $kT_0=10$ (dotted line).
}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

For the onset behavior, one can also obtain analytical expressions.
Once the tachyon rolls from the top of the potential, the fluctuations of
the gauge fields start deviating from the normal plane-wave solution.
With the initial condition $V(t=0)=1$, that is $T_i=0$, $V(T(t))$ reduces to
\begin{equation}
V(T(t)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\dot T_i\sinh^2(t/T_0)}}.
\end{equation}
Assuming that $\dot T_i$ is small,
which means the tachyon rolls slowly initially,
we can solve Eqs.~(\ref{Beq}) and (\ref{Bspeed})
to the first-order in $\dot T_i^2$:
\begin{eqnarray}
B(t) &=& B_0 \left[1 + \frac{\dot T_i^2\,k^2 T_0^2}{4(1+k^2 T_0^2)}
    \sinh^2\left(\frac{t}{T_0}\right)\right], \nonumber \\
W_B(t) &=& t - \frac{\dot T_i^2}{4}\left[
    t+\frac{k^2 T_0^3}{2(1+k^2T_0^2)}\sinh\left(\frac{2t}{T_0}\right)\right], 
\end{eqnarray}
where we have rescaled $B_0$ so that $B(0)=B_0$.
This solution is valid as long as $\dot T_i^2e^{t/T_0}\ll1$.
Thus the amplitude initially grows quadratically as the tachyon starts rolling.
On the other hand, electric field can be calculated
from Eqs.~(\ref{e-b1}) and (\ref{Espeed}),
\begin{eqnarray}
E(t) &=& B_0 \left[1 - \frac{\dot T_i^2}{4(1+k^2T_0^2)}
    \left(1+2k^2T_0^2+k^2T_0^2\sinh^2\left(\frac{t}{T_0}\right)\right)
    \right], \nonumber \\
W_E(t) &=& t - \frac{\dot T_i^2}{8(1+k^2T_0^2)}\left[
    (4+6k^2T_0^2)t + (2+k^2T_0^2)\sinh\left(\frac{2t}{T_0}\right) \right]. 
\end{eqnarray}
Note that $E(t)$ decreases in contrast with the behavior of magnetic field
and $\dot W_E$ decreases faster than $\dot W_B$.
This can be confirmed in Fig.~\ref{fig1}.

At late time, the value of the 
potential (\ref{vtt}) decays exponentially to zero
\begin{equation}
V(T(t)) \approx \frac{1}{a_+e^{t/T_0}},
\end{equation}
so that Eq.~(\ref{Beq}) becomes, up to ${\cal O}(e^{-2t/T_0})$,
\begin{equation}\label{Beql}
\ddot{B} - \frac{k^2 B_0^4}{\epsilon_0^2} \frac{1}{B^3} = 0,
\end{equation}
The solution of this equation is given by
\begin{equation}
B(t) = \left[\left(\frac{k^2 B_0^4}{\epsilon_0^2 b_0^2}+\dot b_0^2\right)t^2
    +2b_0\dot b_0t+b_0^2 \right]^{1/2} + {\cal O}(e^{-t/T_0}),
\end{equation}
where $b_0$ and $\dot b_0$ are constants.
Therefore $B(t)$ increases linearly in time and 
then the propagation speed decreases
according to Eq.~(\ref{Bspeed}) (See also Fig.~\ref{fig1}).
Since $B$ linearly increases, our linear approximation of the equation
of motion is not valid as $t$ becomes large. However, one may still
extract some relevant physics as the tachyon rolls to the vacuum, 
$V\rightarrow0$. The electromagnetic waves become frozen and stop propagating.
For the electric field in this limit, we find that
it approaches a constant value given by Eq.~(\ref{e-b1}).
Of course, this is an expected behavior since one may interpret
the infinite time limit of the rolling tachyon 
as the Carrollian limit. That is, 
the effective covariant metric tensors
$\bar{\eta}_{\mu\nu}=\mbox{diag}(-1+\dot{T}^{2},1,1,1)$ (\ref{emn})
goes to $\mbox{diag}(0,1,1,1)$, and light cone defined from 
$\bar{\eta}_{\mu\nu}$
collapses down to a timelike half line~\cite{GHY}.
