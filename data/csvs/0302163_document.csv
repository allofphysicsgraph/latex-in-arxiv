\begin{abstract}
We consider non-supersymmetric large $N$ orientifold field theories.
 Specifically, we discuss a gauge theory with a Dirac
 fermion in the anti-symmetric tensor representation. We argue that, at large
$N$ and in a
large part of its bosonic sector, this theory is non-perturbatively equivalent
to ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM, so that exact results established in
the latter (parent) theory  also hold in the daughter orientifold theory.
 In particular, the non-supersymmetric theory has an exactly calculable
bifermion
 condensate, exactly degenerate parity doublets, and
 a vanishing cosmological constant (all this to leading order
in $1/N$).

\section{Introduction}

\noindent

 Gauge field theories at strong coupling are of great importance in
 particle physics. Exact results in gauge theories at strong coupling
have a special weight. In the last few
years supersymmetry (SUSY) proved to be a guiding principle
(see e.g. \cite{srev}) providing deep insights in gauge
dynamics. Recently it was suggested
that a large number of symmetry relations valid in supersymmetric
theories remain valid in the large $N$ limit in non-supersymmetric daughter
theories obtained from the parent one through orbifoldization
 \cite{Strassler:2001fs}. The most popular
(non-SUSY) orbifolds are {${\bf Z}_2\ $}, or ${\bf Z}_k\ $ in general
 \cite{Gorsky:2002wt,Tong:2002vp,Dijkgraaf:2002wr}.
In particular, in the last paper it was argued
that the
 superpotential
of SUSY gluodynamics \cite{Veneziano:1982ah},
\begin{equation}
W(S)= N (S \log S/\Lambda ^3 -S)\,,\qquad S= \lambda \lambda + ...\,,
 \label{VY}
\end{equation}
 can be in a sense extended to its ${\bf Z}_2\ $ orbifold.
This is equivalent to the statement that the daughter
theory has $N$ vacua
labeled by a bifermion condensate
\begin{equation}
 \langle \lambda \lambda \rangle_k = N \Lambda ^3 \exp\left( i {2\pi k\over N}
\right).
 \label{condensate}
\end{equation} 
While the planar equivalence is certainly true
in perturbation theory \cite{Bershadsky:1998mb,Bershadsky:1998cb}
its nonperturbative status is being debated;
a number of arguments pro and con
can be found in the literature
\cite{Gorsky:2002wt,Tong:2002vp,Dijkgraaf:2002wr}.

 The purpose of this work is to present a non-supersymmetric
daughter
(different from the ${\bf Z}_k\ $ orbifolds) for which the large $N$ equivalence
between the parent SUSY theory and the daughter non-supersymmetric one
 at  nonperturbative level rests on a more solid ground than in the case of
the ${\bf Z}_k\ $ orbifolds.
This ``orientifold field theory''
 was suggested in Refs. \cite{Armoni:1999gc,Angelantonj:1999qg}
in a somewhat different context. One of its advantages over
more popular ${\bf Z}_k\ $ orbifolds is the absence in it of the twisted sector.

The field content of the orientifold gauge field theory  differs from
the one of its
 parent theory, U($N$) SUSY gluodynamics, in that the gluinos are replaced by
massless Dirac fermions in the rank-two antisymmetric tensor representation of
 U($N$) (denoted by $\asymm + \basymm$). The total number of (say) left handed fermions is thus $N(N-1)$ in the
daughter theory and $N^2$ in the parent theory and agrees to leading order
in $1/N$.  Similarly,
one can discuss a theory with a Dirac fermion in the symmetric
representation ($\symm+ \bsymm$).
As we will see,
this theory lives on a brane configuration of type 0A
string theory \cite{Armoni:1999gc} which consists of NS5 branes,
D4 branes and an
orientifold plane --- hence the name ``orientifold field theory.''
The daughter theory in our case is a much closer cousin of ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM
than the ${\bf Z}_2\ $ orbifold. Indeed, the gauge groups
in the parent and daughter theories are the same, and no rescaling
of the gauge couplings is needed.


Assuming that both
theories are in the confining regime\,\footnote{In the Higgs regime
the
$1/N$ expansion becomes more subtle, see a discussion below.},
we will show that in the large $N$ limit many results and
symmetry relations that were
obtained for ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM hold also for the above orientifold field
theory. One specific quantity is the bifermion condensate
(\ref {condensate}). It labels distinct vacua.
The number of vacua turns out to be the same in the parent and daughter
theories, $N$.
 Another result is the vanishing of the vacuum energy density
in the daughter theory.

We would like to emphasize that the spectrum of the
orientifold field theory {\em does
not} coincide with that of ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM in the large $N$ limit.
In particular, there is no SUSY. While the composite color-singlet
 hadrons of
${\cal N}=1\ $ are fermi-bose degenerate,    the composite color-singlet
 hadrons of
the orientifold field theory are purely bosonic.



The organization of this paper is as follows: in Sect. 2 we
present our main result ---
the perturbative and nonperturbative
equivalence.
In Sect. 3 we briefly present the string
theory realization of the theory in its conjectured relation to
M-theory. In Sect. 4 we compare our analysis and results with
those referring to ${\bf Z}_k\ $ orbifold field theories
and summarize conclusions. 

\section{Orientifold field theory and ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM}

\noindent

In this section we will argue that in the $N\to\infty$
limit there is a sector in the orientifold theory
exactly identical to ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM and, therefore, exact
results on the IR behavior of this theory can be obtained.

The parent theory is ${\cal N}=1\ $ SUSY gluodynamics with the gauge
group U($N$). In the large $N$ limit the U(1) factor is irrelevant.
The daughter theory has the same gauge group,
and  the same gauge coupling\,\footnote{To be more precise,
the gauge groups are almost the same.
The U(1) factor completely decouples in the parent theory,
while it does not decouple in the daughter one.
Moreover, in the former theory the ${\bf Z}_k\ $ center of the
gauge group acts
trivially while in the latter one it is only ${\bf Z}_2\ $ that acts trivially.
These distinctions are unimportant in the large $N$ limit.
}. The gluino field
$\lambda^i_j$ is replaced by two Weyl spinors
$\lambda_{[ij]}$ and $\xi^{[ij]}$. We can combine the Weyl spinors
into one Dirac spinor, either $\Psi_{[ij]}$ or $\Psi^{[ij]}$.
Note that the number of fermionic degrees of freedom
is $N^2-N$, as in the parent theory in the large $N$ limit.

The hadronic (color-singlet) sectors of the theories
are different. In the parent theory composite fermions with mass
scaling as $N^0$ exist, and moreover, they are degenerate with their
bosonic  SUSY counterparts. In the daughter theory any interpolating
color-singlet
current with the fermion quantum numbers contains a number of constituents
growing  with $N$. Hence at $N=\infty$
the spectrum contains only bosons.

Classically the parent theory has just an $R$ symmetry corresponding to
chiral rotations of the gluino field. Instantons break this symmetry down to
${\bf Z}_{2N}\ $.
The daughter theory has, on top, a conserved anomaly free  current
\begin{equation}
\bar \lambda_{\dot\alpha } \lambda_{\alpha}
-\bar \xi_{\dot\alpha } \xi_{\alpha}\,.
\label{veccur}
\end{equation}
In terms of the Dirac spinor this is the vector current
$\bar\Psi\gamma_\mu\Psi$.
If the corresponding charge is denoted by $Q$,
in the color-singlet bosonic sector $Q=0$,
with necessity. Then the only global symmetry which remains
in both theories is ${\bf Z}_{2N}\ $ spontaneously broken
down to
${\bf Z}_2\ $ by the respective bifermion condensates. This explains the existence
of $N$ vacua in both cases. We will compare the bosonic sectors of the
parent and daughter theories. Note that in the daughter theory
the part of the bosonic sector probed by the operators
of the type (\ref{veccur}), which have no analogs in the
parent theory, is inaccessible.

Let us start from  perturbative consideration. The general argument for
{\em any} orbifold/orientifold field theory is given in
\cite{Bershadsky:1998mb,Bershadsky:1998cb}.
Let us see how it works in our orientifold field theory.
The Feynman rules of the planar theory are shown in Fig.\ref{fey1}.
The difference between the orientifold theory and ${\cal N}=1\ $ is that the
arrows on the fermionic lines point in the same direction, since
the fermion is in the antisymmetric representation, in contrast
to the supersymmetric theory where the gaugino is in the adjoint
representation and the arrows point in the opposite directions.
This difference between the two theories does not affect planar
graphs provided each
gaugino line is replaced by the sum
of $\lambda_{[..]}$ and $\lambda^{[..]}$.

SYM. (c) The non-SUSY theory.}
\label{fey1}
\end{figure}

 There is a one-to-one correspondence between the planar graphs
of the two theories. Diagrammatically this works as follows (see, for
example, Fig. \ref{fey2}). Consider any planar diagram of the daughter theory:
by definition of planarity it can be drawn on a sphere. The fermionic
 propagators form closed, non-intersecting loops that divide the sphere into
regions. Each time we cross a fermionic line the orientation of color-indices
 loops (each one producing a factor $N$)
changes from clock to anti-clock wise, and vice-versa, as easily seen in
Fig. 2c. Thus, the fermionic loops
allow to attribute to each one of the above regions a binary label (say $\pm1$)
 according to whether the color loops go
clock- or anti-clock-wise in that region. Now
imagine that  the orientation
of color loops in all  regions with the $-1$ label is {\em reversed}. 
We will get a planar diagram of the SYM theory in which
all color loops go, by convention, clock-wise.
The number associated with both diagrams will be the same since the diagrams
inside each region always contain
an even number of powers of $g$ so that the relative minus signs of
Fig. 1 do not matter.

 Let us illustrate how this works, say, for
the inside part of the graph in Fig. \ref{fey2}b. In the parent theory
we have the color factor Tr $(T^aT^bT^c)\, f^{abc}$ while in the daughter one
Tr $(\bar T^a \bar T^b \bar T^c)\, f^{abc}$ where $\bar T = -\tilde T$
and the tilde marks the transposed matrix\,\footnote{To make the following expressions
concise we use a shorthand,
$T^a=T^a _{\raisebox{-.5pt}{\hbox{%
\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}\hskip-0.4pt%  left vertical
\rule{6.5pt}{0.4pt}\hskip-6.5pt%  lower horizontal
\rule[6.5pt]{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\hskip-0.4pt%upper horizontal
\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}}} $ and $\bar T^a=T^a _{\overline{\raisebox{-.5pt}{\hbox{%
\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}\hskip-0.4pt%  left vertical
\rule{6.5pt}{0.4pt}\hskip-6.5pt%  lower horizontal
\rule[6.5pt]{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\hskip-0.4pt%upper horizontal
\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}}}} $.
}. Using the fact that
$$
[T^aT^b]=i f^{abc}T^c\quad\mbox{and}\quad [\bar T^a\bar T^b]=i f^{abc}\bar T^c
$$
we immediately come to the conclusion that the above two expressions
coincide.

\label{fey2}
\end{figure}

Thus, all perturbative results that we know of in ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM
apply for the orientifold model as well. For example, the
$\beta$ function of the orientifold field theory is
\begin{equation}
\beta = -\frac{1}{2\pi}\,\frac{3N\alpha^2}{1- (N\alpha)/(2\pi)}
\left\{1+ O\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)
\right\},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha = {g^2 \over 4\pi}$. In the large $N$ limit it coincides with the ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM result
\cite{nsvzbeta}. Note that the corrections are $1/N$ rather than
$1/N^2$. For instance, the exact first coefficient
of the $\beta$ function is $-3N-4/3$ versus
$-3N$ in the parent theory. 

Now let us argue that the perturbative argument can be elevated
to nonperturbative level in the case at hand. 
A heuristic argument in favor
 of the nonperturbative equivalence is that the coincidence
of all  planar graphs 
of the two theories implies that the relevant Casimir operators of the two
representations are equivalent in the large $N$ limit. The partition
functions of the two theories depend  on the   Casimir operators
 and therefore must  
coincide as well.   

A more formal line of reasoning is as follows.
It is essential that the fermion fields enter
bilinearly in the action, and that for any {\em given}
gauge field configuration in the parent theory there
is exactly the same configuration in the daughter one.
(The latter feature is absent in the ${\bf Z}_k\ $ orbifolds.)
Our idea is to integrate out fermion fields
for any fixed gluon field configuration,
which yields respective determinants, and then compare them.

Consider the partition function of ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM,
\begin{equation}
{\cal Z}_0 = \int {\cal D}A\, {\cal D}\lambda \, \exp \left(iS[A,\lambda, J]
\right)\,,
\end{equation}
where $J$ is any source coupled to color-singlet  gluon operators
(we will discuss color-singlet fermion bilinears later).

For any given gluon field, upon
 integrating out the gaugino field, we obtain
\begin{equation}
{\cal Z}_0 = \int {\cal D}A \, \exp\left( iS[A, J]
\right)  \det \left ("
