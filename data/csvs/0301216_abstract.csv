A Fermi ball is a kind of non-topological soliton, which is thought to
arise from the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $Z_2$ symmetry and
to contribute to cold dark matter. We consider a simple model in which
fermion fields with multi-flavors are coupled to a scalar field through
Yukawa coupling, and examine how the number of the fermion flavors
affects the stability of the Fermi ball against the fragmentation. (1)We
find that the Fermi ball is stable against the fragmentation in most
cases even in the lowest order thin-wall approximation. (2)We then find
that in the other specific cases, the stability is marginal in the
lowest order thin-wall approximation, and the next-to-leading order
correction determines the stable region of the coupling constants; We
examine the simplest case where the total fermion number $N_i$ and the
Yukawa coupling constant $G_i$ of each flavor $i$ are common to the
flavor, and find that the Fermi ball is stable in the limited region of
the parameters and has the broader region for the larger number of the
flavors.
