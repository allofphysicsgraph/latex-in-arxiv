The operators $A_{i}^\pm$, $i=1,\ldots,n$,
satisfying~(\ref{2.11}),
are odd elements generating the Lie superalgebra $sl(1|n)$~\cite{24}.

If the system is
in one of the $\T$-basis states  $|p;\T\ra$, then measurements of
the position of the oscillating particle  are such that it can
only be observed to occupy one of  the 8 nests with
coordinates
\beq
 r_{k\pm}=\pm \sqrt{p-q+\t_k},~~k=1,2,3,
\label{4.16}
\eeq
on a sphere of dimensionless radius $\rho_q=\sqrt{3p-2q} $.
The probability ${\cal P}(\pm \pm \pm)$ of finding  the
particle in the nest with coordinates
$(r_{1\pm},r_{2\pm},r_{3\pm})$ cannot be determined. However, the
 probability of finding the particle somewhere in the four nests
with first coordinate equal to $r_{1+}$ is 1/2, and of  finding
it somewhere in the four nests with first coordinate equal to
$r_{1-}$ is also 1/2. The same holds for the second and third
coordinates.

The measurement of the momentum of the particle can take one of
the eight values
\beq
 p_{k\pm}=\pm \sqrt{p-q+\t_k},~~k=1,2,3.
\label{4.17}
\eeq
Again, the individual probabilities for each of the eight
possible values of the momenta cannot be determined; but the
the probability of having  a fixed component $p_{k+}$ is 1/2, and
that of a fixed component $p_{k-}$ is also 1/2 ($k=1,2,3$).

To each $p=1$ mean trajectory in the
phase space of the Wigner quantum oscillator there corresponds an
identical trajectory of the 3D Bose canonical quantum oscillator.
