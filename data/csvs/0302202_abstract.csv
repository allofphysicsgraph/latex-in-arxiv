The bosonization and duality rules in three-dimensions are applied to
analyze some features of superfluids and superconductors. The energy of an
ensemble of vortices in a superfluid is recovered by means of a kind of
bound which, to some extent, shares similarity with the Bogomol'nyi bound.
In the case of superconductors, after recasting the partition function in
the form of a pure effective gauge theory, the existence of finite energy
vortex solutions is discussed.
