We present evidence that dimensional reduction in Minkowksi space is  
induced by quantum entanglement. 
First, we show that correlation functions of a class of
operators restricted to a sub-volume of D-dimensional Minkowski 
space scale as its surface area. 
A simple example of such area scaling is provided by the
energy fluctuations of a free massless quantum field in its vacuum
state. This is reminiscent of area scaling of entropy of
entanglement but applies to quantum expectation values in a pure
state, rather than to statistical averages over a mixed state.
We then show, in specific cases,  that the 
bulk theory in the sub-volume has a holographic 
representation in terms of a boundary 
theory at high temperature.
