\item{(1)} Choose the discrete group $\Gamma$. Here we are considering
only $\Gamma = Z_p$. We define $\alpha = {\rm exp}(2 \pi i/p)$.

\item{(2)} Choose the embedding of $\Gamma \subset SU(4)$ by
assigning ${\bf 4} = (\alpha^{A_1}, \alpha^{A_2}, \alpha^{A_3}, \alpha^{A_4})$
such that $\sum_{q=1}^{q=4} A_q = 0 ({\rm mod} p)$. To
break $N = 4$ supersymmetry to
$N = 0$ ( or $N = 1$) requires that
none (or one) of the $A_q$ is equal to zero (mod p).

\item{(3)} For chiral fermions one requires that ${\bf 4} \not\equiv {\bf 4^{*}}$
for the embedding of $\Gamma$ in $SU(4)$.

The chiral fermions are in the bifundamental representations of $SU(N)^p$
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{i=p} \sum_{q=1}^{q=4}
(N_i, \bar{N}_{i + A_q})
\label{fermions}
\end{equation}
If $A_q=0$ we interpret $(N_i, \bar{N}_i)$ as a singlet plus an adjoint
of $SU(N)_i$.

\item{(4)} The {\bf 6} of $SU(4)$ is real {\bf 6} = $(a_1, a_2, a_3, -a_1, -a_2, -a_3)$
with
$a_1 = A_1 + A_2$,
$a_2 = A_2 + A_3$,
$a_3 = A_3 + A_1$
(recall that all components are defined modulo p).
The complex scalars are in the bifundamentals
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{i=p} \sum_{j=1}^{j=3}
(N_i, \bar{N}_{i \pm a_j})
\label{scalars}
\end{equation}
\noindent The condition in terms of $a_j$ for $N = 0$ is
$\sum_{j=1}^{j=3} (\pm a_j) \not= 0 ({\rm mod}~~ p)$\cite{Frampton}.
\item{(5)} Choose the $N$ of $\bigotimes_i SU(Nd_i)$ (where the $d_i$ are the
dimensions of the representrations of $\Gamma$). For the abelian case
where $d_i \equiv 1$, it is natural to choose $N=3$ the largest
$SU(N)$ of the standard model (SM) gauge group. For a non-abelian $\Gamma$
with $d_i \not\equiv 1$ the choice $N=2$ would be indicated.

\item{(6)}  The $p$ quiver nodes are identified as color (C), weak isospin (W)
or a third $SU(3)$ (H). This specifies the embedding of the gauge group
$SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_W \times SU(3)_H \subset \bigotimes SU(N)^p$.

This quiver node identification is guided by (7), (8) and (9) below.

\item{(7)}  The quiver node identification is required to
give three chiral families under Eq.(\ref{fermions})
It is sufficient to make three of the $(C + A_q)$ to be W and the fourth H, given that there is only
one C quiver node, so that there are three $(3, \bar{3}, 1)$. Provided that
$(\bar{3}, 3, 1)$ is avoided by the $(C - A_q)$ being H, the remainder
of the three family trinification will be automatic by chiral anomaly cancellation.
Actually, a sufficient condition for three families has been given; it is
necessary only that the difference between the number of $(3 + A_q)$
nodes and the number of $(3 - A_q)$ nodes
which are W is equal to three.

\item{(8)}  The complex scalars of Eq. (\ref{scalars}) must be sufficient for their
vacuum expectation values (VEVs) to spontaneously break
$SU(3)^p \longrightarrow SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_W \times SU(3)_H
\longrightarrow SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_W \times U(1)_Y \longrightarrow SU(3)_C \times U(1)_Q$.

Note that, unlike grand unified theories (GUTs) with or without supersymmetry,
the Higgs scalars are here prescribed by the conformality condition.
This is more satisfactory because it implies that the Higgs sector cannot be chosen
arbitrarily, but it does make model building more interesting

\item{(9)} Gauge coupling unification should apply at least to the electroweak mixing
angle ${\rm sin}^2 \theta = g_Y^2 / (g_2^2 + g_Y^2) \simeq 0.231$. For trinification
$Y = 3^{-1/2} ( - \lambda_{8W} + 2\lambda_{8H})$ so that $(3/5)^{1/2} Y$ is
correctly normalized. If we make $g_Y^2 = (3/5)g_1^2$ and $g_2^2 = 2 g_1^2$
then ${\rm sin}^2 \theta = 3/13 \simeq 0.231$ with sufficient accuracy.

1,"\begin{itemize}

\item{{\bf p = 2}}

In this case $\alpha = -1$ and therefore one cannot
costruct any complex {\bf 4} of $SU(4)$ with
${\bf 4} \not\equiv {\bf 4^*}$.
Chiral fermions are therefore
impossible.

\item{{\bf p = 3}}

The only possibilities are $A_q = (1, 1, 1, 0)$ or $A_q = (1, 1, -1, -1)$.
The latter is real and leads to no chiral fermions.
The former leaves $N = 1$ supersymmetry and is a simple three-family
model\cite{KS} by the quiver node identification C - W - H. The scalars $a_j = (1, 1, 1)$
are sufficient to spontaneously break to the SM. Gauge coupling unification is, however,
missing since ${\rm sin}^2 \theta = 3/8$, in
bad disagreement with experiment.

\item{{\bf p = 4}}

The only complex $N = 0$ choice is $A_q = (1, 1, 1, 1)$. But
then $a_j = (2, 2, 2)$ and any quiver node identification
such as C - W - H - H has 4 families and the scalars are insufficient to
break spontaneously the symmetry to the SM gauge group.

\item{{\bf p = 5}}

The two inequivalent complex choices are $A_q = (1, 1, 1, 2)$ and $A_q = (1, 3, 3, 3)$.
By drawing the quiver, however, and using the rules
for three chiral families given in (7)
above, one finds that the node identification and the prescription of the scalars
as $a_j = (2, 2, 2)$ and $a_j = (1, 1, 1)$ respectively does not permit
spontaneous breaking to the standard model.

\item{{\bf p = 6}}

Here we can discuss three inequivalent complex possibilities as follows:

\noindent (6A) $A_q = (1, 1, 1, 3)$ which implies $a_j = (2, 2, 2)$.

\bigskip

\noindent Requiring three families means a node identification C - W - X - H - X - H
where X is either W or H. But whatever we choose for the X the scalar representations
are insufficient to break $SU(3)^6$ in the desired fashion down to the SM. This
illustrates the difficulty of model building when the scalars are not
in arbitrary representations.

\noindent (6B) $A_q = (1, 1, 2, 2)$ which implies $a_j = (2, 3, 3)$.

\bigskip

\noindent
Here the family number can be only zero, two or four as can be seen by inspection
of the $A_q$ and the related quiver diagram. So (6B) is of no phenomenological interest.

\noindent (6C) $A_q = (1, 3, 4, 4)$ which implies $a_j = (1, 1, 4)$.

\bigskip

\noindent Requiring three families needs a quiver node identification which is of the form
{\it either}
C - W - H - H - W - H {\it or} C - H - H - W - W - H. The scalar representations
implied by $a_j = (1, 1, 4)$ are, however, easily seen to be insufficient to do the required
spontaneous symmetry breaking (S.S.B.) for both of these identifications.

\item{{\bf p =7}}

Having been stymied mainly by the rigidity of the scalar representation
for all $p \leq 6$, for $p = 7$ there
are the first cases which work. Six inequivalent complex embeddings of $Z_7
\subset SU(4)$ require consideration.

\noindent (7A) $A_q = (1, 1, 1, 4) \Longrightarrow a_j = (2, 2, 2)$

\bigskip

For the required nodes C - W - X - H - H - X - H the
scalars are {\it insufficient} for S.S.B.

\bigskip

\noindent (7B) $A_q = (1, 1, 2, 3) \Longrightarrow a_j = (2, 3, 3)$

\bigskip

The node identification C - W - H - W - H - H - H leads
to a {\it successful} model.

\bigskip

\noindent (7C) $A_q = (1, 2, 2, 2) \Longrightarrow a_j = (3, 3, 3)$

\bigskip

Choosing C - H - W - X - X - H - H to derive three families, the
scalars {\it fail} in S.S.B.

\bigskip

\noindent (7D) $A_q = (1, 3, 5, 5) \Longrightarrow a_j = (1, 1, 3)$

\bigskip

The node choice C - W - H - H - H - W - H leads
to a {\it successful} model. This is Model A of \cite{F2}.

\bigskip

\noindent (7E) $A_q = (1, 4, 4, 5) \Longrightarrow a_j = (1, 2, 2)$

\bigskip

The nodes C - H - H - H - W - W - H are
{\it successful}.

\bigskip

\noindent (7F) $A_q = (2, 4, 4, 4) \Longrightarrow a_j = (1, 1, 1)$

\bigskip

Scalars {\it insufficient} for S.S.B.
