Also from the point of view of numerical
 simulations the situation is not better, since
the lattice formulation of Chern-Simons field theories
encountered so far many obstacles \cite{Bietenholz:2002mt,Berruto:2000dp}.

In order to solve these problems, 
we rewrite the action of
multi-Chern-Simons field theories
with the help of
a Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation and successively eliminate the Chern-Simons fields.
The resulting field theories
contain only scalar fields and
a set of auxiliary
fields which have no dynamics. 
The procedure used is quite general, although it has been developed
for the special multi-Chern-Simons field theories which are relevant to
polymers.
Exploiting the new formulation of the polymer partition function,
we are able to prove that there are not
ambiguities in the field theoretical description of polymer systems,
because all the possible domains in which the coupling constants
$\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_\Gamma$
may be
defined lead to equivalent models. Finally,
we clarify the physical meaning of these coupling constants: They play the
role of Lagrange multipliers. The constraints which they impose are explicitly
computed.

The material presented in this paper is divided as follows.
In Section 2 we consider an action with two Chern-Simons
fields coupled with multiplets of charged scalar fields which are 
invariant
under a $U(n_1)\times U(n_2)$ group of global symmetry.
The relations of this model with the statistical mechanics of two
topologically linked polymers have been
discussed in details in \cite{Ferrari:ts,Ferrari:yz} and
are here only briefly summarized.
Starting from this simple example of
multi-Chern-Simons field theories,
we illustrate the problems which arise in polymer models.
In Section 3 it is shown how it is possible to eliminate
the Chern-Simons fields using a suitable Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.
In this way we obtain an expression of the partition
function of polymers in terms of the topological numbers $m_{ij}$
in which the action is polynomial in the fields. In previous approaches,
instead, the action contained non-polynomial and non-local terms.
In Section 4
we check that the
non-uniqueness  of the domain of integration of the coupling constants
disappears
due to a symmetry which was hidden in the original formulation in terms
of Chern-Simons fields.
Finally, in Sections 5 and 6
these results are generalized to the case of multi-Chern-Simons
field theories describing the statistical mechanics of an arbitrary
number of polymers.


\section{The Two-Polymers Model}
Let us consider the action:
\begin{eqnarray}
S(\lambda)&=&
\int d^3x\left[ %\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}
\imath\kappa\mbox{\bf B}\cdot(\mbox{\boldmath $\nabla$}\times \mbox{\bf A})+
|(\mbox{\boldmath $\nabla$}-\imath\kappa\mbox{\bf B})\Psi_1|^2+m_1^2|\Psi_1|^2\right]  
\nonumber\\
&+&\int d^3x\left[|(\mbox{\boldmath $\nabla$}-\imath\lambda\mbox{\bf A})\Psi_2|^2+m_2^2|\Psi_2|^2\right]
\label{acttwo}
\end{eqnarray}
In Eq.~(\ref{acttwo}) $\imath=\sqrt{-1}$ and
the symbols $\Psi_i,\Psi_i^*$, $i=1,2$, denote
multiplets of charged fields:"
