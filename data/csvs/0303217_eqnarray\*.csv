The tensorial form of the first state is dictated by $L_{2}$,
which is obtained from the anticommutator of $G_2$ and $G_0$. As
mentioned earlier, the same $L_2$ prohibits states with higher
oscillators of the form $\alpha_{-3}^{i}\mid0\rangle$, The forms
of the second and fourth states are determined by the action of
$G_{2}$. Finally, only the combination
\[
\sqrt{3}\mid3\rangle + \mid4\rangle,  {\bf 56_{v}}
\]
obeys $G_0\mid\phi\rangle = \sqrt{3}\mid\phi\rangle $.

\subsection{Ramond spectrum:}

The physical states in the Ramond sector must satisfy


\begin{eqnarray}
F_{2m+1}\mid\psi\rangle&=&0,   m>0\\
L_{2n}\mid\psi\rangle&=&0,   n>0\\
(L_{0}+1)\mid\psi\rangle&=&0.
\end{eqnarray}
However, using the superalgebra (72-76), one can see that these
infinite set of conditions can be reduced to just the $F_1$, $ F_3$
and $L_0$ constraints.  In addition, taking the square root of
(76), we have an $f_0$ constraint which simplifies to
\begin{equation}
(\Gamma^0 + I)\mid\psi\rangle = 0.
\end{equation}

This is what remains of the Dirac equation.  We must now discuss
the properties of the Ramond ground state $\mid\psi\rangle$ and
the meaning of (94).

Majorana spinors with 16 components (and depending on 16 real
parameters) are allowed in our $(8,1)$ Minkowski space-time.
These 16 components consist of linear combinations of the two
independent $SO(8)$ spinors, which we will denote by ${\bf 8_{s}}$
and ${\bf 8_{c}}$.  These are projected out of a 16-component
spinor by the operators $(\Gamma^0 + I)$ and $(\Gamma^0 - I)$,
respectively.  Thus (94) indeed serves as a Dirac equation in
halving the number of independent components.

We now apply combinations of creation operators with $N=0,1,2$ on
ground states $\mid\psi_0\rangle$, and then obtain the physically
allowed combinations by imposing the $F_{1}, F_{3},  L_0$ and $f_0$
conditions:


\begin{itemize}
\item $N=0, \alpha'_{ND}M^{2}=1$
\[
\mid0\rangle \equiv \mid\psi_{\beta}\rangle, \psi_{\beta} \sim
{\bf 8_{s}}
\]
Note the $f_0$ constraint (94) has eliminated ${\bf 8_{c}}$ and kept
${\bf 8_{s}}$.
\item $N=1, \alpha'_{ND}M^{2}=2$
\[
\mid1\rangle \equiv \mid\psi^{ij}_{\beta'}\rangle \equiv
(\alpha_{-1}^{i}d_{0}^{j}+\alpha_{-1}^{j}d_{0}^{i}-
\frac{\delta^{ij}}{D-1}\alpha_{-1}^{k}d_{0}^{k})
\mid\psi_{\beta'}\rangle \sim {\bf 35_{v}\otimes \bf 8_{c}}
\]
is the only permissible combination.
Imposing $(\Gamma^0 + I)\mid1\rangle = 0$
forces $\mid\psi_{\beta'}\rangle$ to be ${\bf 8_{c}}$  since $\Gamma^0$
anticommutes with $d^{i}_{0}$.
\item $N=2,\alpha'_{ND}M^{2}=3$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mid\psi^{ij}_{\beta}(\alpha \alpha)\rangle
+\mid\psi^{ij}_{\beta}(dd)\rangle &\equiv&
(\alpha_{-1}^{i}\alpha_{-1}^{j}-\frac{\delta^{ij}}
{D-1}\alpha_{-1}^{k}\alpha_{-1}^{k}\\&-&d_{-2}^{i}d_{0}^{j}-
d_{-2}^{j}d_{0}^{i}+\frac{2\delta^{ij}}{D-1}d_{-2}^{k}d_{0}^{k})
\mid\psi_{\beta}\rangle,\sim {\bf 35_{v}\otimes\bf 8_{s}}
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{itemize}

The $\alpha \alpha$ and $dd$ parts of this separately satisfy the
Virasoro constraints (92) and (93), but the superconstraints (91) force
them into this particular combination. Because of the even number
of $d$ modes, the basic spinor is ${\bf 8_{s}}$.
The $SO(8)$ transformation properties of these states have been indicated
above, but one must be careful in distinguishing between these boldface
numbers and the actual physical degrees of freedom (the
NS spectrum, where the boldface numbers are identical with the
number of physical states, is free of this complication).
The R-sector $SO(8)$ generators are built out of $\alpha^{i}_{n}$'s
and $d^{i}_{n}$'s, and thus transform the R-states exactly as indicated as
in boldface.  However, a look at the $N=1$ state shows that we cannot be
dealing with 35x8 physical states: the $d^{i}_{0}$ merely shuffle the 8
components of the ground state spinor.  Thus we have at most 8x8 = 64
states, but since the tensor is traceless, 8 spinor components
corresponding to $\psi^{ii}_{\beta'}$ are absent, and the true physical
content is ${\bf {56}_{s}}$.  This is not as unfamiliar a situation as it
might first appear: consider a scalar field $\theta$ and its gradient
$\partial_{\mu}\theta$.  The latter transforms as a $D$-vector, but the
physical degree of freedom is still just $\theta$, which is a $D$-scalar.

Examining the physical content of the $N=2$ states, we see that
$\mid\psi^{ij}_{\beta}(\alpha \alpha)\rangle$ contains 35x8 = 280 states,
but these do not belong to a single irrep.  Among the 280 states there is
a ${\bf {56}_c}$ of the form $d^{i}_{0}\mid\psi^{ij}_{\beta}(\alpha
\alpha)\rangle$ and the rest is ${\bf {224}_c}$.  The part
$\mid\psi^{ij}_{\beta}(dd)\rangle $ represents another ${\bf {56}_c}$,
because the $d^{i}_{0}$ does not increase the number of states
(bringing the number down from 280 to 64) and tracelessness in $ij$
takes off another 8.  Thus the $N=2$ content is ${\bf {224}_c}+{\bf
{56}_c} + {\bf {56}_c}$.  Counting the $\alpha$ and $d$ modes separately
and adding the numbers may seem surprising, but it is again not new: in
the Higgs phenomenon, the massless photon field $A_{\mu}$ and
$\partial_{\mu}\theta$ are added to form the massive vector
field $B_{\mu}$.  Although all three formally transform as 4-vectors,
the final $B_{\mu}$ has 2+1 = 3 degrees of freedom.

\section{Discussion}

Our concern in this note has been twofold: The first was to see whether an
RNS string with one fixed end would provide qualitative
phenomenological hints and distinctive signatures about the spectrum of
hadrons with one very heavy quark.  The second concern was the more formal
one of working out the novel consequences of the unusual mixed
Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions and seeing  whether the
resulting system can be quantized in a consistent way. Just as in the
original attempts to apply string theory to hadrons, these two aims are
partially in conflict, most notably in the dimension of space-time.

Ignoring this conflict as was customarily done in the old string-based
hadrodynamics, we can summarize the predictions of our model as follows:
(i) There is no
space-time supersymmetry except for the fact that meson and baryon Regge
trajectories have the same slope, leading to equal meson and baryon masses
for the higher states. (ii)  The Regge slope is twice that of the one
observed for lighter hadrons. (iii) There are no daughter trajectories,
which means the number of states at mass $\sqrt N$ behave asymptotically
as const. $N^{D-1}$ (in keeping with the policy of disregarding
unrealistic demands of the model whenever inconvenient, $D-1$ presumably
has to be taken as 3 rather than 8), rather than the $e^{\sqrt N}$
behavior seen for ordinary hadrons.  An interesting point here is that if
we consider an interaction where the free
ends of two of our strings  join  while the heavy quark ends are kept
fixed, we are led to a model in which $X^{\mu}\sim \Sigma
\alpha_{n}^{\mu}e^{-in{\tau}}sin(n\sigma)$ with $\sigma$ in the range
$[0,\pi]$.  For such strings with both ends fixed on $D0$-branes, all
$\alpha_n$ modes and, consequently, all $L_n$ are allowed.  In this
sector, there will be ``daughter excitations"", with the same spin but
equally spaced masses. but not in the sense there
are any leading linear Regge trajectories above them (the latter cannot be
present  because the
balancing of centrifugal force against tension in a rigid rotation
mode that defines leading trajectories is imposible when both
ends are fixed). This is in qualitative, and one hopes, not entirely
fortuitous  accord with the multiplicity of
$b\overline{b}$ and $c\overline{c}$ states of spin one. In any case,
the Coulomb part of the QCD potential is known to play an
important role in the dynamics of heavy quark-antiquark systems, ensuring
deviations from a mass spectrum based on the purely string-based picture.

Turning to string-theoretic issues, we start with the question of whether
using the more conventional $\sigma$ range $[0,\pi]$ would have made a
physical difference. One may  anticipate that the simultaneous doubling of
the $\sigma$ range and the
halving of the mode index $n$ will result in an equivalent physical
system,
and this is indeed what happens.  The mixed boundary conditions now produce
half-integral $\alpha$ and $b$ modes and integral Ramond $d$ modes, but
the allowed physical spectrum is exactly as the one above except for an
overall scaling.  In particular, the vanishing of the NS vacuum energy
and the preference for a $(8,1)$ space-time and $SO(8)$ symmetry remain.
We
prefer working with odd $\alpha$ and $b$ and even $d$ modes because this
leads to the disappearence of odd $L_n$'s.  We have broken
Poincar\'{e} invariance by fixing one end of the string at a
special point in space; this is consistent with discarding the
operators  $L_1$ and $L_{-1}$ which involve the generator of space
translations.

The GSO projection turns out to be inapplicable to the mixed boundary
condition superstring.
This is already suggested by the fact that low-lying states do
not exhibit space-time supersymmetry beyond matching masses and Regge slopes
in the two sectors, but there are more basic manifestations of the
incompatibility. For example, our final physical states are not
homogeneous in the number of
space-time fermions.  Furthermore, in the R-sector we already have
the remnant Dirac equation operators $\Gamma^0 \pm I$, but not in the role
they play in the GSO projection. Since the mode structure here is
different from the standard RNS string (for example, our $b$ operators
add an integer rather than half  an integer to the squared mass), one
could not in any case have expected the GSO procedure to work in the usual
way.
