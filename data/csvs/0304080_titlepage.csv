\begin{abstract}
Extending a computation which appeared recently in \cite{Motl:2003cd}, we compute the transmission and 
reflection coefficients for massless uncharged scalars and gravitational waves scattered by $d \ge 4$ 
Schwarzschild or $d=4$ Reissner-Nordstr\o{}m\xspace black holes, in the limit of large imaginary frequencies.  The transmission
coefficient has an interpretation as the ``greybody factor'' which determines the spectrum
of Hawking radiation.  The result has an interesting structure and we 
speculate that it may admit a simple dual
description; curiously, for Reissner-Nordstr\o{}m\xspace the result suggests that this dual description should
involve both the inner and outer horizons.  We also discuss some numerical evidence in favor 
of the formulas of \cite{Motl:2003cd}.
