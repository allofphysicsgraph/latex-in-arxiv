The light-front quantization of gauge theories in light-cone gauge
provides a frame-independent
wavefunction representation of relativistic bound states, simple
forms for current matrix elements, explicit unitary, and a trivial
vacuum.  The light-front Hamiltonian form of QCD
provides an alternative to lattice gauge theory for the computation of
nonperturbative quantities such as the hadronic spectrum and  the
corresponding eigenfunctions.  In the case of the electroweak
theory, spontaneous symmetry breaking is represented by the
appearance of zero modes of the Higgs field.  Light-front
quantization then leads to an elegant ghost-free theory of massive
gauge particles, automatically incorporating the Lorentz and 't
Hooft conditions, as well as the Goldstone boson equivalence
theorem.
