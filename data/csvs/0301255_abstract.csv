We point out that the worldvolume coordinate functions 
$\hat{x}^\mu(\xi)$ of a $p$-brane interacting with dynamical gravity 
are Goldstone fields for spacetime diffeomorphisms gauge 
symmetry. The presence of this gauge invariance is exhibited by 
its associated Noether identity, which expresses that 
the source equations follow from the gravitational equations.
We discuss the spacetime counterpart of the Higgs 
effect and show that a $p$-brane does not carry any local 
degrees of freedom, extending early known general relativity 
features. Our considerations are also relevant for brane 
world scenarios.
