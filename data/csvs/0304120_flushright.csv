\centerline{\bf Abstract}\vspace{0.3mm}
Boundary integrable models with $N=2$ supersymmetry are considered. For the simplest boundary $N=2$ superconformal minimal
model with a Chebyshev bulk perturbation 
we show explicitly how fermionic boundary degrees of freedom arise naturally in
the boundary perturbation in order to maintain integrability and $N=2$ supersymmetry. A new boundary reflection matrix is obtained for this model and $N=2$ boundary superalgebra is studied. A factorized scattering theory is proposed for a $N=2$ supersymmetric extension of the boundary sine-Gordon model with either $(i)$ fermionic or $(ii)$ bosonic and fermionic boundary degrees of freedom. Exact results are obtained for some quantum impurity problems: the boundary scaling Lee-Yang model, a massive deformation of the anisotropic Kondo model at the filling values $g=2/(2n+3)$ and the boundary Ashkin-Teller model.

\section{Introduction}
In superstring theory, it has recently been shown that certain backgrounds are associated with two-dimensional integrable massive field theories on the worldsheet \cite{Malda,tseyt}. For instance, the sine-Gordon model at its $N=2$ supersymmetric point \cite{Vaf93} corresponds to the simplest generalization of the pp-wave background \cite{Gomez} and the $N=2$ supersymmetric sine-Gordon model \cite{Uematsu} was suggested as a good string background \cite{Malda}. Similarly, for open superstrings boundary integrable models with $N=2$ supersymmetry arise naturally \cite{Hori,Yama}. Exact results
for such integrable field theories are then desirable. 

In statistical physics, several low-dimensional systems around their critical points possess a description in terms of two-dimensional integrable boundary  quantum field theories. Among the famous examples, one finds the Kondo model 
which describes the s-wave scattering of electrons off a magnetic spin impurity.
Another example corresponds to free fermions on the half-line  which describes the scattering of fermions off a monopole (Callan-Rubakov effect). Also, minimal models and their extensions (with $N=1,2$ supersymmetry or $W$-symmetry) arise in quantum impurity problems. Although nonperturbative results for (pure) bulk perturbation can be derived using certain quantum group restrictions of  (super)sine-Gordon, Bullough-Dodd or more generally affine Toda models, in case of an integrable boundary perturbation such a relation is still an open problem which needs further analysis. 

As explained in \cite{GZ,Warn}, a boundary perturbation of a massive
integrable quantum field theory will
preserve integrability if the perturbing boundary operator possesses a 
representation with respect to the underlying chiral algebra on the
half-plane\,\footnote{This can be shown in first order of conformal
perturbation theory. If operators are very relevant, scaling arguments 
can be used to show that local conserved currents exists at all
orders in conformal perturbation theory.} {\it and} provided it belongs to the same representation than 
the bulk potential. It is important to mention that \cite{Cardy} the choice of
conformal boundary conditions plays a crucial role as it restricts the
representations of the boundary operators. 

Among the simplest known examples, one finds the critical Ising
field theory (with central charge $c=1/2$) perturbed by the energy
operator  in the bulk ($\Phi_{13}$ representation of the Virasoro
algebra) \cite{Zam89}. Due to the argument \cite{GZ} recalled above, it follows
that a boundary operator in the $\Phi_{13}$ representation leads to a
boundary integrable model. Indeed, from the fusion rule of the spin
operator $\sigma\sigma\rightarrow {\mathbb{I}}+\Phi_{13}$ a boundary
integrable model can be constructed as an off-critical Ising model
restricted on the half-line with free conformal boundary conditions
perturbed by a boundary spin operator coupled with one fermionic boundary degree 
of freedom \cite{GZ}. 

As mentionned in \cite{Warn}, it would be interesting to construct a
 nontrivial boundary integrable perturbation of a critical Ising 
field theory on the half-line perturbed by a relevant magnetic operator in
the bulk ($\Phi_{12}$ representation). Indeed, if one starts with
standard boundary conditions (free or fixed), one simply cannot obtain 
a boundary operator in the representation of the Virasoro
algebra \cite{Cardy}. Starting from certain boundary conditions
changing operators \cite{Cardy}, it is however expected that one might
be able to construct a well-defined boundary operator that preserves
integrability. But in this case, the underlying boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) with these
special boundary conditions has to be identified, which remains an
open question. In order to solve this problem, it has been pointed out 
that introducing new degrees of freedom located at the boundary might
provide a useful tool.

In both previous examples, a perturbed boundary minimal model (critical
Ising field theory) is considered for which the
representations of the Virasoro algebra (labeled by the conformal
weights) are in finite number. Fusion rules then restrict drastically
the number of models that can be constructed\,\footnote{For
boundary conformal field theories with higher
symmetries such as $W$-minimal models \cite{FateevLukyanov}, ${\mathbb Z}_n$ 
models \cite{FateevZamolodchikov},... the same situation occurs. For a discussion about
the relation between boundary Toda models with imaginary coupling and
perturbed boundary $W$-minimal models, see for instance
\cite{Warn}.}. It is probably one reason why the presence of boundary 
degrees of freedom seems to be sometimes necessary. 

On the other hand, we may now wonder if boundary degrees of freedom occur in case of BCFTs with a continuous serie of representations like the Liouville
or, more generally, Toda field theories perturbed simultaneously by bulk 
and
boundary operators in the same representation. An
interesting example is provided by the sine-Gordon (SG) field theory on the
half-line  without \cite{Sklyanin,GZ} or with \cite{BasDel,BK}
degrees of  freedom at the boundary. In full 
generality, we define its Euclidean action as:
%
\begin{eqnarray} {\cal A}_{bSG}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dy\int_{-\infty}^{0}dx
\Big(\frac{1}{8\pi}(\partial_\nu\phi)^2-2\mu\cos(\hat{\beta}\phi)\Big)
+ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dy\ \Phi_{pert}^{B}(y)\ + \
{\cal A}_{boundary} \label{actionSG} \end{eqnarray}
%
where the interaction between the SG field and the
boundary terms \ ${\cal E}_\pm(y)$ \ with dimension \ $\sim \mu^{1/2}$ 
\ reads
%
\begin{eqnarray*} \Phi_{pert}^{B}(y) \ =\ {\cal E}_-(y) e^{i\hat{\beta}\phi(0,y)/2}
+ {\cal E}_+(y) e^{-i\hat{\beta}\phi(0,y)/2}\ . \end{eqnarray*}
%
Here we used the notation $\hat{\beta}=\beta/\sqrt{4\pi}$ and introduced
the UV mass parameter $\mu$. The last term only depends on the
boundary degrees of freedom, and is only considered if necessary.

If there are no
degrees of freedom at the boundary, the terms \ ${\cal
E}_{\pm}(y)\sim Const.$ \ are just $c$-numbers and we set \ 
 ${\cal A}_{boundary}\equiv 0$ \ in (\ref{actionSG}). This two-parameter
family\,\footnote{Only boundary parameters are mentionned here. The
bulk mass is sometimes considered as a third (bulk) parameter.} of boundary 
integrable models have
been studied in details since many years, for which exact results
\cite{GZ,Gho94,Fri95,Fen94,Sal95,Sko95,Lec95,Fat97,
Dor99,Cor98,Cor99,Cor00,Dor00,Baj02,Mat} have been confirmed using various methods. This model can be
 considered as an integrable
perturbation of the boundary Liouville field theory as suggested in
\cite{FZZ}. Using vertex
operators representations \cite{FZZ,dots,Schulze,Kawai}, it is not difficult to
see in (\ref{actionSG}) that the boundary perturbing operators are
indeed in the same representation than the
bulk ones (for identical bulk and boundary background charges). Without boundary degrees of freedom, the UV limit of the boundary SG 
model defined in (\ref{actionSG}) can be identified either with the Gaussian field with Neumann boundary conditions or with the boundary Liouville field theory as considered in \cite{FZZ}. 
 
For certain degrees of freedom at the boundary and generic values of the coupling $\hat{\beta}$, the classical
Hamiltonian  associated with the model (\ref{actionSG}) above is
integrable \cite{BasDel}. At quantum level, integrability is
preserved \cite{BK} for   
%
\begin{eqnarray} {\cal E}_+(y)=\pm 2e_{UV}\frac{1-\hat{\beta}^2}{\hat{\beta}^2}\cosh\hat{p}(y) \ \ \ \ \ 
\mbox{and}\ \ \ \ \
{\cal E}_-(y)=\pm 2e_{UV}\frac{1-\hat{\beta}^2}{\hat{\beta}^2}\cosh\hat{q}(y) \label{bop}
\end{eqnarray}
%
with \ $\big[\hat{p}(\pm \infty),\hat{q}(\pm \infty)
\big]=\alpha\ mod\ (4i \pi)$ \ and \ $e_{UV}$ \ is a boundary mass parameter. Depending on each sign in (\ref{bop}), the boundary quantization length \  $\alpha/i$ 
\ associated with the boundary quantum mechanical system is fixed to
%
\begin{eqnarray} \alpha=i4\pi\frac{(\hat{\beta}^2-1)}{\hat{\beta}^2}
\quad (+) \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \ \ \ \ \alpha=i
2\pi\frac{(\hat{\beta}^2-2)}{\hat{\beta}^2} \quad (-)\ .\label{relat} \end{eqnarray}
%
Introducing a ``dynamical'' extension \cite{BK} of the Cartan subalgebra (identified with the topological
charge in the SG model) and using the boundary quantum group structure discovered in \cite{coidnepo}\footnote{This structure has been further studied in \cite{delmac,ba,del2} for which new reflection matrices associated with non-dynamical boundary have been obtained.} 
(coideal subalgebra of $U_q(\widehat{sl_2})$), we obtained the 
soliton/antisoliton and breathers boundary reflection matrices. 
In particular, for generic values of the coupling $\hat{\beta}$,
we found that the bulk and the boundary masses are locked
together\,\footnote{The UV parameter  $e_{UV}$ is fixed by the boundary non-local
conserved charges algebraic structure in terms of the bulk UV mass parameter $\mu$. Although
not shown explictly, Warner predicted such phenomena \cite{Warn}.}. We refer the reader to
\cite{BK} for more details.

For generic values of the coupling $\hat{\beta}$, this model deserves
certainly some interest, but taking some special values provides interesting new insights as we are going to show. Indeed, for \ $\hat{\beta}^2=2p/p'$ \ with \ $0<p<p'$ \ integers the bulk SG model is known to be related with the $\Phi_{13}$ bulk perturbation of minimal models. Furthermore, at the special point $\hat{\beta}^2=4/3$ (repulsive regime) it describes an integrable bulk perturbation (Chebyshev type) of $N=2$ superconformal minimal model. The SG model with boundary degrees of freedom introduced and studied in \cite{BK} being the most general boundary integrable perturbation of the bulk SG model, it is important to analyse in details these special points.

In this paper we will focus on $\hat{\beta}^2=4/(2n+3)$, \ $n\in {\mathbb N}$ in (\ref{actionSG}) for several reasons. First, it will provide new examples of perturbed conformal field theories with boundary degrees of freedom for which the factorized scattering theory is proposed.  
Secondly, for generic values of the coupling $\hat{\beta}$ 
the model (\ref{actionSG}) only possesses one free parameter (the bulk mass). It is important to see if different boundary operators ${\cal E}_\pm(y)$
preserving  integability can be constructed at these special points
for which new free parameters may appear. Third, for $n=0$  a massive $N=2$ boundary supersymmetry algebra appears explicitly.

The paper is organized as follow. In the next section, we exhibit an exact relation between  the simplest bulk-boundary perturbed $N=2$ superconformal minimal model and the sine-Gordon model at special point $\hat{\beta}=4/3$ with fermionic boundary degrees of freedom. It shows that, similarly to the
critical Ising model in a boundary magnetic field, boundary degrees of 
freedom appear naturally in this model. 
The boundary supersymmetric charges are explicitly constructed from the Lagrangean and differ from the ones proposed in \cite{Warn,Nepo2}.
Although their expressions are similar to the ones in \cite{Nepo2} (which may probably be considered as ``effective'' supersymmetry charges in terms of the boundary structure) the main difference here is the fermionic boundary algebra
that appears associated with the fermion number operator. 
These supersymmetry charges are used to construct a new boundary reflection matrix with $N=2$ supersymmetry which possesses two free parameters and is shown to satisfy the boundary Yang-Baxter equations. The corresponding massive $N=2$ boundary superalgebra is constructed and the boundary free energy is proposed. 
In section 3, a boundary scattering associated with a $N=2$ supersymmetric version of the boundary sine-Gordon model with purely fermionic (proposed in \cite{Nepo1}) or a mixing of fermionic and bosonic boundary degrees of freedom is proposed. In any case, the supersymmetric part is different from the one suggested in \cite{Warn,Nepo2}.  In section 4, we present applications of our results to quantum impurity problems. The boundary scaling Lee-Yang model is revisited in light of our results. The anisotropic Kondo model is shown to admit a simple massive integrable extension at special points $g=2/(2n+3)$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$, for which scattering amplitudes are proposed. Finally, a boundary version of the Ashkin-Teller model is briefly presented.

\section{$N=2$ supersymmetry in the boundary sine-Gordon model}
%
Among the class of relevant perturbation of $N=2$ superconformal
minimal model with central charge $c=3\ell/\ell+2$, the ones corresponding
to integrable $N=2$ supersymmetric field theories have been studied in 
details \cite{9}. Three different types of relevant bulk perturbations can be
considered. Here, we focus on the model associated with a perturbation 
of the form (the so-called Chebyshev perturbation):
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi_{pert}^{bulk}(z,\zbar)= {{\hat\lambda}} \
G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^-{\overline{G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^-}}\Phi_k^+(z,\zbar)\ \  +
\ \ {\overline {\hat\lambda}} \
G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^+{\overline{G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^+}}\Phi_k^-(z,\zbar)\ ,\label{pertbulk} 
\end{eqnarray}
%
where ${{\hat\lambda}}$ is a complex parameter that characterizes the
strength of the perturbation. The chiral primary fields $\Phi_k^\pm$
possess conformal dimensions \ $\Delta_k={\overline \Delta_k}=k/2(\ell+2)$ \ 
and \ $G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^\pm$ $({\overline{G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^-}})$ \ are
$N=2$ supersymmetry generators. Actually, this perturbation is known to be
the $N=2$ superconformal analogue of the energy perturbation
of the ordinary critical Ising model. Following the case of the
off-critical Ising model in a boundary magnetic field \cite{GZ} and in order
to maintain supersymmetry (see details in \cite{Warn}), it is then
natural to consider the model with the bulk perturbation
(\ref{pertbulk}) on the half-line and a boundary perturbation of the
form \cite{Warn}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi_{pert}^{boundary}(y)= \mu_B e^{-i\phi_0/{\sqrt 3}}\ \nu^{\bold{uv}}_-(y)\ 
G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^-{\hat{\Phi}_k}^+(y)\ \ 
+\ \ \mu_B e^{i\phi_0/{\sqrt 3}} \ \nu^{\bold{uv}}_+(y)\ G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^+{\hat{\Phi}_k}^-(y)
\ .\label{pertboundary} 
\end{eqnarray}
%
Here ${G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^\mp}{\hat\Phi_k}^\pm(y)$ are boundary operators in
the same $N=2$ superconformal representation as the bulk operators, $\phi_0$ is a phase and $\mu_B$ is the boundary mass scale. It 
is important to stress that the resulting model is neither expected to be
integrable nor $N=2$ supersymmetric for any boundary degrees of freedom $\nu^{\bold{uv}}_\pm(y)$. Also, both requirement
must be simultaneously consistent. This can be checked from the
structure of the Lagrangean, but also in the scattering amplitude. To
proceed further, let us consider a concrete example: the sine-Gordon model
at $\hat{\beta}^2=4/3$.
%

%revisited}}\vspace{0.5cm}
%

In the bulk and for $\ell=1$ the simplest $N=2$ superconformal minimal model possesses a Lagrangean representation in terms of a single free boson $\tphi(x,y)$ compactified on the ``supersymmetric'' radius. In terms
of its holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts it reads \ $\tphi(x,y)=\tvphi(z)+\tvphib(\zbar)$ \ with $z=y+ix$ and $\zbar=y-ix$.  If 
we denote the expectation value over the Fock vacuum space of massless fields
 $\langle ... \rangle_0$, then the holomorphic/antiholomorphic components  are normalized such that
%
\begin{eqnarray*} \langle{\tvphi}(z){{\tvphi}}(w)\rangle_0=-\ln(z-w),\quad
\langle{\tvphib}({\bar z}){\tvphib}({\bar w})
\rangle_0=-\ln({\bar z}-{\bar w}),\quad
\langle{\tvphi}(z){\tvphib}({\bar w})
\rangle_0=0\ .\label{correlbulk}
\end{eqnarray*}
%
The $N=2$ supersymmetric generators correspond to the stress-energy
tensor which ensures conformal invariance, the $U(1)$ current and the two supersymmetry generators. Their holomorphic parts read, respectively,
%
\begin{eqnarray}
T(z)=-\frac{1}{2}(\partial_z\tvphi)^2\ ,\qquad \qquad
J(z)=\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}\partial_z\tvphi\ \qquad \mbox{and}\qquad \qquad
G^{\pm}(z)=\exp({\pm i{\sqrt 3}\tvphi(z)})\ .\label{defi}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The order parameter and its conjugate are defined as \ $\Phi^{\pm}_{k=1}(z,\zbar)=\exp({\pm\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}(\tvphi(z)+\tvphib(\zbar)}))$ \ . Using the definitions (\ref{defi}) above,
it follows that the interacting terms in the bulk perturbation 
(\ref{pertbulk}) become
%
\begin{eqnarray}
G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^\pm{\overline{G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^\pm}}
\Phi_k^\mp(z,\zbar)=\exp({\pm\frac{2i}{\sqrt 3}(\tvphi(z)+\tvphib(\zbar)}))\ .
\end{eqnarray}
%

On the half-line, one can use the method of mirror images for Neumann 
boundary conditions \ $\partial_x\tphi(x,y)|_{x=0}=0$ \ i.e. \ one defines \  $\phi(x,y)=\tphi(x,y)+\tphi(-x,y)$. In terms of its holomorphic and antiholomorphic part restricted on the half-line it gives 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\varphi(z)= \tvphi(z) + \tvphib(z) \qquad \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad \qquad
{\overline\varphi}(z)= \tvphib(\zbar) + \tvphi(\zbar)\ .
\end{eqnarray}
%
from which one deduces the two-point functions in the BCFT with Neumann 
boundary conditions 
%
\begin{eqnarray*} \langle{\varphi}(z){{\varphi}}(w)\rangle_0=-2\ln(z-w),\quad
\langle{{\bar\varphi}}({\bar z}){{\bar\varphi}}({\bar
w})\rangle_0=-2\ln({\bar z}-{\bar w}),\quad
\langle{\varphi}(z){{\bar\varphi}}({\bar
w})\rangle_0=-2\ln(z-{\bar w})\ .\label{correl} \end{eqnarray*}
%
In particular, from these definitions\,\footnote{One has \ $\varphi(z)|_{x=0}=\vphib(\zbar)|_{x=0}$ \ which gives \ $\vphi(z)|_{x=0}=\phi(0,y)/2$.} and using the supersymmetric generators restricted on the half-line \ $G^{\pm}(z)=\exp({\pm i{\sqrt 3}
\vphi(z)})$ \ the boundary perturbation becomes 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
G_{-\frac{1}{2}}^\pm\Phi_k^\mp(y)\equiv\exp({\mp\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}
(\vphi(z)+\vphib(\zbar)}))|_{x=0}=\exp({\mp\frac{i}{\sqrt 3}
(\phi(0,y)}))\ .
\end{eqnarray}
%
It follows that the action associated with the simplest $N=2$ boundary superconformal minimal model corresponds to the boundary sine-Gordon model 
(\ref{actionSG}) at the special point $\hat{\beta}^2=4/3$ with the substitutions 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu\  \ \longrightarrow\  \ -{\hat\lambda}\ \ =\ \ -{\overline{\hat\lambda}}\qquad \quad \  \mbox{and} \qquad \quad {\cal E}_{\pm}(y)\  \ \longrightarrow \ \ \mu_Be^{\pm i\phi_0/{\sqrt 3}}\nu^{\bold{uv}}_{\pm}(y)\ .\label{replace}
\end{eqnarray}
%

At the supersymmetric point, the bulk SG model is in the repulsive 
regime (no breathers): the spectrum consists of one soliton and one antisoliton.
In the following, they are denoted \ $|u(\theta)\rangle$ \ and \ $|v(\theta)\rangle$ \ with fermion number \ $+1/2$ \ and \ $-1/2$ \ , respectively and form a two dimensional supermultiplet \cite{BernLecl,Uematsu,FendleyInt}. The corresponding bulk $S$-matrix is known for a long time $\cite{ZZ}$. For general values of the coupling in the SG model, four nonlocal charges with fractional spin and one topological charge generating the $U_q({\widehat {sl_2}})$ affine quantum envelopping algebra exist \cite{BernLecl}.  However, at $\hat{\beta}^2=4/3$ they become local (spin $1/2$) and together with the fermion number operator they generate the massive superalgebra. If $\theta$ denotes the particle rapidity and $M$ its mass, in the supermultiplet representation $\pi_\theta$ they act as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\pi_\theta({{\cal Q}}_{+})|d(\theta)\rangle=
{\sqrt {2M}}e^{\theta/2}|u(\theta)\rangle\
, \qquad 
\pi_\theta({\overline {\cal Q}}_{-})|u(\theta)\rangle=
{\sqrt {2M}}e^{-\theta/2}|d(\theta)\rangle\ ,\\
&&\pi_\theta({{\cal Q}}_{-})|u(\theta)\rangle=
{\sqrt {2M}}e^{\theta/2}|d(\theta)\rangle\
, \qquad
\pi_\theta({\overline {\cal Q}}_{+})|d(\theta)\rangle=
{\sqrt {2M}}e^{-\theta/2}|u(\theta)\rangle\ \label{rep}
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
and 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
F|u(\theta)\rangle=\frac{1}{2}|u(\theta)\rangle \ , \qquad \qquad F|d(\theta)\rangle=-\frac{1}{2}|d(\theta)\rangle \ .
\end{eqnarray}
%
Using this representation, the massive superalgebra can be constructed \cite{WittenOlive,Uematsu,FendleyInt} in terms of the Hamiltonian $H$, momentum $P$ and particle number ${\cal N}$ with eigenvalues on one-particle states $E=M\cosh(\theta)$,
$P=M\sinh(\theta)$ and 1 or 0, respectively. Using the definition of the coproduct \cite{Uematsu,FendleyInt} which acts on multiparticle states one 
can check that the bulk $S$-matrix commutes with these supercharges and the fermion number operator.

If we now consider the SG model on the half-line at the special value 
$\hat{\beta}^2=4/3$ as defined above (\ref{actionSG}), using the results of 
\cite{BK} together with a scale transformation it follows that the boundary supercharges 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
{\hat {\cal Q}}_{\pm}={\cal Q}_{\pm}+{\bar {\cal Q}}_{\mp}+{\hat\nu}^{\bold{ir}}_{\pm}(-1)^{F}\ \label{bsusy} \qquad \quad \mbox{with} \qquad \quad {\hat\nu}^{\bold{ir}}_{\pm}=\mp \frac{2{\sqrt M}}{k}{\nu}^{\bold{ir}}_{\pm}\label{susycharges}
\end{eqnarray}
%
 are conserved\,\footnote{To do that, one uses the local expression of the supercharges in terms of the field and derives their conservation in first order of conformal perturbation theory. Using scaling arguments, it can be shown that this is true at all orders too, which allows to define them asymptotically i.e. in the IR limit.}. Here $k$ denotes a real parameter.
 To relate the IR and UV data (using the relation in the UV of the sine-Gordon non-local charges and the supercharges), asymptotically  we have assumed the boundary conditions for the operators 
 $\nu^{\bold{uv}}_{\pm}(y)$ at both ``ends'' of the boundary:  
%
\begin{eqnarray} \nu^{\bold{uv}}_{+}(y=\pm\infty)\sim\nu^{\bold{ir}}_{+}\qquad \qquad \mbox{and}\qquad \qquad \nu^{\bold{uv}}_{-}(y=\pm\infty)\sim\nu^{\bold{ir}}_{-}\ .\label{opcond}\end{eqnarray}
%  
Similarly to the boundary SG model with  boundary degrees of freedom, the asymptotic boundary operators $\nu^{\bold{ir}}_{\pm}$ commute with the 
massive (bulk) $N=2$ superalgebra. Thus we have
%
\begin{eqnarray} \pi_\theta({\hat {\cal Q}}_{\pm})^u_u=-i{\hat\nu}^{\bold{ir}}_\pm \
, \qquad \pi_\theta({\hat {\cal Q}}_{\pm})^u_d={\sqrt {2M}} e^{\pm\theta/2}\ ,
\qquad \pi_\theta({\hat {\cal Q}}_{\pm})^d_u={\sqrt {2M}} e^{\mp\theta/2} \
,\qquad \pi_\theta({\hat {\cal Q}}_{\pm})^d_d= i{\hat\nu}^{\bold{ir}}_\pm\ \nonumber \end{eqnarray}
%
If we impose $N=2$ boundary supersymmetry in the quantum model, the supercharges (\ref{bsusy}) must commute with the boundary reflection matrix. Then, we are looking for the ``minimal'' solution of the dynamical extension of the intertwining equation considered in \cite{Warn,Nepo2}:
%
\begin{eqnarray} {K_{\bold {susy}}}^\delta_\nu(\theta){\pi_\theta({\hat
{\cal Q}}_{\pm})}^\nu_\zeta={\pi_{-\theta}({\hat
{\cal Q}}_{\pm})}^\delta_\nu{K_{\bold {susy}}}^\nu_\zeta(\theta) \label{inter}\end{eqnarray}
%
where indices \ $\{\delta,\nu,\zeta\}\in\{u,d\}$ \ refer to two-dimensional supermultiplet representation  on
asymptotic soliton states \ $|u(\theta)\rangle$, $|d(\theta)\rangle$. Then,
using this representation the solution $K_{\bold {susy}}(\theta)$ is written as
a $2\times 2$ matrix with entries expressed in terms of the
boundary operators. In the non-dynamical case \cite{GZ,Warn}, the entries are
just analytic functions of $\theta$ as $\nu^{\bold{ir}}_\pm$ are
$c-$numbers. Let us define
%
\begin{eqnarray} {K_{\bold {susy}}}^u_u(\theta)=A(\theta)\ ,\qquad \qquad
{K_{\bold {susy}}}^u_d(\theta)=B(\theta)\ ,\nonumber \\
{K_{\bold {susy}}}^d_u(\theta)=D(\theta)\ ,\qquad \qquad
{K_{\bold {susy}}}^d_d(\theta)=E(\theta)\ .\label{def}\end{eqnarray}
%
After some calculations, we find that the entries of the minimal
solution ${K_{\bold {susy}}}(\theta)$ of the intertwining equation
(\ref{inter}) takes the following form:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
&&A(\theta)=\Big(\ e^{\theta/2}\nu^{\bold{ir}}_+  \ \ +  \ \ e^{-\theta/2}\nu^{\bold{ir}}_-\ \Big)/k{\sqrt 2} \  ,\qquad \
B(\theta)=\Big(\ -i\sinh(\theta)\ \  +  \ \ \frac{i(\alpha+1)}{k^2}\ [\nu^{\bold{ir}}_+,\nu^{\bold{ir}}_-]\ \Big)/2\ ,\nonumber \\

where the boundary operators satisfy 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\{\nu^{\bold{ir}}_\pm,[\nu^{\bold{ir}}_+,\nu^{\bold{ir}}_-]\}=0 \qquad \quad  \mbox{and} \qquad 
\quad [({\nu^{\bold{ir}}_\pm})^2,\nu^{\bold{ir}}_+]=0 \ .\label{condop}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Here $\alpha$ is a real parameter.
One obvious realization is $\nu^{\bold{ir}}_{\pm}\equiv e^{\pm i\xi}$ in which case we recover the Ghoshal-Zamolodchikov-DeVega-Gonzalez-Ruiz minimal solution
\cite{GZ,DeVega}. An other solution to ({\ref{condop}) is to introduce a dimensionless complex fermion at the boundary ${\bold b}(y)$, ${\bold b}^\dagger(y)$ \ such that using (\ref{opcond}), asymptotically it satisfies
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\{{\bold b},{\bold b}\}=\{{\bold b}^\dagger,{\bold b}^\dagger\}=0 \qquad \quad \mbox{and} \qquad \quad \{{\bold b},{\bold b}^\dagger\}=1 \qquad \quad \mbox{with}\qquad {\bold b}(\pm\infty)\equiv {\bold b}\ .\label{fermiondef}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Together with the asymptotics (\ref{opcond}) we choose the representation $\nu^{\bold{ir}}_{\pm}=\sigma_\pm$ in (\ref{entrees}), where $\sigma_\pm$ are Pauli matrices which act on the (pure) boundary space of states. In the Lagrangean (\ref{actionSG}) with (\ref{replace}), it leads to the choice
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\nu^{\bold{uv}}_{+}(y)=  \ {\bold b}(y) \qquad \quad \mbox{and}\qquad \quad \nu^{\bold{uv}}_{-}(y)= \ {\bold b}^\dagger(y)  \ .\label{link} 
\end{eqnarray}
%
We would like to stress that the minimal part (\ref{def}) with (\ref{entrees}) of the boundary reflection matrix associated with the SG model at its $N=2$ supersymmetric point possesses two free parameters \ $\{k,\alpha\}$. In full generality, one may choose to introduce a phase $e^{\pm i\rho}$ in front of $\nu^{\bold{ir}}_{\pm}$ in (\ref{entrees}). However this phase can be removed using a gauge transformation over the fermionic boundary degrees of freedom.

\subsection{Boundary Yang-Baxter equations and boundary reflection matrix}
In the bulk, the perturbed $N=2$ superconformal minimal model (the SG model at $\hat{\beta}^2=4/3$) is massive and integrable. Integrability imposes strong constraints on the system which implies that the $S$-matrix has to satisfy
the quantum Yang-Baxter equations. The entries at $\hat{\beta}^2=4/3$ read for $u=-i\theta$:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
{S_{\bold {susy}}}^{\pm\pm}_{\pm\pm}(\theta)\equiv a(\theta)=\cos(u/2)Z(u)\ , \quad {S_{\bold {susy}}}^{\pm\mp}_{\pm\mp}(\theta)\equiv b(\theta)=\sin(u/2)Z(u)\ , \quad {S_{\bold {susy}}}^{\pm\mp}_{\mp\pm}(\theta)\equiv c(\theta)=Z(u)\  
\end{eqnarray}
%
and vanish otherwize. The factor $Z(u)$ ensures unitarity and crossing symmetry of the $S$-matrix. Its exact expression can be found in \cite{FendleyInt}. 

For boundary integrable field theories, the soliton/antisoliton reflection matrix is constrained by the boundary Yang-Baxter 
equations (the so-called reflection equations). In our case, it reads $R_{\bold {susy}}(\th)$ and obeys
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{qRR} S_{\bold {susy}}(\th-\th'){"
