\begin{abstract}
We introduce a matrix model for noncommutative gravity, based on
the gauge group $U(2) \otimes U(2)$. The vierbein is encoded in a
matrix $Y_{\mu}$, having values in the coset space $U(4)/ (U(2)
\otimes U(2))$, while the spin connection is encoded in a matrix
$X_\mu$, having values in $U(2) \otimes U(2)$. We show how to
recover the Einstein equations from the $\theta \rightarrow 0$
limit of the matrix model equations of motion. We stress the
necessity of a metric tensor, which is a covariant representation
of the gauge group in order to set up a consistent second order
formalism. We finally define noncommutative gravitational
instantons as generated by $U(2) \otimes U(2)$ valued
quasi-unitary operators acting on the background of the Matrix
model. Some of these solutions have naturally self-dual or
anti-self-dual spin connections.
