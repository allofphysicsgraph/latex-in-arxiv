\item{
We find that the chiral symmetry of the theory is not explicit at
finite lattice spacing and is broken by a Wilson term, with
coefficient fixed by the (super-)symmetries of the deconstructed theory.
Thus the chiral symmetry appears only as an accidental symmetry in
the continuum limit. The lattice action is worked out in section
2.1, and the equivalence to the standard Wilson fermion
formulation is shown in section 2.2.}
\item{The anomaly of the chiral $U(1)_R$ symmetry can be understood
using lattice perturbation theory, as in
the classic work of Karsten and Smit \cite{KS81}. A point worth
noticing is that the large value of the Wilson term coefficient
precludes the interpretation of the anomaly as due to heavy
doublers acting as  4d Pauli-Villars regulators in the continuum
limit, yet the correct anomalous Ward identity results. This is
discussed in section 2.2.}
\item{A ``modern"" view on the chiral anomaly in the deconstructed theory
results from considering its fractional brane realization. This brane
realization is explained in sections 3.1, 3.2. In section 3.1,  we also
review how the $U(1)_R$ anomaly  in the continuum Seiberg-Witten
theory is understood from the corresponding classical
supergravity.}
\item{We show, in  section 3.3,  how one can compute the anomaly in the
lattice version of the theory using fractional branes. We also find the
expression for the running coupling and discuss the continuum limit. In
section 3.4, we give a geometric interpretation of the R-symmetry
violating Wilson term.}

\item
The fields $\eta_k$, $\eta_{-k}$ and $\chi_{-k}, \chi_{k}$ in
(\ref{fermion6})  are the left and right moving components of the
two 4d adjoint fermions in the continuum limit, respectively. The
free part of the fermion action respects an $U(2)^N$ symmetry,
with $(\eta_k^a,\chi_{-k}^a)^T$ transforming as a doublet of
$SU(2)_k$  with unit charge   under the corresponding $U(1)_k$.
\item
The fermion bilinear  lagrangian $L_{ferm.}$ preserves, even for
finite $N$,
  a diagonal $SU(2)  \times U(1)  \subset U(2)^N$ symmetry,
with $k$-independent action on the fermions as described in the
previous  paragraph.
Note that, even though the current associated with this diagonal
$U(1)$  has the correct low-energy limit to represent (the 3d part of) a
4d
$U(1)_R$ current, it does not obey the correct anomalous Ward
identity. As will be shown below, there exists a current with the
same $R$ charges for the light states, but with different
$R$-charges for the heavy states, which gives the correct anomaly.
\item
We should stress that  the above diagonal $SU(2) \times U(1)$
symmetry of the fermion bilinear terms  is not a symmetry
of the lagrangian and is broken by the bosonic terms---it is
evident from the definition (\ref{4dfields}) of the 4d scalar adjoint
$\phi$ that one can  not  even consistently define an $U(1)$
action on $\phi$ for finite $N$ (so that  the kinetic terms of
$A_3$ and $q$ are invariant). We thus conclude that the classical
$SU(2) \times U(1)$ R-symmetry of the 4d $N=2$ theory is only
exact in the continuum limit.
\item
As usual in deconstruction, the mass spectrum can be read off
from eqn.~(\ref{fermion6}). For $k \ll N$, it approximates the
Kaluza-Klein spectrum of a   four-dimensional theory compactified
on a circle of radius: \begin{eqnarray} \label{radius} R = {N \over \pi |v|}~.
\end{eqnarray} The value of the lattice spacing is $a = 2/|v|$.

\item
  The tadpole: a disc diagram with one closed-string insertion, and
boundary
  conditions corresponding to the
  source branes.  In the supergravity  action this is
summarized by a source term for the closed-string field. From the
above discussion we see that only the field $\tau_{m=0}$  has a
tadpole. The tadpole in our case is proportional to $k$, the total
number of  branes.\footnote{And not to $k-1$. This comes  from the
contribution of CP factors  to the factorized closed-channel
amplitude: the source's coupling to the tadpole has a factor of
Tr $1 = k$.} We choose to normalize the closed-string fields such
that the tadpole is $\frac{b_0}{ 2 \pi} = \frac{k}{\pi}$, where
$b_0 =2k$ is    the one-loop $\beta$ function coefficient of
$SU(k)$.
  \item
  Closed-string propagator:  since the twisted sector fields are
  allowed to vary only in two directions, this gives a logarithmic
  dependence on the coordinates.\footnote{In our conventions for the
normalization
  of the closed-string field kinetic terms,
   the (2 dimensional) propagator satisfies
  $ \nabla^2 G_2(x,y) = \,  2\pi \delta(x) \delta(y)$.} Using complex
notation for the $X^8, X^9$ plane,
$z \equiv X^8 + i X^9$,
one gets:
    \begin{eqnarray}
\label{source}\Phi(z) =  c + \frac{b_0}{ 2 \pi}\, \log (|z|)  ~,\end{eqnarray}
    where $c$ is an integration constant. $\Phi(z)$ is a NS  sector
    scalar, which we relate to the coupling constant below.
\item The response: a disc diagram with two open-string vertex
operators, and one closed-string vertex operator. This summarizes
the coupling of the probe to the closed-string field. The
interaction of the probe occurs at the location $z=A$, and its
strength can be chosen to be $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ (by normalizing the
open string gauge fields appropriately), therefore the coupling on
the probe is:  \begin{eqnarray} \label{running} \frac{1}{g_{eff}^2}
= \frac{c}{4 \pi}+ \frac{b_0}{8 \pi^2}\log (|A|)~.\end{eqnarray}
This indicates that the integration constant $c$ should be related to the
bare coupling by $\frac{c}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{g_0^2}$.

As an orbifold of a Hanany-Witten setup \cite{Lykken:1997gy}, where
D-branes  are stretched between NS
fivebranes. In the continuum limit (moving asymptotically on the
Higgs branch) the D-branes combine and move away from the orbifold in
one direction along the NS
fivebranes. We will not need this setup below, so
we will not provide any details here.
\item
  As a setup of fractional branes on an orbifold. This is the description
we  adopt as it allows
  for a
perturbative string theory treatment \cite{Leigh:1998hj}.
