22,"\cite {BFF}). This
quantity is weakly conserved. Due to the second N\""{o}ther
theorem, it decomposes into the so called {\it reduced current}
(which vanishes on shell) and the {\it superpotential}
\cite{BFF,JS,Sil,FF,BCJ,GS2}. The superpotential is known to represent
that part of a current which is identically conserved, does not
vanish on shell and which is enough for the computation of
conserved quantities (like charges, masses and so on). In this
case one gets explicitly (see \cite{BFF})
\begin{eqnarray}
J_T^{\mu }(\chi ) &=&2\partial _{\nu }[\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho
} \func{tr}({\bf B}_{\nu }\chi )]+\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }
\func{tr}(\chi (D_{\rho }{\bf B}_{\nu }+\bar{D}_{\rho }{\bf
B}_{\nu }))  \nonumber \\ &=&\partial _{\rho }U_T^{\mu \rho
}+\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }\func{tr}(\chi {\bf F}_{\nu \rho
}-\chi {\bf \bar{F}}_{\nu \rho })
\end{eqnarray}
where the superpotential $U_T^{\mu \rho }=-U_T^{\rho \mu }$ takes
the very simple form
\begin{equation}
U_T^{\mu \rho }(\chi )=2\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }\func{tr}({\bf
B}_{\nu }\chi )
\end{equation}
The above decomposition can be easily justified by using the
identity $(D+{\bar D})\alpha =2(\Omega -\bar{\Omega })$
and by the following formula % computations
\begin{equation}
\func{tr}(D\chi \wedge \alpha )=\func{tr}(D(\chi
\alpha))-\func{tr}(\chi D\alpha )=d\func{tr}(\chi \alpha
)-\func{tr}(\chi D\alpha )
\end{equation}
which holds true since the trace vanishes on commutators.

A similar analysis can be performed for the diffeomorphism
invariance of $L_{T}$. Any vectorfield $\xi =\xi ^{\mu }\partial
_{\mu }$ on $M$ is just an infinitesimal diffeomorphism. Under
diffeomorphisms the gauge potentials ${\bf A}_{\mu }$ and ${\bf
\bar{A}}_{\mu }$ behave (at least locally; see the discussion
below) as 1--forms and $L_{T}$ as a scalar density of weight one.
An infinitesimal diffeomorphism transformation acts on any
(natural) geometric object over $M$ by means of the Lie derivative
${\cal L}_{\xi }$. In particular %Hence
\begin{equation}
\delta _{\xi }{\bf A}_{\mu }\equiv {\cal L}_{\xi }{\bf A}_{\mu }=\xi
^{\alpha }\partial _{\alpha }{\bf A}_{\mu }+{\bf A}_{\alpha }
\partial _{\mu}\xi ^{\alpha },\ \ \ \delta _{\xi }L_{T}\equiv
{\cal L}_{\xi}L_{T}=\partial _{\alpha }(\xi ^{\alpha }L_{T})
\label{eqn:18}\end{equation} and similarly for $\delta _{\xi }{\bf
\bar{A}}_{\mu }\equiv {\cal L}_{\xi }{\bf \bar{A}}_{\mu }$. This
leads to the following expression for the N\""other current
\begin{equation}
J_T^{\mu }(\xi )=\xi ^{\mu }L_{T}+\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }
\func{tr}[{\bf B}_{\nu }\partial _{\alpha }({\bf A}_{\rho }+{\bf
\bar{A}}_{\rho })]\xi^{\alpha }+\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }
\func{tr}[{\bf B}_{\nu }({\bf A}_{\alpha }+{\bf \bar{A}}_{\alpha
})]\partial _{\rho }\xi ^{\alpha } \label{eqn:19}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
U_T^{\mu \rho }(\xi )=\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }\func{tr} [{\bf
B}_{\nu }({\bf A}_{\xi }+{\bf \bar{A}}_{\xi })]  \label{eqn:20}
\end{equation}
for the corresponding superpotential (compare with formulae (31)
and (32) in \cite{BFF}). Here for a simplicity we introduced the
shortcut ${\bf A}_{\xi }\equiv {\bf A}_{\alpha }\xi ^{\alpha }$.

Notice that the expressions (\ref{eqn:19}) and (\ref{eqn:20}) are
not gauge--covariant since they do contain gauge non--covariant
terms such as ${\bf A}_{\xi }$ and ${\bf \bar{A}}_{\xi }$ as well
as terms involving the partial derivatives. A similar situation is
also known in Yang--Mills theory, since the formal Lie derivative
(\ref{eqn:18}) does not fill the matrix degrees of freedom.
Strictly speaking, the group ${\rm Diff}(M)$ of all
diffeomorphisms of $M$ is not valid as a global invariance group
for the theory. The most general symmetry group is the group ${\rm
Aut}_{G}(P)$ which consists of all $G$--invariant bundle
authomorphisms $\Phi :P\rightarrow P$, i.e. the so--called
principal $G$--authomorphisms of $P$. The group ${\rm Gauge}(P)$
of all pure gauge transformations is in a natural way a subgroup
of ${\rm Aut}_{G}(P)$, while ${\rm Diff}(M)$ is not. One has
instead a surjective group homomorphism from ${\rm Aut}_{G}(P)$
onto ${\rm Diff}(M)$. The kernel of this homomorphism is of course
${\rm Gauge}(P)$.  It is clear that an infinitesimal authomorphism
$\phi $ of the principal bundle $P$ is generated by the
corresponding $G$--invariant projectable vectorfield on $P$ and it
can be
represented (at least locally) as a pair $%
\phi =(\xi ,\chi )$ with a vectorfield $\xi $ uniquely defined
\cite{BF} (see also discussion in \cite{GS1}).
Fixing some background principal connection $\omega
_{o}\equiv {\bf a}_{\mu }dx^{\mu }$ on $P$ and choosing $\chi
=-{\bf a}_{\xi }$ we may use the formula
\begin{equation}
\delta _{(\xi ,a)}{\bf A}_{\mu }\equiv {\cal L}_{\xi }{\bf A}_{\mu
} -D_{\mu }{\bf a}_{\xi }=\xi ^{\alpha }{\bf F}_{\mu \alpha }+
D_{\mu }({\bf A}_{\xi }-{\bf a}_{\xi })
\end{equation}
in order to lift the vectorfield $\xi $ on $M$ into the
corresponding $G$--invariant projectable vectorfield on $P$. Such
a lifting is not canonical, being background dependent, but it is
global. Moreover, $\omega _{o}$ is flat if and only if the
corresponding lift is a Lie algebra map. This remark generalizes a
so called {\it improved diffeomorphism} technique presented in
\cite{Jac,BH1,BH2}.

We can conclude this part by saying that the diffeomorphism
invariance of a Yang--Mills type Lagrangian is encoded into the
invariance with respect to the lifted diffeomorphisms, i.e. the
corresponding principal authomorphisms of $P$. In our case, the
total superpotential related to the diffeomorphism invariance of
the Lagrangian (\ref{eqn:T3F-2}) has the form
\begin{equation}
U_{T}^{\mu \rho }(\xi ,{\bf a})=\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }
\func{tr}[{\bf B}_{\nu }({\bf A}_{\xi }+{\bf \bar{A}}_{\xi }-2{\bf
a}_{\xi })]
\end{equation}
which is covariant but depends on the background. Finally,
choosing ${\bf a}={\bf \bar{A}}$ we find
\begin{equation}
U_{T}^{\mu \rho }(\xi ,{\bf \bar{A}})=\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }\func{tr}(%
{\bf B}_{\nu }{\bf B}_{\xi })
\end{equation}
which is fully covariant and background independent, provided
${\bf\bar A}$ is a dynamical connection.
Notice, that for a diagonal solution ${\bf A}={\bf \bar A}$ all
expressions for the superpotential automatically vanish, while the
limit ${\bf \bar A}\rightarrow 0$ reproduces the results
previously given in \cite{BFF}.

Alternatively, let us now assume that the connection
$\bar{\omega}$ is a fixed background (non--dynamical) connection.
Thus $\delta \bar{\omega}=0$ in (\ref{eqn:dQT}). The theory in
this case has only one dynamical field but the class of symmetries
is more restrictive: the gauge transformations have to keep the
background unchanged, i.e. $\delta _{\chi }{\bf \bar{A}}_{\mu
}\equiv \bar{D}_{\mu }\chi =0$. This implies $D_{\mu }\chi =[{\bf
B}_{\mu },\chi ]$ and
\begin{equation}
J_T^{\mu }(\chi )=2\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho } \func{tr}({\bf
B}_{\nu }{\bf B}_{\rho }\chi )\equiv \varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho
}\func{tr}([{\bf B}_{\nu },{\bf B}_{\rho }]\chi )
\end{equation}
This last expression vanishes identically in the case of an
Abelian gauge group.

Recently, the so called {\it mixed Chern-Simons term} based on two
independent $U(1)$--gauge fields, one of electromagnetic origin
and the other statistical, has been successfully applied in
2--dimensional superconductivity (see \cite{AF} and references
quoted therein)\footnote{This comment is due to Ashoke Das.}.

\section{Bi--metric Chern--Simons gravity}

A particularly interesting situation appears when $P$ is the
bundle of linear frames $LM$, so that the group $G$ is the general
linear group $GL(3,{\Bbb R})$. Linear connections on $M$ are
principal connections in $LM$.

In this case $\omega $ is a ${\frak gl}(3,{\Bbb R})$--valued
1--form on the bundle $LM$ representing a linear connection on $M$
and $\Omega $ is its Riemann curvature 2--form. We can use a
coordinate section (gauge) $\{\partial _{\mu }\}$ to write down
$\omega ={\bf \Gamma }_{\mu }dx^{\mu }$ and $\Omega =\frac{1}{2}
{\bf R}_{\mu \nu }dx^{\mu }\wedge dx^{\nu }$, where $%
{\bf \Gamma }_{\mu }\equiv \Gamma _{\beta \mu }^{\alpha }$ and
${\bf R}_{\mu\nu }\equiv R_{\beta \mu \nu }^{\alpha }$ are the
standard local expressions for the connection coefficients and its
Riemann curvature tensor represented now as $3\times 3$ matrices.
Alternatively, we can also use a local (but not necessarily
coordinate) section $\{E_{i}=E_{i}^{\mu }\partial _{\mu }\}$, the
so--called {\it dreibein}. In this case, the matrix indices ${\bf
\Gamma }_{\mu }\equiv \Gamma _{j\mu }^{i}$ and ${\bf R}_{\mu \nu
}\equiv R_{j\mu \nu }^{i}$, so called ``world indices'', are
inherited from the dreibein $\{E_{i}\}$.

The Chern--Simons 3--form (\ref{eqn:CS3F}) lives then on the
bundle of linear frames $LM$ and the (local) Lagrangian
(\ref{eqn:LCSG}) can be obtained from (\ref{eqn:CS3F}) by
pull--back along a coordinate section $\{\partial _{\mu }\} $ of
$LM$. Having chosen a coordinate atlas on the base manifold, with
any coordinate neighborhood one can associate such a local
Lagrangian. On the intersection of two neighborhoods both
Lagrangians differ by a total derivative. This defines a
0--cochain of local Lagrangians in the sense of \v {C}ech
cohomology. Conservation laws for this type of non--global
Lagrangians will be investigated in detail in \cite{BFFP}. If the
manifold $M$ is parallelizable (i.e. $LM$ is a trivial bundle,
what is always the case for a compact, oriented 3--manifold), one
can also use a global (but probably no longer coordinate) dreibein
to obtain a global but not invariant Lagrangian.

Assuming that the linear connection ${\bf \Gamma }$ is the
Levi--Civita connection of some metric $g$ on $M$:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma _{\beta \mu }^{\alpha }=\frac{1}{2}g^{\alpha \sigma }
(\partial_{\beta }g_{\mu \sigma }+\partial _{\mu }g_{\sigma \beta
}-\partial _{\sigma }g_{\beta \mu })
\end{equation}
i.e. considering $g$ instead of ${\bf \Gamma }$ as the dynamical
variable, we thus obtain Chern--Simons gravity theory. The
corresponding action (\ref {eqn:08}) is metric dependent and it
produces the secondary invariant of a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$
(see \cite{CS1,CS2}).

The transgression form (\ref{eqn:T3F-2}) gives then a new global
and bimetric Lagrangian density for a Chern--Simons gravity. The
Lagrangian (\ref{LT}) takes now the form
\begin{eqnarray}
L_{TG}(g,\bar{g}) &=&\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }\func{tr}({\bf
\bar{R}}_{\mu \nu }{\bf N}_{\rho }+(\bar{\nabla}_{\mu }{\bf
N}_{\nu }){\bf N}_{\rho }+\frac{2}{3}{\bf N}_{\mu }{\bf N}_{\nu
}{\bf N}_{\rho })  \nonumber \\
&\equiv &\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }\func{tr}
({\bf R}_{\mu \nu }{\bf \Gamma }_{\rho }-\frac{2}{3}
{\bf \Gamma }_{\mu }{\bf \Gamma }_{\nu }%
{\bf \Gamma }_{\rho }-{\bf \bar{R}}_{\mu \nu }{\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}}_%
{\rho }+\frac{2}{3}{\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}}_{\mu }{\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}}_%
{\nu }{\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}}_{\rho })  \nonumber \\ &&-\partial
_{\mu }\,[\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }\func{tr}( {\bf \Gamma
}_{\nu }{\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}}_{\rho })]  \label{eqn:26}
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\bf N}_{\mu }\equiv {\bf \Gamma }_{\mu }-{\bar{
{\bf \Gamma }}}_{\mu} $ and $\bar{\nabla}_{\mu }\equiv \partial
_{\mu }+[{\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}}%
_{\mu },\,\cdot \,]$ denotes the Levi--Civita covariant derivative
with respect to the metric $\bar{g}$. Again, since the difference
of two connections is a tensorial 1--form $N_{j\mu }^{i}dx^{\mu }$
one plays exclusively with tensorial objects. Therefore, there is
no need to distinguish between the world and the local indices.
Accordingly, the Lagrangian density (\ref{eqn:26}) is a global and
dreibein independent 3--form on $M$. It is even fully covariant
(i.e. natural) if one considers both metrics $(g,\bar{g})$ as
dynamical fields. Now, it is well justified to use the local
expression
\begin{eqnarray}
L_{TG}(g,\bar{g}) &=&\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho
}(\bar{R}_{\beta\mu\nu }^{\alpha }N_{\alpha\rho }^{\beta
}+(\bar{\nabla}_{\mu }N_{\beta \nu }^{\alpha })N_{\alpha \rho
}^{\beta }+\frac{2}{3}N_{\beta \mu }^{\alpha }N_{\sigma \nu
}^{\beta }N_{\alpha \rho }^{\sigma })  \nonumber \\ &\equiv
&\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }(R_{\beta \mu \nu
}^{\alpha }\Gamma _{\alpha \rho }^{\beta }-\frac{2}{3}\Gamma
_{\beta \mu }^{\alpha}\Gamma _{\sigma \nu }^{\beta }\Gamma
_{\alpha \rho }^{\sigma }-\bar{R}_{\beta \mu \nu}^{\alpha
}\bar{\Gamma}_{\alpha\rho }^{\beta }+\frac{2}{3}\bar{\Gamma}_{\beta
\mu }^{\alpha}\bar{\Gamma}_{\sigma \nu }^{\beta }\bar{%
\Gamma}_{\alpha \rho }^{\sigma })  \nonumber \\ &&-\partial _{\mu
}\,[\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}\Gamma_{\beta\nu }^{\alpha
}\bar{\Gamma}_{\alpha \rho }^{\beta }]  \label{eqn:27}
\end{eqnarray}
for the corresponding global 3--form on $M$. Variation of
(\ref{eqn:27}) with respect to the connections $({\bf \Gamma
},{\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}})$ yields (compare with (\ref{eqn:13})):
\begin{equation}
\delta L_{TG}=\varepsilon^{\mu \nu\rho}(R_{\beta\mu \nu}^{\alpha
}\delta \Gamma _{\alpha\rho}^{\beta}-\bar{R}_{\beta\mu\nu
}^{\alpha }\delta\bar{\Gamma}_{\alpha \rho }^{\beta})-\partial
_{\mu}\,[\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}N_{\beta\nu}^{\alpha}(\delta
\Gamma_{\alpha\rho}^{\beta}+\delta\bar{\Gamma}_{\alpha\rho
}^{\beta})]  \label{eqn:28}
\end{equation}

In fact, the Lagrangian (\ref{eqn:27}) and its variation
(\ref{eqn:28}) can be alternatively analyzed from a first-order
(\'{a} la Palatini) point of view, i.e. having just two linear
connections $({\bf \Gamma },{\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}})$ as dynamical
variables \footnote{Of course, the  bi-metric and bi-connection
approaches are not equivalent since they lead to non-equivalent
equations of motion.}. As a symmetry transformation consider then
a 1--parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by the
vectorfield $\xi =\xi ^{\alpha}\partial_{\alpha }$. The Lie
derivative of an arbitrary (non-symmetric) linear connection ${\bf
\Gamma }$ reads (see e.g. \cite{Yano,Sch})
\begin{equation}
\delta _{\xi }{\bf \Gamma }_{\rho }\equiv {\cal L}_{\xi }\Gamma
_{\alpha \rho }^{\beta }=\xi ^{\sigma }R_{\alpha \sigma \rho
}^{\beta }+\nabla _{\rho }\nabla^*_{\alpha }\xi ^{\beta }
\label{yano}
\end{equation}
where $\nabla^*_{\alpha}\xi ^{\beta}=\partial_{\alpha }\xi ^{\beta
}+\Gamma^\beta_{\sigma\alpha}\xi^\sigma$ (remember that
$\nabla_{\alpha}\xi ^{\beta}=\partial_{\alpha }\xi ^{\beta
}+\Gamma^\beta_{\alpha\sigma}\xi^\sigma$). It defines a canonical
natural lift from any vectorfield on $M$ to the corresponding
invariant projectable vectorfield on an appropriate bundle of
geometric objects over $M$. In other words, the difference between
this case and the general one discussed in the previous section is
that the Lie transport provides now a canonical (i.e. background
independent) embedding of ${\rm Diff}(M)$ into the group of
principal authomorphisms of $LM$ with a gauge part represented by
$\chi=\nabla^*\xi$. Applying formula (\ref{eqn:20}) to the present
case one might be tempted to write
\begin{equation}
U_T^{\mu \rho }(\xi )=\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }
N_{\beta\nu}^\alpha (\nabla^*_{\alpha }+\bar{\nabla}^*_{\alpha
})\xi^\beta %\label{eqn:UT20}
\end{equation}
for the corresponding superpotential. This is wrong since
variation (\ref{yano}) is a second order differential operator in
$\xi$ (see \cite{BFF,FF,FF2}).

It is now convenient to assume that both connections are symmetric
(i.e. torsion free) linear connections on $M$. Thus following the
same steps as for computations of formula (60) in \cite{BFF} but
this time in a covariant manner, i.e. having replaced $\Gamma
_{\beta \mu }^{\alpha }$ by $N_{\beta \mu }^{\alpha }$ and the
partial derivatives $\partial _{\mu }$ by the covariant ones
$\nabla _{\mu }$ or $\bar{\nabla}_{\mu }$ respectively one gets
\begin{equation}
U_T^{\mu \rho }(\xi )=
\frac{1}{6}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}[(\nabla
_{\sigma}+\bar{\nabla}_{\sigma})(3N_{\alpha\nu}^{\sigma}
- \delta_{\nu}^{\sigma}N_{\alpha\beta}^{\beta})]\xi^{\alpha} %\nonumber\\
- \frac{1}{3}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}(3N_{\alpha\nu}^{\sigma}
-\delta_{\nu}^{\sigma}N_{\alpha\beta}^{\beta})(\nabla_{\sigma}+
\bar{\nabla}_{\sigma })\xi ^{\alpha }\label{eqn:UT20}
\end{equation}

Coming back to the purely metric formalism we wish to perform the
variation of (\ref{eqn:27}) with respect to the metrics
$(g,\bar{g})$. For this reason one has to replace $\delta {\bf
\Gamma }_{\rho }$ in the first term of (\ref{eqn:28}) by means of
the {\em ``Palatini formula''}
\begin{equation}
\delta \Gamma _{\beta \rho }^{\alpha }=\frac{1}{2}g^{\alpha \sigma }(\nabla
_{\beta }\delta g_{\rho \sigma }+\nabla _{\rho }\delta g_{\sigma \beta
}-\nabla _{\sigma }\delta g_{\beta \rho })
\end{equation}
and the same for $\delta {\bar{{\bf \Gamma }}}_{\rho }$.
Accordingly, after some computation (see also \cite{BFF}) the
bimetric first variational formula reads now as
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta L_{TG} &=&\bar{C}^{\alpha \rho }\delta \bar{g}_{\alpha \rho
}-C^{\alpha \rho }\delta g_{\alpha \rho }+  \nonumber \\
&&\partial _{\mu }[\varepsilon ^{\mu \nu \rho }(2R_{\nu }^{\alpha
}\delta g_{\alpha \rho }-2\bar{R}_{\nu }^{\alpha }\delta
\bar{g}_{\alpha \rho }-N_{\beta \nu }^{\alpha }(\delta \Gamma
_{\alpha \rho }^{\beta }+\delta \bar{\Gamma}_{\alpha \rho }^{\beta
})]  \label{eqn:30}
\end{eqnarray}
where the York--Cotton tensor density $C^{\alpha \rho }$ (resp.
$\bar{C}^ {\alpha\rho }$) is given by (\ref{eqn:Cotton}). The
Euler--Lagrange field equations are $C^{\alpha \rho
}=\bar{C}^{\alpha \rho }=0$. We recall that the York--Cotton
tensor density is symmetric, traceless, divergence--free and it
vanishes if and only if the corresponding metric is conformally
flat.

Again, as a symmetry transformation let us consider  a flow of
diffeomorphisms generated by the vectorfield $\xi =\xi ^{\alpha }
\partial_{\alpha }$. In this case the Lie derivative operators
\begin{equation}
\delta _{\xi }g\equiv {\cal L}_{\xi }g_{\alpha\rho
}=\nabla_{\alpha}\xi _{\rho}+\nabla_{\rho }\xi_{\alpha}
\label{eqn:31}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\delta _{\xi }{\bf \Gamma }_{\rho }\equiv {\cal L}_{\xi }\Gamma
_{\alpha \rho }^{\beta }=\xi ^{\sigma }R_{\alpha \sigma \rho
}^{\beta }+ \nabla _{\rho}\nabla _{\alpha }\xi ^{\beta }
\label{eqn:32}
\end{equation}
represent the infinitesimal variations.

Consequently, the formulae (\ref{eqn:30}), (\ref{eqn:31}) and
(\ref{eqn:32}) allow us to calculate the canonical
energy--momentum complex and superpotential in both covariant
(bi--metric) and background connection ($\delta \bar{\Gamma}\equiv
0$) formalisms. To this end we make use of the computations
already performed in \cite {BFF}. Only terms under the divergence
in (\ref{eqn:30}) will contribute into the superpotential. We see
that the first two terms correspond to the formula (56) in
\cite{BFF}. Therefore, combining with (\ref{eqn:UT20}) we arrive
to the following expression:
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{TG}^{\mu \rho }(\xi)=\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}[(
3R_{\nu\alpha}-Rg_{\nu\alpha}- 3\bar{R}_{\nu\alpha}+\bar{R}
\bar{g}_{\nu\alpha})\xi^{\alpha } + \nonumber\\
\frac{1}{6}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}[(\nabla
_{\sigma}+\bar{\nabla}_{\sigma})(3N_{\alpha\nu}^{\sigma}
- \delta_{\nu}^{\sigma}N_{\alpha\beta}^{\beta})]\xi^{\alpha} %\nonumber\\
- \frac{1}{3}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}(3N_{\alpha\nu}^{\sigma}
-\delta_{\nu}^{\sigma}N_{\alpha\beta}^{\beta})(\nabla_{\sigma}+
\bar{\nabla}_{\sigma })\xi ^{\alpha }&\ &\ \label{eqn:38}
\end{eqnarray}

As a concrete example one can consider a solution $(g, \bar g)$
consisting of a flat metric $\bar g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}$ while
$g_{\mu\nu}=\exp{(2\phi)}\,\eta_{\mu\nu}$ being conformal to
$\eta$ with a conformal factor $\phi$. Having chosen
$\xi^\alpha=\eta^{\alpha\beta}\phi_{,\beta}$ one calculates
\begin{equation}
U = d F + F d \phi
\end{equation}
as a 1--form, where
$F=-\,\eta^{\alpha\beta}\phi_{,\alpha}\phi_{,\beta}$. In
particular, for
$\phi=r\equiv\sqrt{\eta_{\alpha\beta}x^{\alpha}x^{\beta}}$ we
obtain $U=-\,d r$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
U^{\mu\rho}= -\,\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}\ \frac{x_\nu}{r}
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusions}

We have considered the Chern--Simons type models in three
dimensions. Exploiting the Chern--Simons transgression $3$-form
enables us to find a new global Lagrangian density which unlike,
the local Chern-Simons Lagrangian is generally covariant. However,
in this approach the covariant Lagrangian has bi-connection
character and the corresponding theory is getting lost some of its
topological properties. Particulary, the action functional becomes
insensitive for topology of underlaying $3$-manifolds. The
formalism has been used for calculation of conserved N\""other
currents and their identically conserved parts -- superpotentials.
Two special cases are of particular interest: the case of two
connection being dynamical and the case when one of the
connections is given as a fixed background while the only the
other one is dynamical. Finally, the Chern-Simons gravity has been
treated in a similar way. In this sense the present paper
generalizes the results of our previous paper \cite{BFF} obtained
for non-covariant Chern--Simons Lagrangians (see also \cite{GS1}).
Recently, this covariant formalism has been successfully applied
to explicit numerical calculations of conserved quantities for BTZ
black hole solutions in $AdS_3$ Chern--Simons  %({\it \'a la} Witten)
gravity of the Witten type \cite{Ale}.

Chern--Simons type Lagrangians in $d=3$ dimensions are analyzed
from the point of view of their covariance and globality. We use
the transgression formula to find out a new fully covariant and
global Lagrangian for Chern--Simons gravity: the price for
establishing globality is hidden in a bimetric (or biconnection)
structure. Such a formulation  allows to calculate from a global
and simpler viewpoint the energy-momentum complex and the
superpotential both for Yang--Mills and gravitational examples.
