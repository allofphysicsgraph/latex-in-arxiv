Unstable D-branes or brane-antibrane systems can decay to lower-dimensional branes.  In
the effective field theory description, the final state branes are defects in the tachyon
field which describes the initial instability.  We study the dynamical formation of
codimension one defects (kinks) using Sen's ansatz for the tachyon Lagrangian.   It is
shown that the slope of the kink diverges within a finite amount of time after the
tachyon starts to roll.  We discuss the relevance for reheating after brane-antibrane
inflation.
