\end{eqnarray*}
and the 1-forms are changed to
\begin{equation}\label{transO}
 \alpha'_I=\alpha_I+\CX^*\beta_I\,.
\end{equation}
 As shown above, $\CX^*\beta_I$ is closed so that the new $\alpha'_I$
still define elements of the first cohomology. However, the
$\CX^*\beta_I$ need not be exact and so also a redefinition of $\wtO$
may change the cohomology classes characterising a given connection
(not just the representatives of the original classes).

This implies that there is no {\em canonical\/} isomorphism between
gauge equivalence classes of $A$-fields for fixed $\CX$ with the set
of $k$ elements in $H^1(\S)$, while still any particular choice of
$\widetilde \O$ and $C^I$ does define an isomorphism. The situation is
comparable to that in non-abelian gauge theories where a map between
gauge equivalence classes of gauge fields and elements of $\pi^1(\S)$
is defined only upon choosing closed curves which generate $\pi^1(\S)$.

\subsubsection{Generalizations}
\label{sec:Gen}

So far we assumed that the leaf $L$ has trivial holonomy, implying
that there is a global set of Casimir functions $C^I$ such that
$L=(C^I)^{-1}(0)$. In other words, the conormal bundle
$(NL)^*=\bigcup_{X\in L}\{\alpha\in T_X^*M: \alpha(v)=0\mbox{ for all
}v\in T_XL\}$ of $L$ is a trivial vector bundle with global basis
$\{\mathrm{d} C^I\}_{I=1\ldots k}$. As seen in Prop.\ \ref{sol2}, for a fixed
leaf $L$ solutions $A$ to the Poisson Sigma Model are then given in
terms of closed 1-forms $\alpha=\alpha_I \, \bard C^I$ on $\Sigma$,
taking values in the pull back of the conormal bundle of $L$.  Here we
denoted the basis in the pull back bundle which corresponds to $\mathrm{d}
C^I$ by $\bard C^I$; it is not to be confused with the pull back of
$\mathrm{d} C^I$, which would be identically zero (and also a section in a
different bundle). The respective contribution to (\ref{solu}) then
can be understood in the following way: Take $\alpha$ as a section in
$T^*\S \otimes \CX^* (NL)^*$, i.e.~$\a \in
\O^1(\S,\CX^* (NL)^*)$. $\CX^* (NL)^*$ is embedded canonically into
$\CX^* T^*M$, we thus may view $\alpha$ also as a particular section
through that bundle. Then we can contract $\alpha$ with $\partial_i$,
viewed as a basis in $\CX^* TM$. Thus the second part of (\ref{solu})
can be written as $\langle \partial_i , \alpha \rangle$. Up to gauge
transformations, only equivalence classes $[\alpha]\in
H^1(\Sigma,\CX^*(NL)^*)$ are representatives. This will be made more
precise in the more general setting to follow.

If the leaf $L$ has non-trivial holonomy, its conormal bundle is
non-trivial and (\ref{solu}) cannot be used as a global
expression. Instead, we have to choose a covering of the leaf such
that in any neighborhood $\CU_i$ of the covering there exist Casimir
functions $C^I_{(i)}$ specifying $L\cap\CU_i=(C^I_{(i)})^{-1}(0)$. If
two neighborhoods have non-empty intersection, there are different
sets of Casimir functions which are related by a transformation
$C^I_{(i)}=f_{(ij)}{}^I_J(C_{(j)})C^J_{(j)}$ as discussed in the
previous subsection. 

\smallskip

\noindent{\it Example:\/} Let $M=[-1,1]^3/\sim$ where the
identifacation $\sim$ is defined by $(1,y,z)\sim (-1,-y,z)$ for all
$y,z\in [-1,1]$, equipped with the Poisson tensor
$\CP=\partial_x\wedge\partial_z$ admitting the compatible
presymplectic form $\wtO=\mathrm{d} x\wedge\mathrm{d} z$. Any section
$z=\mbox{const}$ is a M\""obius strip. The set $L\colon y=0$ is a leaf
in $(M,\CP)$ (while a set $y=\mbox{const}\not=0$ is only half of a
leaf) which can be covered by two neighborhoods ${\cal U}_{1,2}$
admitting the local Casimir function $C=y$. On the full leaf, however,
$y$ is not a global Casimir function since values $y=c$ and $y=-c$
belong to the same leaf for any constant $c\in [-1,1]\backslash
\{0\}$. Correspondingly, we have non-trivial transition functions
$f_1=1$ and $f_2=-1$ in the two intersections of the neighborhoods.

\smallskip

In any neighborhood, (\ref{solu}) is the local expression of a
solution with $(\alpha_I\, \bard C^I)_{(i)}$ representing the solution
as local section of the conormal bundle (plus the cotangent bundle of
$\Sigma$ certainly). The transformation between
different charts is done via (\ref{transC}) such that
$(\alpha_I'\, \bard C^{\prime I})_{(i)}=(\alpha_I\,\bard C^I)_{(j)}$
in ${\cal U}_i\cap{\cal U}_j$. As a global object, therefore, the
local sections $(\alpha_I\,\bard C^I)_{(i)}$ form again a 1-form
$\alpha$ on $\Sigma$ taking values in the pull back of the conormal
bundle of $L$. 

Every local section has to be closed according to the field equations,
and they combine to a global 1-form which is closed in the following
sense: The transition functions of a non-trivial conormal bundle are
given by the {\em constants\/} $f_{(ij)}{}^I_J$, implying that the
conormal bundle is a flat vector bundle\footnote{We are grateful to
A.~Kotov for pointing this out to us.} with a canonical derivative
operator $D$. To be more explicit, one may define an
operator $D$ which annihilates any local basis $(\bard C^I)_{(i)}$;
this derivative is then extended to forms on $\S$ with values in
$\CX^*(NL)^*$ by the graded Leibniz rule: For
$\b \in \Omega^p(\S,\CX^*(NL)^*)$ locally we have 
$\b=(\b_I \bard C^I)_{(i)}$ and then simply $D \b = (\mathrm{d} \b_I \bard
C^I)_{(i)}$.  The locally
$\mathrm{d}$-closed 1-forms $(\alpha_I\, \bard C^I)_{(i)}$ combine to a
globally $D$-closed section $\alpha \in \O^1(\S,\CX^*(NL)^*)$, 
which represents a solution to the field equations. Clearly, $D^2 = 0$
(since the connection is flat, by construction) and there is a natural
cohomology defined on  $\O^p(\S,\CX^*(NL)^*)$, denoted by
$H^p(\S,\CX^*(NL)^*)$. 

To find unique
representatives, we have to consider the symmetry
transformations. As before, the local expressions $(\alpha_I\, \bard
C^I)_{(i)}$ can be changed by adding an exact local 1-form
$(\mathrm{d}\epsilon_I\bard C^I)_{(i)}$. Again, the local 1-forms combine
to a $D$-exact 1-form $D(\epsilon_I\bard C^I)$ taking values in the
pulled back conormal bundle. Thus, solutions are classified by the
first $D$-cohomology $H^1(\Sigma,\CX^*(NL)^*)$.

A similar strategy can be used to deal with leaves which do not admit
a compatible presymplectic form: those leaves can be cut into parts
each admitting a compatible presymplectic form which have to be glued
together by the transformation of the preceding subsection. This will
then imply a transformation (\ref{transO}) for the $\alpha_I$ on
overlapping charts. Returning back to already existing charts then
leads to restrictions on the permitted $\alpha$s. This may lead also
to compactifcations in the solution space, which in previous cases was
always non-compact while it would be compact for, e.g., 2d
$BF$-theories with compact gauge groups. In the present paper,
however, we do not intend to work this out in more detail. 

\subsubsection{Almost topological models}
\label{sec:lsgalmost}

Adding a term \re{nontop}) to the action changes the field equation
for $A$, so we will also obtain different solutions. However, the
changes are not too drastic. To show this we consider the slightly
more general case of an additional term \be
\label{nontopsum}
\int_{\S}C^\s(X(x))\, \varepsilon_\s \ee where a sum of such terms
with possibly different Casimir functions $C^\s$ appears. The
contribution of this addition to the field equations has been
determined in (\ref{eqsnontop}). Using a set of $k$ functionally
independent Casimir functions $C^I$, all the $C^\s$ can be expressed
in terms of these functions (at least locally). Then $C^\s,_i =
C^\s,_I \, C^I,_i$; introducing $\varepsilon_I := \varepsilon_\s
C^\s,_I$ (a 2-form with values in the conormal bundle; we will make
use of this observation below), using \re{eqsnontop}), the key
equation \re{dA}) in the preceding proof is changed to
\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d}(A_{\underline{i}}+
 \CX^\ast(\partial_{\underline{i}}\lrcorner\wtO))= -\varepsilon_I
 \CX^*(\partial_{\underline{i}} C^I)
\end{equation}
while Eq.\ \re{Aalpha}) still holds true due to
$\partial_{\alpha}C^I=0$. Let us first assume that $\varepsilon_\s =
\mathrm{d} p_\s$  (if some $\epsilon$ are taken to be
a volume form as in Yang--Mills theories, this can be the case only if
$\Sigma$ is non-compact); then also $\varepsilon_I=\mathrm{d} p_I$ is exact
(since $C^\s,_I$ in $p_I = p_\s C^\s,_I$ is, as a function of
Casimirs, constant on $\S$). With the assumption,
any solution $A$ can still be cast into the form \re{solu}), but now
the $\alpha_I$ are not necessarily closed but only $\alpha_I+p_I$ (by
assumption not all $p_I$ can be closed, since otherwise all
$\varepsilon_I=\mathrm{d} p_I$ would vanish). Noting that the symmetries are
unaltered, we obtain

\begin{cor}
  For a given map $\CX$ with image in a symplectic leaf $L$ of trivial
  holonomy which has a neighborhood $U$ permitting a presymplectic
  form $\widetilde \O$ compatible with $\CP$, any solution to the
  field equations \re{eqs1}), \re{eqsnontop}) with $\varepsilon_I=\mathrm{d}
  p_I$ may be written in the form \re{solu}) where $C^I$,
  $I=1,\ldots,k$, are some Casimir functions with $L = (C^I)^{-1}(0)$.
  The 1-forms $\alpha_I+p_I$ are closed on $\S$. For fixed $\widetilde
  \O$ and $C^I$, redefining $\a_I$ by adding an exact 1-form on $\S$
  is a gauge transformation. For a fixed map $\CX$, gauge equivalence
  classes of solutions to the field equations for $A$ correspond to
  the set of $k$ elements $[\a_I+p_I] \in H^1(\S)$.
\end{cor}

If an $\varepsilon_I$ is not exact, we have to proceed more
carefully. For an exact $\varepsilon_I=\mathrm{d} p_I$ we have just seen that
the $\alpha_I$ have to fulfill $\mathrm{d} \alpha_I=-\mathrm{d}
p_I=-\varepsilon_I$. Locally, this will still hold for a non-exact
$\varepsilon_I$ as a consequence of the field equations, but there will be
no 1-forms $\alpha_I$ which can fulfill this equation globally.

For simplicity we first discuss the case $k=1$, i.e.~that there is only
one $\alpha$ which locally fulfills $\mathrm{d}\alpha=\epsilon$. If we choose
a good cover $\{\CU_m\}$ of $\Sigma$ (the neighborhoods $\CU_m$ as
well as their nonvanishing intersections are topologically trivial),
then in each $\CU_m$ we have a 1-form $p_m$ such that $\mathrm{d}
p_m=\epsilon$. Furthermore, due to $\mathrm{d}(p_m-p_n)=\epsilon-\epsilon=0$,
we have functions $\l_{mn}$ with $p_m-p_n=\mathrm{d} \l_{mn}$ on $\CU_m \cap
\CU_n$. Now, $\alpha$ has to fulfill $\mathrm{d}\alpha_m=\epsilon=\mathrm{d} p_m$
which implies $\alpha_m=p_m+\mathrm{d} \l_m$ for some functions $\l_m$ which
can be chosen to be zero by redefinition of $p_m$ or by
using an appropriate local gauge
transformation. In the intersection of two neighborhoods $\CU_m$ and
$\CU_n$,
the local 1-forms of $\alpha$ do not necessarily agree but differ by
an exact form: $\alpha_m-\alpha_n=\mathrm{d} \l_{mn}$. In other words,
$\alpha$ is a connection on the line bundle with curvature $\epsilon$
which is obtained as the pull back of the conormal bundle of the leaf
$L$. As usually, we have $(\alpha-\alpha')_m-(\alpha-\alpha')_n=0$
such that the difference of two such connections $\alpha$ and
$\alpha'$ is a global 1-form. It has to fulfill
$\mathrm{d}(\alpha-\alpha')=0$, i.e., it is closed. Therefore, the space of
all connections of curvature $\epsilon$ can be identified with the
space of closed 1-forms, and the space of gauge equivalence classes
with the first cohomology $H^1(\Sigma)$.

If $k>1$, we obtain the $\alpha_I$ as $k$ connections on $k$ line
bundles the $I$-th one of which has curvature
$\varepsilon_I$. Alternatively, the $\alpha_I$ together can be viewed
as components of an $\mathfrak{a}$-connection on the pull back of the conormal
bundle of the leaf $L$, where $\mathfrak{a}$ is the transversal Lie algebra of
the leaf. In fact, the part $\alpha:=\alpha_IC^I{},_{i}\bard X^i$ of
(\ref{solu}), $\bard X^i$ denoting a basis in $\CX^*T_X^*M$, in a
point $X\in L$ always takes values in the transversal Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{a}_X$ which, as a manifold, can be identified with the conormal
space $(N_XL)^*$.  Furthermore, the transversal Lie algebra of a
regular leaf is always abelian and, therefore, isomorphic to $\dR^k$
with $k={\rm codim}(L,M)$ which coincides with our result of $k$
abelian connections on $k$ line bundles. For a regular leaf the
reformulation via the transversal Lie algebra is thus almost trivial,
but we will see later that it is helpful for a possible generalization
to non-regular leaves.

Finally, gauge transformations of the Poisson Sigma Model have already
been seen to add   exact 1-forms to $\alpha_I$,
which agrees with the notion of gauge transformation for a
connection. Together with the known classification of inequivalent
bundles with connection we obtain

\begin{prop}\label{solnontop2}
  For a given map $\CX$ with image in a symplectic leaf $L$ of trivial
  holonomy which has a neighborhood $U$ permitting a presymplectic
  form $\widetilde \O$ compatible with $\CP$, any solution to the
  field equations \re{eqs1}), \re{eqsnontop}) may be written in the
  form \re{solu}) where $C^I$, $I=1,\ldots,k$, are some Casimir
  functions with $L = (C^I)^{-1}(0)$.

  The $\alpha_I$ form a transversal Lie algebra valued connection on
  the pull back of the conormal bundle of $L$ to $\Sigma$ with
  curvature $\varepsilon_I$. For a fixed map $\CX$, gauge equivalence
  classes of solutions to the field equations for $A$ correspond to
  inequivalent connections of the given curvature on the given line
  bundle on $\Sigma$. All those connections are classified by $k$
  elements of $H^1(\S)$.
\end{prop}

This agrees with the previous results in the case of vanishing or
exact $\varepsilon_I$, in which case the bundles with connection over
$\Sigma$ are trivial. If $L$ has non-trivial holonomy, we can combine
Prop.\ \ref{solnontop2} with the result of the previous subsection. On
each chart $\CU_m$ there is a 1-form $\alpha_m$ with values in the
pull back of the conormal bundle (restricted to the chart). Globally
there is some 2-form $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_I \bard C^I$, taking
values in $\CX^* (NL)^*$, furthermore; on local charts $\{\CU_m\}$, it
has primitives $p_m$, i.e.~$\varepsilon = D p_m$.  Similarly to before
we find $D \a_m = D p_m$, concluding $\a_m = p_m + D \l_m$. With
$\l_{mn} = p_m - p_n$ we then obtain on intersections \be \a_n = \a_m
+ D\left(\l_{mn} +\l_m - \l_n \right) \, , \ee where $\l_m$ reflects
the ambiguity in the definition of the local primitives $p_m$ or
likewise the local gauge freedom.  This defines a kind of connection
on the conormal bundle with ``curvature'' $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_I
\bard C^I$ (on each chart we have $\varepsilon_m \equiv
\varepsilon|_{\CU_m} = D \a_m$). It would be interesting to clarify
the precise mathematical nature of such an object $\{ \a_m \}$.  Since
the $\l_m$ can be gauged to zero and the $\l_{mn}$ are fixed by the
2-forms $\varepsilon_I$ (up to the previously mentioned ambiguity
given by $\l_m$), the \emph{difference} between two such collections
$\{ \a_m \}$ again defines a global 1-form with values in $\CX^*
(NL)^*$. Thus the space of all inequivalent $\alpha$ of the given
``curvature'' $\varepsilon$ is classified by the first cohomology of
conormal bundle valued forms.

Despite the fact that the addition of \re{nontop}) spoils the
topological nature of the model, Corollary \ref{solnontop1} and
Proposition \ref{solnontop2} show that the moduli space of classical
solutions is parameterized by the same topological objects which
classify solutions of the topological models.

\subsubsection{Summary}

Let us summarize the results of this section in

\begin{theo}\label{Summ}
 Let $\Sigma$ be a two-dimensional manifold and $(M,\CP)$ a Poisson
 manifold.

 For stationary points of a topological or almost topological Poisson
 Sigma Model with $\Sigma$ and $(M,\CP)$ the image of the map
 $\CX\colon\Sigma\to M$ is contained in a symplectic leaf $L$ of
 $M$. If $L$ admits a compatible presymplectic form, the space of
 corresponding solutions for $A$ is given by the first cohomology
 class $H^1(\Sigma,\CX^*(NL)^*)$ of forms on $\Sigma$ taking values in the
 pull back via $\CX$ of the conormal bundle of the leaf $L$.  A local
 representation of $A$-solutions is given by (\ref{solu}).
\end{theo}


We already remarked on a possible generalization to cases where a
compatible presymplectic form does not exist globally
(Sec.~\ref{sec:Gen}). Later we will in particular discuss the case of
non-regular leaves.

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:ex}

Applying Theorem \ref{Summ}, we see that in all cases where all leaves
have the same codimension $k$ the solution space ${\CM}_{\mathrm{cl}}(\S)$ is of
dimension
\[ 
 \dim{\CM}_{\mathrm{cl}}(\S)=k\left(\mathop{\mathrm{rank}} H^1(\S)+1\right)
\] 
which generalizes formula (\ref{dimM}) for the dimension in the
topologically trivial case. However, in the general case the solution
space will not be a linear space because there may be non-trivial
identifications, which depend on the topology of $\S$ and the leaf $L$
and can even lead to a non-Hausdorff topology by gluing the sectors
corresponding to different homotopy classes of maps $\CX\colon\S\to
L$. Specializing Theorem \ref{Summ} to the topologically trivial case
dealt with in Sec.\ \ref{Trivial} shows that we get back the explicit
solutions given there. But Theorem \ref{Summ} is applicable to a class
of Poisson Sigma Models more general by far.  E.g.\ if $M$ is foliated
trivially but by topologically non-trivial leaves provided only their
second cohomology vanishes, all solutions are given by Theorem
\ref{Summ} owing to Lemma \ref{pot}.

We can also compare with the results obtained in Sec.\ \ref{NonAbSol}
for non-abelian $BF$-theories. In this case $M$ is the Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}$ of a semisimple Lie group $G$ equipped with the Poisson tensor
$\CP^{ij}=f^{ij}\mbox{}_kX^k$ and the symplectic leaves are identical
to the adjoint orbits in $\mathfrak{g}$ (we identify the Lie algebra of a
semisimple Lie group with its dual by means of the Cartan--Killing
metric).  As compared to Sec.\ \ref{NonAbSol}, we are now solving the
field equations in the opposite direction, i.e.\ we first solve for
$X$. According to Theorem \ref{sol1}, all equivalence classes of
solutions are given by homotopy classes of maps $\CX\colon\S\to L$ for
any leaf $L$. This is identical to the results found in Sec.\
\ref{NonAbSol}. Now, given a solution $X$, solutions for $A$ are given
by Theorem \ref{Summ} in those cases in which a compatible
presymplectic form exists. This can be the case only for non-compact
$G$: for compact $G$ all leaves in $M$ are compact symplectic
manifolds which necessarily have non-trivial second homology, for
otherwise their symplectic form would be exact and so the symplectic
volume would vanish. Now appealing to Corollary \ref{triv} shows that
there is no compatible presymplectic form in any neighborhood of a
given regular leaf because the symplectic volume of any non-trivial
two-cycle is not constant along the direction $\partial_C$ given by
the Casimir function $C(X)=\mathop{\mathrm{tr}}(X^2)$.  Recall that for compact $G$ the
solution space, i.e.\ the space of flat connections, is compact, which
also demonstrates that in this case our methods cannot be applicable
(Theorem \ref{Summ} always implies a non-compact solution space). As
discussed at the end of Sec.~\ref{sec:Gen}, solutions for leaves which
do not admit a global presymplectic form can be found by gluing
solutions obtained with local forms. The gluing procedure will lead to
additional identifications which can compactify the solution space.

If there is a compatible presymplectic form for a non-compact group
$G$ (if, e.g., all leaves have trivial second cohomology, cf.\ Lemma
\ref{pot}), we can apply Theorems \ref{sol1} and \ref{Summ} in order
to find solutions. Solutions for $X$ are given by maps $\CX\colon\S\to
M$ with image contained in an adjoint orbit which coincides with the
observations in Sec.\ \ref{NonAbSol}. However, general results about
the existence of compatible presymplectic forms are available only for
a non-degenerate leaf such that Theorem
\ref{Summ} can directly only lead to solutions with reducible
connections for a semisimple group $G$. In fact, in simple cases one
can show easily that a connection of the form (\ref{solu}) is
reducible: If $\mathop{\mathrm{rank}} G=1$ the Casimir function is $C=\mathop{\mathrm{tr}}(X^2)$,
denoting the Cartan--Killing norm on $\mathfrak{g}$ by $\mathop{\mathrm{tr}}$, and (\ref{solu})
takes the form (using generators $T^i$ of $G$)
\[ A_iT^i=-T^i\CX^*(\partial_i\lrcorner\wtO)+2\alpha X
\] with a closed 1-form $\alpha$ on $\S$. If $\CX$ can be gauged to be
a constant map, the first term vanishes leading to $A=2\alpha X$. This
implies that all holonomies of $A$ are given by $\exp cX$ for some
$c\in\dR$ which shows that $A$ is reducible. We can, therefore, expect
to have access to the generic part of the solution space only if
$\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}\pi_1(\S)$ is small (see, however, possible generalizations
discussed in the next section). Otherwise, the
solution space would be dominated by irreducible connections which
lead to $X$-solutions in the degenerate leaf given by the origin. For
$\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}\pi_1(\S)\leq1$, which physically is most interesting, Theorem
\ref{sol2} determines the generic part of ${\CM}_{\mathrm{cl}}(\S)$ because there are
no irreducible connections. In fact, the dimensions of the solution
spaces given in Sec.\ \ref{NonAbSol} and Theorem \ref{Summ} coincide:
in both cases we need $k=\dim\mathop{\mathrm{ker}}\CP$ parameters to specify a leaf,
which in turn determines the equivalence class of an $X$-solution (up
to certain discrete labels which we need in order to fix the homotopy
class of the map $\CX$), and $k\mathop{\mathrm{rank}} H^1(\S)$ parameters to specify
the $A$-solution. Note that $k=\dim\mathop{\mathrm{ker}}\CP=\dim G/{\rm Ad}$ so that
the dimensions of the space of reducible flat connections and of the
solution space according to Theorem \ref{Summ} in fact coincide.

Noting that, as already remarked in Sec.\ \ref{NonAbSol}, $X$-solutions
lying in regular leaves correspond to reducible connections whose
holonomies generate a maximal {\em abelian\/} subgroup of $G$, we can
clarify the appearance of $H^1(\S)$ in the Poisson Sigma Model
classification of $A$-solutions as opposed to $\pi_1(\S)$ in the gauge
theory classification: Since all holonomies commute, only the
abelianization of $\pi_1(\S)$ matters, which is just $H^1(\S)$.

Corollary \ref{solnontop1} and Proposition \ref{solnontop2} in
particular provide solutions for Yang--Mills theories when we choose a
quadratic Casimir $C$ and volume form $\epsilon$. Proposition
\ref{solnontop2} only applies if the $X$-solution maps $\Sigma$ into a
non-degenerate leaf, so that we obtain solutions with non-vanishing
electric field $X$ leading to a non-flat connection. The difference
between $BF$- and Yang--Mills theories is automatically accounted for
by the appearance of $\epsilon$ in the conditions for a solution $A$.

\section{Non-regular leaves}
\label{sec:nonregular}

Since we are not aware of general results concerning the existence of
compatible presymplectic forms for non-regular leaves, Theorem
\ref{Summ} does not give us direct access to solutions in this
case. The comparison with non-abelian $BF$-theories shows that in
general we cannot expect non-regular leaves to contribute only a
lower-dimensional set to ${\CM}_{\mathrm{cl}}(\S)$; in fact those leaves usually
correspond to solutions forming a dense subset of the moduli
space. Only if the rank of the fundamental group of $\S$ does not
exceed one is the moduli space dominated by solutions corresponding to
non-degenerate leaves. As we will see below, this holds true also for
non-linear Poisson structures.

But the information we obtain is of interest also in cases where
solutions for regular leaves do not correspond to the generic part of
${\CM}_{\mathrm{cl}}(\S)$ in a given model and complements methods which are targeted
to the generic part (e.g.\ the theory of irreducible flat connections
on compact Riemann surfaces used in two-dimensional non-abelian gauge
theories).

The case of gravitational models is special because we have an
additional condition which requires the metric constructed from $A$ to
be non-degenerate. Investigations with other methods
\cite{TK3,TKkinks} suggest that this reduces the contributions from
non-regular leaves such that the methods developed here can have access to
the main part of the moduli space.  In the present paper, however, we
will not dicuss this issue further and instead focus on a possible
generalization of the classification of solutions to non-regular
leaves. 

When discussing the solutions for almost topological Poisson Sigma
Models we already observed that the connection has to be transversal
Lie algebra valued, which in the case of regular leaves is always an
abelian algebra.  To generalize this result we first recall how the
transversal Lie algebra of a point $X\in L$ of a leaf $L$ can be
constructed \cite{SilvaWeinstein}:

\begin{defi}
 The {\em transversal Lie algebra\/}
 of a point $X$ in a leaf $L$ of a
 Poisson manifold $(M,\CP)$ is the conormal space
 $\mathfrak{a}_X:=(NL_X)^*=(T_XM/T_XL)^*\equiv (T_XL)^0=\{\alpha\in
 T^*_XM:\alpha(v)=0 \mbox{ for all }v\in T_XL\}$, identified with the
 annihilator of the tangent space $T_XL$, with the following Lie
 bracket: For two elements $\alpha,\beta\in\mathfrak{a}_X$ we choose functions
 $f$ and $g$ which vanish in a neighborhood of $X$ in the leaf $L$
 such that $\mathrm{d} f_X=\alpha$ and $\mathrm{d} g_X=\beta$. The bracket
\begin{equation}
 [\alpha,\beta]_X:=\mathrm{d}\{f,g\}_X
\end{equation}
 is then well defined and defines the transversal Lie algebra $\mathfrak{a}_X$.
\end{defi}

We will later use another way to identify $\mathfrak{a}_X$ as a submanifold of
the cotangent bundle of $M$:

\begin{lemma} \label{PoissKern}
 As a manifold, the transversal Lie algebra $\mathfrak{a}_X$ is the kernel of
 the Poisson tensor $\CP$ in $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 For any cotangent vector $\omega\in T^*_XM$ the vector
 $v:=\CP^{\#}(\omega)$ is tangential to $L$ such that
 $\CP(\alpha,\omega)=\alpha(v)=0$ for all $\omega\in T_X^*M$ proving
 that $\mathfrak{a}_X$ is contained in the kernel of $\CP$. Equality of the
 vector spaces then follows from a dimensional argument.
\end{proof}

We are going to discuss the transversal Lie algebra for gauge theories
where $M=\mathfrak{g}^*$ as in Sec.~\ref{NonAb}.

\begin{lemma} \label{TransLieDual}
 If $M=\mathfrak{g}^*$ is the dual of a Lie algebra, then the transversal
 Lie algebra $\mathfrak{a}_X$ of a point $X\in M$ is the isotropy algebra of the
 co-adjoint action of $\mathfrak{g}$ at $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 As a subspace of the cotangent bundle of $\mathfrak{g}^*$, $\mathfrak{a}_X$ is
 naturally identified with a subspace of
 $\mathfrak{g}^{**}\equiv\mathfrak{g}$. Furthermore, it follows from the definition
 that $\mathfrak{a}_X$ is also a subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$: if $\alpha=\mathrm{d}
 f_X=f,_{i}\mathrm{d} X^i$ and $\beta=\mathrm{d} g_X=g,_{i}\mathrm{d} X^i$ are in the
 kernel of $\CP_X^{\sharp}$, we have
\[
 \mathrm{d} \{f,g\}=\mathrm{d} (f^{ij}{}_{k}X^kf,_{i}g,_{j})=
 f^{ij}{}_kf,_{i}g,_{j}\mathrm{d} X^k
\]
 which implies
\[
 [\alpha,\beta]_X=\mathrm{d}\{f,g\}=f^{ij}{}_k \alpha_i\beta_j\mathrm{d} X^k\equiv
 [\alpha,\beta]_{\mathfrak{g}}
\]
 where the last bracket denotes the usual bracket in the Lie algebra
 $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathrm{d} X^k$ are identified with the generators of
 $\mathfrak{g}^{**}\equiv\mathfrak{g}$.

 The condition for $\mathfrak{a}_X$ of Lemma \ref{PoissKern} now reads
\[
 \CP_X(\alpha,\omega)=X([\alpha,\omega]_{\mathfrak{g}})=({\rm
 coad}_{\alpha}X)(\omega)=0
\]
 for all $\omega\in\mathfrak{g}$ which concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

If $\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple, we can identify $M=\mathfrak{g}^*$ with $\mathfrak{g}$ and
the point $X\in M$ with an element of $\mathfrak{g}$. The transversal Lie
algebra $\mathfrak{a}_X$ then is the subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ fulfilling
$[X,\alpha]=0$ for all $\alpha\in\mathfrak{a}_X$.

We are now ready to exploit this information in the context of
solutions to gauge theories. We already know that solutions for the
field $X$ are given by arbitrary maps of $\S$ into a leaf $L$ of
$M$. Locally, the map ${\cal X}$ can be deformed by gauge
transformations such that its image is a single point $X\in L$;
therefore, the field equation $\mathrm{d} X+[A,X]=0$ implies that all
solutions for $A$ have to commute with $X\in\mathfrak{g}$ and thus, according
to Lemma \ref{TransLieDual}, have values in the transversal Lie
algebra of $X$. Furthermore, the local component 1-forms $A_i$ such
that $A=A_i\mathrm{d} X^i$ of all those connections can be written as
$\alpha_IC^I{},_{i}$ with $k$ 1-forms $\alpha_I$ where $k$ is the
codimension of the leaf and $C^I$ are $k$ Casimir functions specifying
the leaf. If the image of $X$ is not just a single point, we need an
additional contribution $a$
for the connection such that $[a,X]=-\mathrm{d} X$. Then,
$A:=a+\alpha_IC^I{},_{i}T^i$ would provide a solution to $\mathrm{d}
X+[A,X]=0$. If we can find such a form $a$, any solution to the
first field equation can be written as $a$ plus a transversal Lie
algebra valued connection. This demonstrates that the role of the
transversal Lie algebra is unchanged if we have a non-regular
leaf. Now it is easy to see that $a=-\partial_i\lrcorner\wtO T^i$
with $\wtO$ compatible with $\CP$ is appropriate because
\[
 [\partial_i\lrcorner \wtO T^i,X]=f^{ij}{}_k\wtO_{il}\mathrm{d} X^l X_j
 T^k= \mathrm{d} X^k T_k
\]
provided that $f^{ij}{}_kX_j\wtO_{i\alpha}= -\CP^{ik}\wtO_{i\alpha}=
\delta^k_{\alpha}$ (where $\alpha$ can be regarded as a tangential
index since it is contracted with $\mathrm{d} X^l$). Note that for this
equation $\wtO$ only needs to give the leaf symplectic structure when
restricted to the leaf itself which is weaker than the condition for a
compatible presymplectic form. However, one also has to assure that
$a$ has the correct curvature in order for $A$ to solve the second
field equation. For regular leaves this requires $a$ to be
constructed with a compatible presymplectic form as we have seen.

The last calculations suggest that the classification of solutions to
Poisson Sigma Models as found in this paper generalizes to arbitrary
leaves where the transversal Lie algebra plays the role of the
connection 1-forms $\alpha_I$. (This is also suggested by a
reinterpretation of the solutions as Lie algebroid morphisms
\cite{bks}.) Only the explicit form
(\ref{solu}) of a solution cannot be used if there is no substitute
for the compatible presymplectic form $\wtO$. One example where one
can easily find an alternative form for a non-regular leaf is the
origin as a degenerate leaf in a semisimple Lie algebra: Here we can
choose $a=0$ since all maps $X$ into this leaf have only one image
point, which would correspond to a form $\wtO$ which is not compatible
with $\CP$ in a neighborhood of the leaf. In this case, the
transversal Lie algebra agrees with the Lie algebra itself such that
all solutions for $A$ are given by Lie algebra valued connections with
the correct curvature (zero for $BF$ theories or given by the volume
form for Yang--Mills theories). Thus, the methods of the present paper
give us the well-known results also for a degenerate leaf, in which
case we obtain irreducible connections and a vanishing $X$.

In fact, this conclusion does not only apply to $BF$ and Yang--Mills,
which have a linear Poisson tensor, but to a general Poisson Sigma
Model as well provided that the image of $\CX$ is contractible in the
leaf $L$. In this case, one can choose the gauge in which the image of
$\CX$ is a single point where the previous remarks can be used. The
$A$-components tangential to the leaf in the given point must be zero
in this gauge owing to the first field equation, while the remaining
components are subject to the second field equation with structure
{\em constants\/} $P^{IJ},_K$ of the transversal Lie algebra. Thus,
up to gauge transformations,
$A$ has to be a flat transversal Lie algebra valued connection
whenever the $\CX\colon \S \to L$ in (\ref{sol1}) is of trivial
homotopy---so that $X$ can be gauged to be constant. The remaining
gauge freedom then gives the usual gauge transformations of a connection.

In this special case, the field equations of a general Poisson Sigma
Model can be reduced to those of $BF$-theory, and also the formulas we
obtained in Sec.~\ref{NonAbSol} for the dimensions of subspaces
${\CM}_{\mathrm{cl}}(\S)$ corresponding to different classes of leaves (regular or
non-regular) can be used. Regular leaves $L_{\rm reg}$ always
contribute solutions which form a subspace of dimension
$(\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}\pi_1(\S)+1){\rm codim}(L_{\rm reg},M)$ while a degenerate leaf
$L_{\rm deg}$ yields $(\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}\pi_1(\S)-2){\rm codim}(L_{\rm deg},M)$.
Since ${\rm codim}(L_{\rm deg},M)>{\rm codim}(L_{\rm reg},M)$ for a
Poisson tensor of non-constant rank, the contribution of a degenerate leaf
will always dominate the solution space provided that the rank of the
fundamental group of $\S$ is large enough. Similarly, one can see that
the dimension of the solution space for any leaf $L$ (not necessarily
regular or degenerate) is approximately given by $\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}\pi_1(\S){\rm
codim}(L,M)$ for large rank of the fundamental group (this is the
contribution of connections taking values in the transversal Lie
algebra of dimension ${\rm codim}(L,M)$, while the contribution of
$X$-solutions is not proportional to the rank of the fundamental group
and thus sub-dominant). Therefore, regular leaves will not give a
dense subset of the solution space for large fundamental group of
$\S$, even when there are no degenerate leaves. In other words, the
leaves of the lowest dimension dominate the solution
space.
