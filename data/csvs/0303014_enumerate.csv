 \item{considering proper gauge fixing condition like the axial gauge $A^3_a=0$
 \cite{Axial,Lenz},}
 \item{applying quantization approaches in which there is no need
 to do gauge fixing \cite{Kla},}
 \item{using the celebrated BRST-BFV approach \cite{BRST,BFV} where one considers
 BRS transformation instead of gauge transformation \cite{Neu},}
 \item{and/or applying stochastic quantization method, see for example
 reference \cite{Zwan}.}
