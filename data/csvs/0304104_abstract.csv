Modifications of the electromagnetic Maxwell Lagrangian in four
dimensions have been considered by some authors \cite{jac}. One
may include an explicit massive term (Proca) and a topological but
not Lorentz-invariant term within certain observational limits.
  We find the dual-corresponding gauge invariant version of this theory
by using the recently suggested gauge embedding method. We enforce
this dualisation procedure by showing that, in many cases, this is
actually a constructive method to find a sort of parent action,
which manifestly establishes duality. We also use the gauge
invariant version of this theory to formulate a Batalin-Vilkovisky
quantization and present a detailed discussion on the excitation
spectrum.
