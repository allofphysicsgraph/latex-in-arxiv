	By combining a renormalization group argument
relating the charge $e$ and mass $m_p$ of the proton
by $e^2 \ln{m_p} \approx -\,0.1\pi$ (in Planck units)
with the Carter-Carr-Rees anthropic argument that gives
an independent approximate relation $m_p \sim e^{20}$
between these two constants, both can be crudely estimated.
These equations have the factor of $0.1\pi$ and the exponent of 20
which depend upon known discrete parameters
(e.g., the number of generations of quarks and leptons,
and the number of spatial dimensions),
but they contain {\it no} continuous observed parameters.
Their solution gives the charge of the proton correct to within about 8\%,
though the mass estimate is off by a factor of about 1000
(16\% error on a logarithmic scale).
When one adds a fudge factor of 10 previously given by Carr and Rees,
the agreement for the charge is within about 2\%,
and the mass is off by a factor of about 3
(2.4\% error on a logarithmic scale).
If this 10 were replaced by 15, the charge agrees
within 1.1\% and the mass itself agrees within 0.7\%.
