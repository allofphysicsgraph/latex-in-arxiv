Assuming spherical symmetry we analyse the dynamics of an
inhomogeneous dark radiation vaccum on a Randall and Sundrum 3-brane
world. Under certain natural conditions we show that the effective
Einstein equations on the brane form a closed system. On a de Sitter
brane and for negative dark energy density we determine exact
dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions which depend on the brane
cosmological constant, on the dark radiation tidal charge and on its
initial configuration. We also identify the conditions leading to the
formation of a singularity or of regular bounces inside the dark
radiation vaccum.
