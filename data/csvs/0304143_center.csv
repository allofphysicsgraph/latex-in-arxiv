Hermitean Metric.}\\

Assume that the metric $h_{M N}$ in an $m$ dimensional complex space is 
Hermitean. Hermiticity implies that $h_{i j} = h_{\bar{i j}} = 0$. Thus, 
in the $2m \times 2m$ dimensional matrix which would conventionally be used to 
represent the metric, there are only $4m^2 - m^2 - m^2$ entries which are 
non-zero and 
none of these are along the diagonal. Using then the fact that a metric 
must be symmetric, we find that the degrees of freedom are reduced by a 
further half, leaving only $m^2$ entries to determine the metric completely. 
These can be arranged into an $m \times m$ matrix which specifies 
the Hermitean metric.

Consider a simple example to illustrate this point: Let $h_{M N}$ be the metric
in a $2m$ real dimensional space. 
$$ {\rm det} \; h_{M N} = \frac{1}{(2m)!} \epsilon^{I_1 \dots I_{2m}} 
\epsilon^{J_1 \dots J_{2m}} h_{I_1 J_1} \dots h_{I_{2m} J_{2m}} $$
If a complex structure is defined on this space, the anti-symmetric
tensor $\epsilon^{I_1 \dots I_{2m}}$ splits up into a product of
two tensors, with holomorphic and anti-holomorphic indices as follows:
$$ \frac{1}{(2m)!} \epsilon^{I_1 \dots I_{2m}} = \frac{1}{m!} 
\epsilon^{i_1 \dots i_{m}} \frac{1}{m!} 
\epsilon^{\bar{j}_1 \dots \bar{j}_{m}} $$
If this complex structure is such that the resulting 
metric is hermitean, the determinant can be written as
$$
h \equiv {\rm det} \; h_{M N} = [{\rm det} \; h_{i {\bar{j}}} ]^2 $$
where 
$$ {\rm det} \; h_{i {\bar{j}}} =  \frac{1}{m!} \epsilon^{i_1 \dots
i_m} \epsilon^{{\bar{j}}_1 \dots {\bar{j}}_m} h_{i_1 {\bar{j}}_1} 
h_{i_2 {\bar{j}}_2}  \dots h_{i_m {\bar{j}}_m}$$}}

Live!}\\

We pause for a minute to see what these constraints say about the spinor. Take
a simple constraint, say $\Gamma_{u} \chi = 0$. 
Since $\Gamma_{u}$ is a creation operator, it acts on $\psi$ such that 
all states with $n_u = 0$ are taken to $n_u = 1$ but states which already 
had $n_u = 1$ are killed. Writing this out we find
$$\Gamma_{u} \psi = a |100> + b |110> + c |101> + d |111> = 0$$
Since all Fock space states are independent, this implies that
$a = b = c = d = 0$.
The spinor $\psi$ can now only have the components $|000>, |010> , |001>$ and 
$|011>$ 
Hence, in effect what a constraint of the type $\Gamma \psi = 0$ does is to
kill the spinors which survive the action of $\Gamma$ and keep the spinors
which were eliminated!}}

{\noindent}
A flat M5-brane can be thought of as being wrapped on a trivial supersymmetric
cycle embedded into a subspace of 11-dimensional spacetime. Take this 
subspace to be ${\mathbb C}^3$, spanned by holomorphic coordinates 
$u, v, w$. Two equations $f = f(u,v,w) = 0$ and $g = g(u,v,w) = 0$ are then 
needed 
to define a holomorphic two-cycle. If these equations are $v = 0$ 
and $w = 0$, the two-cycle in question is simply the complex $u$ plane. 

In the presence of a flat M5-brane with worldvolume $0123u\bar{u}$, the 
spacetime metric is given by: 
$$ds^2 = H^{-1/3} (- dt^2  +  dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 + du d{\bar u}) + 
H^{2/3} (dv d{\bar v} + dw d{\bar w} + dy^2) $$
where 
$$H = \frac{{\rm constant}}{(|v|^2 + |w|^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$$

In general, an M5-brane wrapping a Riemann surface embedded in ${\mathbb C}^3$ is 
expected
to give rise to a metric of the form \cite{Us}:
$$ds^2 = H^{-1/3} (- dt^2  +  dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2) + 2 G_{M {\bar N}} 
dz^M dz^{\bar N} + H^{2/3} dy^2 $$
Comparing the two expressions and defining a 
re-scaled Hermitean metric $g_{M {\bar N}} = H^{-1/6} G_{M {\bar N}}$, we find
$$2 g_{u {\bar u}} = H^{- 1/2} \; \; , \; \; 2 g_{v {\bar v}} =  H^{1/2}
\; \; , \; \; 2 g_{w {\bar w}} = H^{1/2}.$$ 
It can trivially be seen that this metric is not Kahler; moreover
since a Kahler metric cannot be obtained even by rescaling, 
$g_{M {\bar N}}$ is not warped Kahler either. However, the components 
of this blatantly non-Kahler metric satisfy the following curious relations: 
\begin{equation}
\partial_u (g_{v {\bar v}} g_{w {\bar w}}) =
\partial_v (g_{u {\bar u}} g_{w {\bar w}}) =
\partial_w (g_{u {\bar u}} g_{v {\bar v}}) = 0.
\end{equation}
In terms of the Hermitean form 
$\omega = i g_{M {\bar N}} dz^M dz^{\bar N}$ associated with the metric, 
this can be re-expressed as follows:
$$\partial [\omega \wedge \omega] = 0 \; \; {\rm but} \; \; \partial \omega 
\neq 0 $$ }}

\noindent\fbox{\noindent\parbox{5in}{{\sf \bf The Harmonic Function
Rule is Safe!}\\

We now show how this new ansatz encompasses and generalises the
harmonic function rule, using the above example to illustrate the
point. The Fayyazuddin-Smith metric ansatz for this system 
can be written as
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = H^{2/3}  [ H^{-1} \eta_{\mu \nu} dX^{\mu} dX^{\nu}
+ 2 H^{- 1} g_{M {\bar N}} dz^{M} dz^{\bar N} +
\delta_{\alpha \beta} dX^{\alpha} dX^{\beta}] \nonumber
\end{equation}
For ease of comparison, the metric dictated by the harmonic function
rule can also be written using complex coordinates on the embedding
(relative transverse) space. Defining $u = X^2 + i X^3$, $v = X^4 + i
X^5$ and $w = X^6 + i X^7$, this metric takes the form
\begin{eqnarray}
ds^2 &=& H_1^{2/3}  H_2^{2/3} H_3^{2/3}
[H_1^{-1}  H_2^{-1} H_3^{-1}(- dX_{0}^2 + dX_{1}^2) 
+ H_1^{-1}  H_2^{-1} du d\bar{u} \nonumber \\ 
&+&  H_1^{-1} H_3^{-1} dv d\bar{v} 
+ H_2^{-1} H_3^{-1} dw d\bar{w}
+ (dX_{8}^2 + dX_{9}^2 +dX_{10}^2)] \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Comparing the two expressions, one can immediately see that
\begin{equation}
H = H_1 H_2 H_3, \;\;\;
2 g_{u {\bar u}} = H_3, \;\;\; 
2 g_{v {\bar v}} = H_2, \;\;\; 
2 g_{w {\bar w}} = H_1 \nonumber
\end{equation}
and all other components of $g_{M {\bar N}}$ are zero. Since
$H_1, H_2$ and $H_3$ are only functions of the overall transverse
coordinates, it follows that H must be too, so $\partial_{M} H =
0$. Substituting in (\ref{fieldstrengthfsansatz}), we find that this
implies $F_{8 9 (10) M} = 0$
and $F_{N \bar{M} \beta \gamma} \propto \eta_{N \bar{M}}$ such that
\begin{eqnarray} 
F_{u \bar{u} \beta \gamma} &=& \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\beta \gamma \alpha}
\partial_{\alpha} H_3, \; \; \; \; 
F_{u \bar{u} \beta \gamma} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\beta \gamma \alpha}
\partial_{\alpha} H_2 \nonumber\\
F_{u \bar{u} \beta \gamma} &=& \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\beta \gamma \alpha}
\partial_{\alpha} H_1 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
in perfect agreement with the results obtained in (\ref{fstm5c3}). 

It should by now be clear, through this explicit discussion, that the
Harmonic Function Rule is the restriction of the Fayyazuddin-Smith
ansatz to cases where H is not allowed to depend on the embedding
space!}}

If $\omega$ is the two-form associated with the Hermitean metric on a manifold 
${\cal M}$ of complex dimension $n$, and $*$ denotes the Hodge dual on this 
space, 
then we have the following:
\begin{eqnarray}
{* \omega}_{{\bar P}_2 \dots {\bar P}_n Q_2 \dots Q_n}
&=& \sqrt{{\rm det } g} \; {\epsilon}^{M_1}_{\; \; {\bar P}_2 \dots {\bar P}_n}

&=& \sqrt{{\rm det } g} \; g^{M_1 {\bar S_1}} g^{R_1 \bar{N_1}} 
\tilde{\epsilon}_{\bar{S_1} {\bar P}_2 \dots {\bar P}_n}
\tilde{\epsilon}_{R_1 Q_2 \dots Q_n} i  g_{M_1 \bar{N}_1} \nonumber \\

\tilde{\epsilon}_{\bar{S_1} {\bar P}_2 \dots {\bar P}_n}
\tilde{\epsilon}_{R_1 Q_2 \dots Q_n}
\end{eqnarray}
Substituting now the expression for the inverse metric
\begin{equation}
g^{R_1 {\bar S_1}} = \frac{1}{(n-1)!}  \frac{1}{\sqrt{{\rm det}g}} 
\tilde{\epsilon}^{\bar{S_1} {\bar S}_2 \dots {\bar S}_n}
\tilde{\epsilon}^{R_1 R_2 \dots R_n} g_{R_2 {\bar S}_2} \dots 
g_{R_n {\bar S}_n}

we find that
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{ccc}
i^{(n-2)} * \omega & = & (\underbrace{\omega \wedge \omega 
\wedge ..... \omega \wedge 
\omega})\\
 &  & (n - 1)

As a 'check' of the above, note that wedging both sides with $\omega$ gives 
the 
identity 
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\omega \wedge * \omega & = &
