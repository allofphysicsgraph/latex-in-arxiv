{\bf Abstract}
\end{center}

\noindent

We study the noncommutative version of the extended ADHM construction 
in the eight dimensional $U(1)$ Yang-Mills theory. 
This construction gives rise to the solutions of the BPS equations 
in the Yang-Mills theory, 
and these solutions preserve at least 3/16 of supersymmetries.  
In a wide subspace of the extended ADHM data, 
we show that the integer $k$ which appears in the extended ADHM construction 
should be interpreted as the $D4$-brane charge 
rather than the $D0$-brane charge  
by explicitly calculating the topological charges 
in the case that the noncommutativity parameter is anti-self-dual. 
We also find the relationship with the solution generating technique 
and show that the integer $k$ can be interpreted 
as the charge of the $D0$-brane bound to the $D8$-brane with the $B$-field 
in the case that the noncommutativity parameter is self-dual.
