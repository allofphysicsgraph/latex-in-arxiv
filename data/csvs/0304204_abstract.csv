The large-group behavior of the nonlocal YM$_2$'s and gYM$_2$'s on a
cylinder or a disk is investigated. It is shown that this behavior is
similar to that of the corresponding local theory, but with the area of the
cylinder replaced by an effective area depending on the dominant
representation. The critical areas for nonlocal YM$_2$'s on a cylinder with
some special bounary conditions are also obtained.
