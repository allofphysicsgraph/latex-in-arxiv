We present a new model of inflation in which the inflaton is 
the extra component of a gauge field in a 5d theory compactified on a
circle.
The chief merit of this model is that the potential comes only from non-local effects so that its 
flatness is not spoiled by higher dimensional operators or quantum gravity corrections. The model 
predicts a red spectrum ($n \simeq 0.96$) and a significant production of gravitational waves ($r \simeq 0.11$). 
We also comment on the relevance of this idea to quintessence.
