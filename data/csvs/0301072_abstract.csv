We compute the cosmological perturbations generated in the brane world inflation driven by the bulk inflaton. Different from the model that the inflation is a brane effect, we exhibit the modification of the power spectrum of scalar perturbations due to the existence of the fifth dimension. With the change of the initial vacuum, we investigate the dependence of the correction of the power spectrum on the choice of the vacuum.
