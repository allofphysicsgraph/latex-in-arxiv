Let $\Delta(iy)=F(y)+iG(y)$ be the real and imaginary parts of $\Delta(iy)$
for $y\in \mathbb{R}$. If all zeros of $\Delta(z)$ have negative real parts,
then the zeros of $F(y)$ and $G(y)$ are real, simple, alternate and
\be
\label{posc}
G'(y) F(y) - G(y) F'(y) \geq 0
\ee
for all $y\in \mathbb{R}$. Conversely, all zeros of $\Delta(z)$ will be in the left
half plane provided that either of the following conditions is satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{(i)} All the zeros of $F(y)$ and $G(y)$ are  real, simple, alternate 
and \eqref{posc} is satisfied for at least one $y\in \mathbb{R}$.
\item{(ii)} All the zeros of $F(y)$ are  real, and for each zero,
\eqref{posc} is satisfied.
\item{(iii)} All the zeros of $G(y)$ are  real, and for each zero,
\eqref{posc} is satisfied.

1,"\begin{theorem}{\bf Theorem 2} \label{th2} {\it Pontryagin (\cite{hale}, A.4)}
If $\epsilon$ is such that $\phi_r^{(s)}(\cos(iy+\epsilon),\sin(iy+\epsilon))$
is non vanishing for all $y\in\mathbb{R}$, then, for sufficiently large integers
$k$ the function $F(z)=f(z,\cos(z),\sin(z))$ has exactly $4ks+r$ zeros
in the strip $-2k\pi+\epsilon\leq \Re(z)\leq 2k\pi+\epsilon$. Consequently,
the function $F(z)$ will have only real roots iff, for sufficiently 
large integers $k$, it has exactly  $4ks+r$ real zeros
in the interval $I_k=[-2k\pi+\epsilon,2k\pi+\epsilon]$.
