\item[a.]
We choose the vacuum expectation value (vev) 
of $h(x)$ to be 0, which
ensures that the vev $\langle \Phi \rangle = v\mbox{{\sf 1}\mbox{\hspace*{-0.16em}}\rule{0.04em}{1.55ex}\mbox{\hspace*{0.1em}}}$ stays fixed at its classical value and
the perturbative fermion mass does not get 
renormalized, {\it i.e.} $m_f = m_f^{(0)}$.  This is equivalent to a ``no--tadpole''
renormalization condition and determines $c_3$.

\item[b.]
We fix the pole of the Higgs propagator to be at
the tree level mass, $m_h=m_h^{(0)}$, 
with residue 1. These conditions yield
$c_2$ and $c_4$.

\item[c.]
We have various choices to fix the remaining undetermined 
counterterm coefficient $c_1$. We choose to set the
residue of the pole of the gauge field propagator to 1 
in unitary gauge. Then the position of that pole, {\it i.e.} the mass
of the gauge field, $m_w$, is a prediction.
