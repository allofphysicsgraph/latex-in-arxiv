\item{Associated with the $SU(4)$ gauge symmetry, we conjecture there
  are 15 color carrying gauge 
  bosons--gluons--with zero rest mass and spin 1.  } 
\item{Being spin representations of $SU(4)$, our bosonic spinors are a
  direct sum of inequivalent bosonic (i.e., odd dimensional) irreps of
  $SU(4)$.  (These irreps need not be 
  UIR's, since they are dynamical, a superset of the unitary irreps.)}
\item{There are four possible $SU(3)$'s contained in $SU(4)$, so
  it is possible to identify the $SU(3)$ gluons of the strong
  interaction with $SU(4)$ gluons more or less directly, e.g.,
  $R\leftrightarrow M$, $G \leftrightarrow Y$ and $B\leftrightarrow
  C$, is typical of the four 
  alternative $SU(4)$ to $SU(3)$ decompositions.  We envisage two,
  three and four color combination particles may be possible.}
\item{Gluonium, glueballs, etc, exist for four colors (and four
  anti-colors) just as they exist for the three colors of standard
  QCD.  We expect like colors to repel and color-anticolor to attract,
  in analogy to the electromagnetic charge case. }
\item{The massive $W^\pm$ and $Z^0$ bosons cannot be gauge bosons,
  both because of their mass and their association with a broken
  symmetry.  We would suggest the $SU(2)$ spontaneous symmetry
  breaking is dynamical and not ``spontaneous'', and related to the
  $SU(4)$ covering symmetry in some way. They must be some
  sort of composite particles--glueballs--in the bosonic perspective.}   
\item{The massless spin 2 graviton, if it exists, may be
  some sort of glueball, or perhaps stem from some special
  representation of $SU(4)$. Note there are
  possible repulsive color interactions, so there 
  may be repulsive field boson interactions attributable to
  the fourth (gravitational) field as well as the attractive
  interaction 
  intermediated by the graviton.   To make the graviton massless
  limits the possible candidates considerably.  }
\item{In QCD, a significant percentage of mass of nucleons is
  associated with quark-gluon plasma.  Although the mixed notions of
  fermionic quark and bosonic gluon violate our notion of separation
  of perspectives, an identification of a bosonic analogue of the
  quark is indicated below.  We would conjecture that
  all mass is the result of color interactions, principally
  intermediated by 
  gluons.  (The other known source of mass, spontaneous symmetry
  breaking, does not seem available in this exact symmetry model.)}  
\item{In our dynamical treatment, we will find only bosons.  There is
  no proper place for quarks in this perspective, although there may
  be bosonic structures related to them (see below).  The bosonic and  
  fermionic $SU(4)$ representations need to be studied for their
  structure, and there should be similarities and correspondences
  between many, if not all, of the structures in the respective
  bosonic and fermionic perspectives.}
