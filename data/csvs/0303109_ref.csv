6,"\ref {ve}) is not well defined since the expected
 Regge trajectory is not bounded from above and therefore a
regularization is needed. Second, in the above sum (\ref {ve}) 
the $N$ dependence of each individual mode is $N^0$. The expected
UV $N^2$ dependence of the vacuum energy is hidden in the sum over
hadronic modes. Thus, though formally (\ref {ve}) represents the
cosmological constant of the theory, it is not the most efficient
way to calculate it. Below, we present an alternative way of calculating
it - which explains naturally the vanishing result. 

Let us consider the contribution to the cosmological constant
from the open string sector. At large $N$ it is dominated
 by the annulus diagram where each boundary consists of $N$ D-branes
and a summation over the various D-branes is assumed. 
The M\""obius and Klein-bottle as well as higher genus amplitudes
 are suppressed at large $N$. It is not surprising that the
cosmological constant vanishes, as we have $N^2$ bosons (NS open
strings) and $N^2$ fermions (Ramond fermionic open strings).

The annulus diagram has another interpretation. It represents
the force between the D branes. The force is mediated by
bosonic closed strings. In a SUSY setup (the type II string),
D branes are BPS objects --- hence,  the  zero force. 
As has been discussed above, the balance, at large separation, is achieved
in this case due to cancellation between the dilaton, the graviton
and the massless R-R forms.

It is interesting that the force between parallel selfdual D 
branes is zero
also in type 0 string theory 
\cite{Klebanov:1998yy,Angelantonj:1999qg}
\begin{equation}
{\cal A}= N^2 (V_8-S_8) \equiv 0
\end{equation}
 This is due to the underlying SUSY on
 the world-sheet. The mechanism is exactly as in the type II case:
 the R-R modes cancel the contributions of the NS-NS modes. 
 

This leads to an explanation of the ``mysterious''
 vanishing of the cosmological constant in the orientifold field
 theory:  if one
 views the hadrons (in the spirit of the AdS/CFT) as closed strings the
degenerate bosonic spectrum is the reason behind the zero result
for both wall-wall interaction and the cosmological constant.

The difference between string theory and field theory is that in
string theory the force between D branes, from the closed string
standpoint, is related to the contribution to the cosmological
constant from the open string sector. However, closed strings and
open strings are independent degrees of freedom,
 and so one has to add the contribution of the
 closed strings to the cosmological constant.
 In the gauge theory string
picture, the closed strings are simply hadrons made
out of the constituent open strings --- the gluons and quarks.
Therefore, the value of the cosmological constant can be determined by
either UV degrees of freedom or IR degrees of freedom. It is the
same quantity.

Perhaps the most interesting lesson from this picture is that the
cosmological constant can vanish  even though only bosonic IR
degrees of freedom are present in the given gauge theory (at least, to the leading order in
$N$). 
In addition, the ``correct'' calculation of the
cosmological constant in ${\cal N}=1\ $ SYM, using the IR degrees of freedom,
involves a cancellation among the degenerate bosons and omission
of the fermions!
 
\section{Non-supersymmetric Parent-Daughter
\\  Pairs}
\label{NSPDP}

\noindent

A simple proliferation of the fermion fields in the form of ``flavors''
leads to non-supersymmetric parent-daughter pairs.
This was first mentioned in Ref. \cite{Gorsky:2002wt}
in the context of ${\bf Z}_2\ $ orbifolds. The planar equivalence here holds perturbatively
\cite{Bershadsky:1998mb,Bershadsky:1998cb} but most likely fails
at the nonperturbative level.
If we use, as a starting point, ${\cal N}=1\ $ gluodynamics and its orientifold,
the planar equivalence has solid chances to hold
nonperturbatively.

Non-supersymmetric planar-equivalent pairs were mentioned in passing in 
Ref.~\cite{Armoni:2003gp}. For instance, gauge theories
with one and the same number of Dirac fermions either in the antisymmetric two-index
or symmetric two-index representations are planar equivalent.
Now we would like to discuss in more
detail parent-daughter 
pairs which are obtained from ${\cal N}=1\ $ gluodynamics and its orientifold
by introducing fermion replicas. Thus, as previously,
the parent and daughter theories share one and the same gauge group,
U($N$), and one and the same gauge coupling.
The two respective fermion sectors are:

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
(i) $k$ species of the Weyl fermions in the adjoint,
to be  denoted  as $\left(\lambda^A\right)^i_j$;


and 

\noindent
(ii)  $k$ species of the Dirac fermions
$\left( \Psi^A\right)_{[ij]}$. 

\vspace{1mm}

Here $i,\,j$ are (anti)fundamental indices
running $i,\,j=1,2,...,N$ while $A$ is the flavor index running
$A=1,2,..,k$. Note that $k\leq 5$. Otherwise we loose asymptotic freedom.
Each Dirac fermion is equivalent to two Weyl fermions,
$$
\Psi_{[ij]} \to \{ \eta_{[ij]}\,,\,\,\, \xi^{[ij]}\}\,.
$$


Of course, since both theories are non-supersymmetric,  predictive
power is significantly reduced compared to the case  of
a SUSY parent. 
Still, one can benefit from the comparison of both theories, in particular,
 the Goldstone meson
sectors.
Let us start with the case (ii), $k$ species of 
$ \Psi_{[ij]}$. Since the fermion fields are Dirac and in the complex 
representation of the gauge group, the theory has the same (nonanomalous) chiral symmetry
as QCD with $k$ flavors, namely,
SU($k)_L\times\mbox{SU}(k)_R$.  Various arguments tell us \cite{mac,triangle,rm}
that the pattern of the chiral symmetry breaking is the same as in QCD too,
namely
\begin{equation}
\mbox{SU}(k)_L\times\mbox{SU}(k)_R \to \mbox{SU}(k)_V\,.
\label{pcsbone}
\end{equation}
The only distinction is that in QCD the constant $f$ scales as $\sqrt{N}\,\Lambda$
while in our case its scaling law is ${N}\,\Lambda$. Moreover, the coefficient $n$
in front of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten term $\Gamma$ (see e.g. Ref.~\cite{Witten:tw})
equals $N$ in QCD and $(1/2) N(N-1)$ in the case at hand (see below).

All axial (nonanomalous) currents are spontaneously broken, giving rise
to $k^2 -1$ Goldstone mesons, ``pions.'' 
Some of them ---  those coupled to the  axial currents that can be elevated
from the daughter theory (ii)  to the parent theory (i) --- 
persist  in the parent theory (i), where the  fermion fields belong to the real
representation,
with the same coupling to the corresponding axial currents. This is
because of the planar equivalence of two theories.
(Remember, currents  with the structure $\bar\xi \xi -\bar\eta \eta$
cannot be elevated from (ii) to (i).)

It is 
not difficult to count the number of the axial currents that are elevated from (ii) to (i):
 there are
$(1/2)k(k-1)$ off-diagonal currents of the type $\bar\xi^A \xi^B +\bar\eta^A \eta^B$
($A\neq B$) plus all $k-1$ diagonal axial currents of the type
$\bar\xi^A \xi^A +\bar\eta^A \eta^A$ (no summation over $A$).
Altogether we get 
$$
\frac{k(k+1)}{2}-1
$$
Goldstone mesons. This obviously corresponds to the following pattern
of the chiral symmetry breaking:
\begin{equation}
\mbox{SU}(k) \to \mbox{SO}(k)\,,
\label{pcstwo}
\end{equation}
with the Goldstone mesons in the symmetric two-index representation of
$ \mbox{SO}(k)$. The pattern of the chiral symmetry breaking for the quarks
belonging to a real representation of the gauge group
indicated in Eq.~(\ref{pcstwo}) was advocated many times
in the literature \cite{mac,triangle,rm,Witten:tx}, but no 
complete proof was ever given.

We conclude this section by a brief comment on the topological properties
of the corresponding chiral Lagrangian
and how they match the underlying gauge field theory expectations.
The theory (i) is expected to be confining
and support flux tubes --- fundamental color charges cannot be screened.
On the other hand, we do not expect stable baryons with mass growing with N.
Composite color-singlet states of gluon and $\left(\lambda^A\right)^i_j$ form
baryons with $M\sim N^0$.

At the same time, the theory (ii) does {\em not} have baryons with
$M\sim N^0$. Here the baryon masses grow with $N$.
The theory is expected to be confining too,
but two flux tubes 
(each attached to a color source in the fundamental representation)
can be screened by $\left( \Psi^A\right)_{[ij]}$.

As was suggested in Refs.~\cite{Witten:tw,Witten:tx},
at large $N$ one can try to identify baryons with the 
Skyrmions supported by the corresponding chiral lagrangians.
Since
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\pi_3\left\{\mbox{SU}(k)/\mbox{O}(k)
\right\} = Z_4\,\,\,\mbox{at}\,\,\, k=3, \quad \pi_3\left\{\mbox{SU}(k)/\mbox{O}(k)
\right\} = Z_2\,\,\,\mbox{at}\,\,\, k\geq 4;\nonumber\\[2mm]
&&\pi_3\left\{\mbox{SU}(k)
\right\} = Z\,\,\,\mbox{at all}\,\,\, k 
\end{eqnarray}
both theories, (i) and (ii),  yield Skyrmions
with $M_{\rm Skyrme}\sim N^2$, albeit the theory (ii) has a richer spectrum.
The above scaling law,
$M_{\rm Skyrme}\sim N^2$,  is due to the fact that
$f$ scales as $ N$ in the theories under consideration.

 Skyrmion statistics is determined by
the (quantized) factor in front of the Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten term,
\begin{equation}
(-1)^{N(N-1)/2}\,.
\label{stat}
\end{equation}
It has half-integer spin provided that $N(N-1)/2$ is odd,
i.e. $N= 4p+2$ or $N= 4p+3$ where $p$ is an integer.
In both cases one can construct, in the microscopic theory,
interpolating baryon currents with an odd number of constituents
scaling as $N$. Why then the Skyrmion  mass scales  as $N^2$?
A possible explanation is as follows.
For quarks in the the fundamental representation of
SU($N$) the color wave function is antisymmetric,
which allows them all to be in the $S$ wave in the coordinate space.
With antisymmetric two-index spinor fields
the color wave function is symmetric, which would require them to 
occupy orbits with angular momentum up to $\sim N$.
Then the scaling law $M_{\rm Skyrme}\sim N^2$ seems natural.

Since $\pi_2\left\{\mbox{SU}(k)
\right\} = 0$ the chiral sector of the theory (ii) does not support flux tubes.
Albeit  disappointing, such a situation was anticipated by Witten
\cite{Witten:tx} who noted that topology of the full space 
of the large $N$ theory need not coincide with topology of 
its Goldstone sector.

In light of this remark we can understand the complete failure
of the Skyrmion description of the theory (i). In particular,
since $\pi_2\left\{\mbox{SU}(k)/\mbox{O}(k)
\right\}$ $ = Z_2$ at $ k\geq 3$
we get flux tubes in the chiral theory, while we do not expect them
in the microscopic theory. Moreover, stable Skyrmions of 
the chiral sector should become unstable in the full
theory.


\section{Conclusions}

\noindent

In this work we tried to further develop a parallel
between ${\cal N}=1\ $ gluody\-namics and its 
non-supersymmetric orientifold daughter on the one hand,
and string/D brane paradigm, on the other.
We discussed forces between two 
BPS domain walls in field theory terms
and established contact with the string theory description.
In the latter, there is a well-known cancellation between
NS-NS and R-R interactions. In field theory terms
this cancellation manifest itself as follows:
the exchange of a composite dilaton coupled
to the domain wall is canceled (at leading order)
by that of a composite axion.
The string-theory interpretation allows us to establish
a one-to-one relation between vanishing force and 
vanishing cosmological constant.
Thus, the question ``who is responsible for the
vanishing cosmological constant in non-supersymmetric orientifold
field theory?'' gets a rather unexpected answer ---
the degeneracy of the even-odd parity composite mesons.

In the last part of the paper we 
discuss  ``flavor proliferation''
as a device allowing one to get
 planar equivalent pairs
in which both theories in the parent-daughter pair are
non-supersymmetric, starting from the original pair ---
${\cal N}=1\ $ gluodynamics and its orientifold daughter.
Although we loose predictive power based on supersymmetry
of the parent, some  predictions survive.
In particular, we compare Goldstone meson sectors,
and obtain consequences for the
patterns of the chiral symmetry breaking.
