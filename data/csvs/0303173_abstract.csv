{ We propose a Matrix Theory approach to 
Romans' massive Type IIA supergravity. It is obtained 
by applying the procedure of Matrix Theory compactifications 
to Hull's proposal  of the Massive Type IIA 
String Theory as M-Theory on a twisted  torus. 
The resulting Matrix Theory is a super-Yang Mills theory 
on large $N$ three-branes with a space dependent non-commutativity 
parameter, which is also independently derived by a T-duality approach. We give evidence showing that 
the energies of a class of physical excitations 
of the super-Yang Mills theory show the correct 
symmetry expected from Massive Type IIA string theory 
in a lightcone quantization. 
%We briefly discuss the generalization of 
%our methods to the case of  Massive  reductions  of 
%M-Theory which  admit de Sitter  space solutions.
