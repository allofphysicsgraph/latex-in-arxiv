Closed string tachyons have long been somewhat mysterious.
We note that there is often a regime in the classical moduli space
in which one
can systematically compute the effective action for such
fields.  In this regime, the tachyon is light, and cannot be
integrated out.  Instead, one must consider the combined dynamics
of gravitons, moduli, tachyons and other light fields.  We compute
the action and find that the quartic term for the
tachyon is positive in the field definition where the
tachyon has no derivative coupling to the radion. We study
the evolution of isotropic, homogeneous configurations and find that
typically the system is driven to regions where the calculation is no longer
under control.
