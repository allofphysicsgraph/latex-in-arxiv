In this paper we study strings with quantized masses in the pp-wave
backgrounds. We obtain these strings from the membrane theory. For
achieving to this, one of the membrane and one of the spacetime directions
will be identified and wrapped. From the action of strings in the
quantized pp-wave backgrounds, we obtain its
mass dual action. Some properties of the closed and open strings in these
backgrounds will be studied.
