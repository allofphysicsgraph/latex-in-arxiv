Affine Kac-Moody algebras give rise to interesting systems of differential 
equations, so-called
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The monodromy properties of their solutions
can be encoded in the structure of a mo\-du\-lar tensor category on 
(a subcategory
of) the representation category of the affine Lie algebra. We discuss the 
relation between these solutions and physical correlation functions
in two-dimensional conformal field theory.
In particular we report on a proof for the existence of the latter on 
world sheets of arbitrary topology.
