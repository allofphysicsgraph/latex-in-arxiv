Case when the background is asymptotically flat, $V\rightarrow 1$ at
infinity~: near infinity our D3-brane is nearly flat and 
we can solve the equations for its shape,
\begin{eqnarray}
K=v_\mu X^\mu \left(V+\frac{\lambda}{r}+O(\frac{1}{r^3})\right),
\end{eqnarray}
with $V=1+\frac{kl_s^2}{r^2}+O(\frac{1}{r^3})$. The quantized
parameter $\lambda$ measures the number of D1s bound to the flat D3,
i.e. the D1-brane charge of the D3, as can be seen by computing the
quantity $I$, Eq. (\ref{RR}), near infinity. 
\item
$\R_\Phi\times SU(2)$: the background is defined by
$V=\frac{kl_s^2}{r^2}$, 
and the branes by
$K=\frac{v_\mu X^\mu}{r}$ for any constant $v_\mu$. 
These branes extend along the
whole linear dilaton direction, times a standard $S^2$ conjugacy class
in $SU(2)$ \cite{bds}.
\item Superposed NS5-branes: $V=1+\frac{kl_s^2}{r^2}$, the partial
  differential equation on $K$ reduces to a differential equation
  after assuming $K(\vf,r)$. See \cite{pelc} for more details.
