A path integral formula for
the associative star-product of two superfields is proposed. 
It is a generalization of the Kontsevich-Cattaneo-Felder's formula for
the star-product of functions of bosonic coordinates. 
The associativity of the star-product imposes certain conditions on the background of  our sigma model.
 For generic background the 
action is not supersymmetric. The supersymmetry invariance of
the action constrains the background and leads to a simple formula
for the star-product.
