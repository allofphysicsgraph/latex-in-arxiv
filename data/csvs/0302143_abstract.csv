We investigate some issues regarding quantum corrections for
de Sitter branes in a bulk AdS$_5$ spacetime. The one-loop 
effective action for a Majorana spinor field is evaluated and compared 
with the scalar field result.
We also evaluate the cocycle function for various boundary conditions, 
finding that the quantum corrections naturally induce higher order 
curvature terms in the original action and, in general, it is not possible to 
eliminate the cocycle function by renormalisation. In the one brane 
limit care must be taken on how one extracts physical results. The 
effective potential is found to be zero on the conformally related cylinder. 
However, using the actual metric, the contribution from the cocycle function is
non-zero 
and must be included. Subtleties with any zero modes are also discussed.
