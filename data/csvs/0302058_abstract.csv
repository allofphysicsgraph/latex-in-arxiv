Some recent studies have implied that quantum fluctuations 
will prevent a near-extremal black hole from ever
attaining a state of precise extremality.  
In this paper, we consider the analogous situation
for the scenario of a nearly degenerate Schwarzschild-de Sitter
black hole (of arbitrary dimensionality).
For this purpose, we utilize a holographic type of 
duality between the solutions of interest and 
the near-massless sector of (two-dimensional) Jackiw-Teitelboim theory.
After explicitly demonstrating this duality, we go
on to argue that, on the basis of one-loop
considerations, a similar censorship applies
in  this de Sitter context. That is, quantum
back-reaction effects will conspire to 
prohibit a non-degenerate Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime
 from continuously evolving into a
degenerate ({\it i.e.}, Nariai) black hole solution.
