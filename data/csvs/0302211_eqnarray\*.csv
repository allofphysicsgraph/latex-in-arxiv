As the narrow resonance approximation breaks down 
the DOZZ version of the Liouville theory 
does not provide an adequate description of the longitudinal excitations of 
non-critical Nambu-Goto string. Let us mention that 
a possible way out was proposed by Gervais \cite{Gervais:1990be}.
It consists in the truncation of spectrum to some discrete subset.
However due to technicalities involved
\cite{Gervais:1994ec,Gervais:1996vp}
it is still not clear whether this approach may lead to consistent string models in
non-critical dimensions. 

\section{Geometric bootstrap hypothesis}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

As we have seen in Sect.3 if we restrict ourselves to the spectrum of
free non-critical Nambu-Goto string  
the  PPPE has to be lifted.
The only  approach to the Liouville theory
where PPPE is not assumed is the so called geometric formulation of the 2-dim
quantum gravity \cite{Polyakov82,Takhtajan:1993vt,Takhtajan:zi,Takhtajan:1994vt,Takhtajan:1995fd}.
In this approach
the Liouville correlation functions
are defined  in terms of path integral over conformal class of Riemannian metrics
with prescribed  singularities at the punctures.
The results obtained in the case of  parabolic singularities \cite{Takhtajan:1993vt,Takhtajan:zi,Takhtajan:1994vt}
are in perfect agreement with the properties of the
Liouville sector summarized in Sect.3. An additional support for the  geometrical approach
comes from  the fact that some of its geometric
predictions  can be rigorously proved
(\cite{Takhtajan:zi,Takhtajan:1994vt}, and references therein).
In spite of considerable achievements 
the geometric approach  is not yet capable to
produce the puncture correlators. It can however be 
used  to  analyze their factorization
properties. 


%We shall start with some remarks on the spectrum of conformal weights.
In  the weak coupling regime $c>25$ 
we are interested in 
correlators of local operators with conformal weights satisfying the Seiberg bound $\Delta < {Q^2\over 4}$.
If the theory is coupled to conformal matter such operators are necessary for the  gravitational dressing.
They are supposed to correspond to microscopic, non-normalizable states with imaginary Liouville momenta
\cite{sei}. 
In the geometric approach
they are described by conical (elliptic) singularities with the opening angle $\nu$ related to the imaginary Liouville
momentum $P$ by 
$$
\Delta= \frac{Q^2}{4} + P^2 \; = \;  \frac{Q^2}{4}\left(1-\left(\frac{\nu}{2\pi}\right)^2\right)
$$ 
These operators do not appear  when  the Liouville theory is regarded
as the model for the longitudinal  string excitations in physical dimensions $1<c<25$. 
Indeed the derivation of the light-cone amplitudes
shows that  only the parabolic singularities (limiting case of the conical singularity with
the opening angle $\nu=0$) are relevant for the description of external states. 
The states with imaginary Liouville momenta are also not expected in  factorization
of puncture correlators. 



In order to describe the factorization one has to extend  the geometric approach 
to surfaces with finite holes. 
We assume that the Liouville action and the space of metrics in the path integral
are chosen in such a way that 
the classical solution corresponds to the hyperbolic metric with the
curvature $-\mu<0$ and
the geodesic boundary. We also assume that the  conformal weight of the hole 
is 
$$
\Delta_\ell = \frac{Q^2}{4}\left(1 + \frac{\mu \ell^2}{8\pi^2}\right)
$$
where $\ell$ is the length of the hole circumference  measured with
respect to the metric with constant  
negative curvature $R=-\mu$.  It  depends only on the conformal
class of metrics over which the path integral is taken. 
This assumption is motivated by the properties of the energy--momentum 
tensor of the classical hyperbolic solutions on the cylinder and on sphere
with holes (black-hole solutions in 3-dim gravity). The puncture corresponds to the limiting 
case of the hole with zero circumference. 
Since in the case of puncture
the classical conformal dimension does not receive quantum corrections one may expect 
that this is so for the holes as well (up to the renormalization of the cosmological
constant $\mu$). 


Let us now consider the simplest case of 4-puncture correlator.
In the geometric approach it is given by the path integral over the conformal
class of metrics  with parabolic singularities at
puncture locations. Since the conformal weight of the puncture is fixed 
 the space of metric fluctuations   at each puncture is  completely described
by ${\cal L}_n$ operators defined in (\ref{statepuncture}) and coincides
with the space of longitudinal excitations of 
the free string. 
The Liouville action and the space of metrics in the  path integral are
chosen in such a way that for each configuration  
of punctures
one gets a unique  classical solution corresponding to the hyperbolic
metric with scalar curvature $-1.$  
There are three closed geodesics $\Gamma_s,\Gamma_t,\Gamma_u$ in this
geometry separating the punctures into 
pairs (12,34), (13,24), (14,23), respectively.
Let us  cut the
path integral open along the geodesic $\Gamma_s$
 dividing $S$ into the spheres $S_{12},S_{34}$ with one hole and two
punctures ($S=S_{12}\cup S_{34},$ 
$\Gamma_s=S_{12}\cap S_{34}$). 
The classical solution $g$ on $S$ determines classical solutions
$g_{12}$ on $S_{12}$ and $g_{34}$ on $S_{34}.$ 
The initial path integral factorizes into a path integral over the conformal class of $g_{12}$,
 a path integral over the conformal class of $g_{34}$ 
and the integration  over all possible intermediate states.
According to our assumptions the holes on $S_{12}$ and  $S_{34}$
have the same conformal dimension $\Delta_s=
 \frac{Q^2}{4}\left(1 + \frac{\mu \ell_s^2}{8\pi^2}\right)
$ uniquely determined by  the
length $\ell_s$ of the common boundary. It follows that factorization in
each channel involves exactly one conformal family. 
%ground  state.
%The conformal structure of the theory implies that all possible metric  fluctuations along the cut
%are completely described by appropriate ${\cal L}_n$ operators.
%Thus only one conformal family appears in factorization.
Its  conformal weight depends on the channel and the moduli of the surface.
This is in sharp contrast with 
the DOZZ description  of the weak coupling 
regime where the factorization is independent both of the channel and of the moduli and
involves integration over continuous spectrum of conformal families.



Before we formulate the consistency conditions of the geometric factorization 
introduced above 
some comments on the hole-state correspondence are in order. First of
all since the length of the geodesic 
boundary can assume any positive value one needs a continuous spectrum of conformal weights
$\Delta \geqslant {Q^2\over 4}$ of intermediate states. This however does not necessary mean that
the space of states has to be extended. 
The crucial observation is that 
the geometric factorizaton on exactly one conformal family allows to  interpret the conformal 
weight as a characteristic of the energy--momentum tensor behavior
around the hole 
rather than a characteristic of intermediate states attached to its boundary.
Such interpretation is consistent with our choice of the space of free string states.
Indeed for the central charge in the range $1<c<25$ and $\Delta \geqslant {Q^2\over 4}$ 
one can use the oscillator realization of
the Verma module ${\cal V}_{Q^2\over 4}$ to construct 
the local operator $T_{\scriptscriptstyle P}(z)$.
$$
T_{\scriptscriptstyle P}(z)=
\sum\limits_{n}L_n^{\scriptscriptstyle P} z^{-n-2} \;\;\;,
\;\;\;L_n^{\scriptscriptstyle P}\;=\;\left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
L_n^{\scriptscriptstyle L} + 2Pc_n &{\rm for}& n\neq 0\\
L_0^{\scriptscriptstyle L} + {P^2} &{\rm for}& n= 0
\end{array}
\right.
$$ 
where $P$ is a real positive number (the Liouville momentum) \cite{Fairlie}.
One can easyly verify that  $T_{\scriptscriptstyle P}(z)$ satisfies
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
T_{\scriptscriptstyle P}
(w)T_{\scriptscriptstyle P}(z)
&=&{\frac12 (1+6Q^2)\over (w-z)^4 }
+ {2 \over (w-z)^2}T_{\scriptscriptstyle P}(z)
+{ 1\over w-z}\partial T_{\scriptscriptstyle P}(z)
 + \dots \ , \\
\label{Tsingularity}
T_{\scriptscriptstyle P}(z)
\Omega
&=& {\Delta\over z^2}
\Omega
+ {1\over z}L^{\scriptscriptstyle P}_{-1}
\Omega
+ {\rm regular \; terms}\ . 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta = {Q^2\over 4}+{P^2}$.
With an appropriate choice of the coordinates around the hole, the state-hole correspondence 
takes the form
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{statehole}
L^{\rm \scriptscriptstyle P}_{-n_1}\dots
L^{\rm \scriptscriptstyle P}_{-n_N} |\,0\,\rangle^{\rm
\scriptscriptstyle L}
 & \longrightarrow  &
 {\cal L}_{-n_1}\dots
 {\cal L}_{-n_N}
 \cdot
 H_\ell(z,\bar z)
 \\
 & \equiv &
 {1\over (2\pi i)^N} \oint_{C_1} dz_1
 {T(z_1)\over (z_1-z)^{n_1-1}}
 \dots
 \oint_{C_N} dz_N{T(z_N)\over (z_N-z)^{n_N-1}}
 H_\ell(z,\bar z)\ .\nonumber
 \end{eqnarray}
As in the case of punctures  one can associate to each state
${\xi\otimes\bar\xi\in{\cal F}^{\rm \scriptscriptstyle L}\otimes \widetilde{{\cal F}^{\rm \scriptscriptstyle L}}}$
a uniquely determined object
$V_\ell^{\rm \scriptscriptstyle L}(\xi,\bar \xi | z,\bar z)$ which we shall call 
the vertex corresponding to to the state $\xi\otimes \bar \xi$ applied at the 
hole of the circumference $\ell$.
We have assumed  that the location of the hole can be defined 
as a point at which the analytic continuation of the energy--momentum tensor issingular.


Although the correlators of punctures, holes, and in general, vertexes
are not realized as vacuum expectation values 
of operators in some Hilbert space all their conformal properties are 
exactly the same as in the standard CFT. 
In particular  an arbitrary three vertex correlator is determined up to
the structure constant 
$C(\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3)$. It takes the form
\begin{eqnarray*}
& &\hspace{-60pt}\left\langle \, 
 V^{\rm \scriptscriptstyle L}_{\ell_1}(\xi_1,\bar \xi_1 |z_1,\bar z_1)
V^{\rm \scriptscriptstyle L}_{\ell_2}(\xi_2,\bar \xi_2 |z_2,\bar z_2)
V^{\rm \scriptscriptstyle L}_{\ell_3}(\xi_3,\bar \xi_3 |z_3,\bar z_3)\,\right\rangle \;= \;C(\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3) \\
& \times &{\rho^{\ell_1\,\ell_2\,\ell_3}(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)\over 
(z_1 -z_2)^{\Delta_1+\Delta_2-\Delta_3}
(z_1 -z_3)^{\Delta_1+\Delta_3-\Delta_2}
(z_2 -z_3)^{\Delta_2+\Delta_3-\Delta_1} }\\
&\times &
{\rho^{\ell_1\,\ell_2\,\ell_3}(\bar\xi_1,\bar\xi_2,\bar\xi_3)\over 
(\bar z_1 -\bar z_2)^{\bar\Delta_1+\bar\Delta_2-\bar\Delta_3}
(\bar z_1 -\bar z_3)^{\bar\Delta_1+\bar\Delta_3-\bar\Delta_2}
(\bar z_2 -\bar z_3)^{\bar\Delta_2+\bar\Delta_3-\bar\Delta_1} }
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\Delta_i = \Delta_{\ell_i} +|\xi_i|$, $\bar\Delta_i = \Delta_{\ell_i} +|\bar\xi_i|$.
The  trilinear forms $\rho^{\ell_1\,\ell_2\,\ell_3}(\xi_1,\xi_2,\xi_3)$, universal for all CFT,
are uniquely determined by CWI \cite{Teschner:2001rv}.
Also the notion of the conformal block 
remains unchanged
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal F}_{Q,\,\ell}\left[
^{\ell_3\,\ell_2}_{\ell_4\,\ell_1 }  
\right]\!(z)&=& z^{\Delta_\ell -\Delta_{\ell_2} -\Delta_{\ell_1}}
\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} z^n {\cal F}_{Q,\,\ell}\left[
^{\ell_3\,\ell_2}_{\ell_4\,\ell_1 }  
\right]\!(n)\\
{\cal F}_{Q,\,\ell}\left[
^{\ell_3\,\ell_2}_{\ell_4\,\ell_1 }  
\right]\!(n) &=& \sum\limits_{I,J \in {\cal I}_n} 
\rho^{\ell_4\,\ell_3\,\ell}(\omega,\omega,\xi_I)B_{Q,\ell}^{IJ}(n)
\rho^{\ell\;\;\ell_2\,\ell_1}(\xi_J,\omega,\omega) \ .
\end{eqnarray*}
(In the formulae above $\omega$ denotes the vacuum state in ${\cal
F}^{\scriptscriptstyle L},$
$\left\{ \xi_I \right\}_{I\in {\cal I}_n}$ is a basis on the level $n$ in ${\cal F}^{\scriptscriptstyle L}$,
and $B_{Q,\ell}^{IJ}(n)$ is the inverse to the Gramm matrix on the level $n$ in the Verma module with
the central charge $ c=1 +6Q^2$ and the highest weight 
$\Delta_\ell = \frac{Q^2}{4}\left(1 + \frac{\mu \ell^2}{8\pi^2}\right)$.)


In the simplest case of the four puncture correlator, 
\[
G^{\scriptscriptstyle L}(x,\bar x)
\; = \; \lim\limits_{z,\bar z\to \infty} z^{Q^2\over 2}\bar z{}^{Q^2\over 2}
 \left\langle
  P(z,\bar z)P(1,1)P(x,\bar x)P(0,0)
  \right\rangle\ ,
\]
the geometric factorization in the $s$-channel reads
$$
G^{\scriptscriptstyle L}(x,\bar x)= C(0,0,\ell_s)C(\ell_s,0,0) 
\left|{\cal F}_{Q,\,\ell_s}\!\left[^{\,0\;0\,}_{\,0\;0\,}
\right]\!(x)\right|^2\ ,
$$
where $\ell_s$ is the length of the closed geodesic $\Gamma_s$. 
Since $\ell_s(x,\bar x)$ is a real analytic function of the moduli parameter $x$
of the 4-punctured sphere the amplitude does not factorizes into a holomorphic
and an anti-holomorphic part. 

The basic  consistency condition is that the geometric factorization in each channel yields the
same result. In the slightly more general case of the four hole correlator it leads to the 
geometric bootstrap equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\hspace{-50pt} C(\ell_4,\ell_3,\ell_s)C(\ell_s,\ell_2,\ell_1)
\left|{\cal F}_{Q,\,\ell_s}\!\left[^{\ell_3\,\ell_2}_{\ell_4\,\ell_1 }  \right]\!(x)\right|^2\\
&=&
C(\ell_4,\ell_1,\ell_t)C(\ell_t,\ell_2,\ell_1)
\left|{\cal F}_{Q,\,\ell_t}\!\left[^{\ell_1\,\ell_2}_{\ell_4\,\ell_3 }  \right]\!(1-x)\right|^2\\
&=&
|x|^{-4\Delta_{\ell_2}} C(\ell_1,\ell_3,\ell_u)C(\ell_u,\ell_2,\ell_4)
\left|{\cal F}_{Q,\,\ell_u}\!\left[^{\ell_3\,\ell_2}_{\ell_1\,\ell_4 }  \right]
\!\left({\textstyle {1\over x}}\right)\right|^2
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\ell_s, \ell_t, \ell_s$ are the lengths of the closed geodesics in corresponding channels.
As in the standard CFT one can promote the geometric bootstrap equations to 
the basic dynamical principle of the theory. 


\section{Discussion and conclusions}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

In this paper we have formulated a new geometric approach to the Liouville theory.
Although the conformal properties and the spectra of conformal weights
are identical to those of the DOZZ approach 
the spaces of states and the factorization properties are essentially different. 

Whether the geometric bootstrap equations provide a plausible alternative to the DOZZ theory 
depends at the first place on 
the existence of their consistent solutions. 
Due to the complicated non-linear nature of the equations a direct analysis of this problem
is prohibitively difficult. It seems that the only strategy available is to construct a
candidate for the structure constants and then to verify whether it satisfies
the geometric bootstrap equations. 

The simplest possibility is to consider the DOZZ structure constant. 
This proposal might be motivated by the analytic continuation of the 3-point 
function from the weak to the strong coupling region and from the elliptic to
the hyperbolic weights. However we are not aware  of any argument in favor of the hypothesis 
that the structure constants solving the geometric bootstrap equations should admit
an analytic continuation to the weak coupling regime. Still verification of this 
proposal is a well posed problem worth further investigations.

The second possible way to find the structure constants is to analyze a path integral
representation of the 3-point function. It requires an appropriate
generalization of the Liouville 
action of the geometric approach from the conical and the puncture singularities to finite
holes. It involves in particular the open problem
of auxiliary parameters
and Polyakov's conjecture in the case of hyperbolic singularities. 
This topic seems to be especially interesting as it would provide a way for 
the semi-classical analysis of the theory by methods analogous to that 
developed by L.\ Takhtajan in the case of the puncture singularities.


Even if the structure constants were known, the verification of the
geometric bootstrap equations would still be a challenging task.
First of all the equations involve the lengths of closed geodesics in each
channel as functions of the locations of punctures. Up to our knowledge
even in the simplest case 
of 4-punctured sphere such functions are not known in a closed
form \cite{Hempel,Wolf}. Secondly the conformal block  
function is also not known in this case and can be studied only by the
numerical methods developed in  
 \cite{Zamolodchikov:ie,Zam}. Both problems are of their own interest
going beyond the present context. 


Let us finally comment on the problem of consistent interactions of non-critical Nambu-Goto 
string. The results of the present paper lead to the no-go theorem of the following
form. {\it The longitudinal dynamics of the non-critical Nambu-Goto string cannot be described by
any standard, in the sense of BPZ, conformal field theory with neither discrete nor continuous spectrum.}
This reduces the problem of non-critical string to the problem of existence of the Liouville
theory based on the geometric bootstrap equation.
