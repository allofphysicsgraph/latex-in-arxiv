\begin{quote}
We find a nonsupersymmetric 
dilatonic deformation of $AdS_5$ geometry as
an exact nonsingular solution of the type IIB supergravity. 
The dual gauge theory has 
%two phases in which the couplings of Yang-Mills theories differ from
%each othe% 
a different Yang-Mills coupling in each of the two halves of the
boundary spacetime divided by a codimension one defect. We discuss  
%the detailed shape of the geometry%
the geometry of our solution in detail, emphasizing the structure of
the boundary, and also study the string configurations corresponding
to Wilson loops. We also show that the background  is stable under
small scalar perturbations.
