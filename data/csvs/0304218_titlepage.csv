{\bf Abstract}\\
Field theoretic models possessing a global internal fermionic shift symmetry are considered. When such a symmetry is realized locally, spin 3/2 fields appear naturally  as gauge fields. Implementation of the gauging procedure requires not only the usual replacement of ordinary derivatives by covariant derivatives containing the spin 3/2 fields, but also the inclusion of additional monomials. 
The Higgs mechanism and the high energy Nambu-Goldstone fermion equivalence theorem are 
explicitly demonstrated.
