\item
One can study  solutions to  SFT equation of motion
\begin{equation}
\label{SFTEOM} QA+A*A=0
\end{equation}
perturbatively, specifying some  initial data.  This way has
been followed in the background approach to scattering theory in
SFT in \cite{AMZ-PL} as well as in  Sen's paper \cite{0207105}.
\item
One can also study a tachyon dynamics within the level truncation
scheme. As it has been noted in \cite{0207107} there are many
similarities  between the tachyon equation of motion obtained in
SFT via the level truncation and the p-adic string equation of
motion \cite{VVZ,FO,BFOW}.

\item
Solution of (\ref{p=3}) interpolating between two vacua is given
by a monotonic function $\Psi_0$ presented in Fig.\ref{f12}a.
\item Solution of (\ref{Psi-ap2}) for $q^2\leq q_{cr}^2=1.38$ is
given by a  function $\Psi $  interpolating between two vacua
(see Fig.\ref{f12}b). This function oscillates near $\Psi_0$ with
exponentially decreasing amplitude.
\item
Function $\Psi$ solving the system (\ref{seq}) for $q^2\leq
q_{cr}^2=2.2$ is an odd function with a jump at $t=0$ and
$\Psi(\pm \infty)=\mp1.$ $\Upsilon$  is even function. In
Fig.\ref{f3}a these functions for $q^2\simeq 0.96$ are presented.
\item The smoothed functions $\upsilon$ and $\psi$, defined by (\ref{til}),
are continuous, see Fig.\ref{f3}b.
\item For $q^2\simeq 0.96$ function $\psi$ (\ref{psi-Psi})
does not differ much from the function obtained from the solution
of (\ref{Psi-ap2}), by the same formula (\ref{psi-Psi}) $\psi
_{app}=C_{1/8}\Psi _{app}$  (see Fig.\ref{f5}).
