\item{D-branes are hypersurfaces on which open strings can end. Their
dynamics  is described in general by a (supersymmetric) gauge theory
at low energy, this being the low energy spectrum of the corresponding
open strings.}
\item{D-branes are non-perturbative states of the closed string
spectrum (their tension going as $1/g_s$ where $g_s$ is the string
coupling) and at low energy they are described by soliton-like
solutions of the corresponding supergravity theory.}

\item{The dual supergravity solution of a non-conformal gauge theory
does not display an AdS-like geometry. This means that, strictly
speaking, holography is not at work in these cases, in general. What
one can do, at best, is to use what one learned in the conformal case
as a guiding principle but one cannot safely rely on all theorems that
proved  so fruitful in the original AdS/CFT duality.}
\item{In general, the supergravity backgrounds one finds are
singular. To give a meaning to the solution one has of course to cure
the singularity and look for a singularity-free solution. At the same
time one should understand what the r\^ole of the singularity is from
the gauge theory point of view, as well as the meaning of its
resolution. Hence, more than being a problem, this can be a source of
interest after all. We will learn much more about this.}
\item{As already pointed out, a basic aspect of the original AdS/CFT
correspondence is the decoupling between open and closed degrees of
freedom, this being the starting point to state the exact duality. The
duality can be stated at different levels (see Insert 1) and in
general  relates a given regime of the ${\cal N}=4$ gauge theory to a
given regime  of type IIB string theory on ${\rm AdS}_5 \times
S^5$. In particular, there  exists a limit in the parameter space
(i.e. the large 't-Hooft coupling limit, $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$)
where the gauge theory is supposed just to be dual to supergravity,
without any addition of string states (this is actually the regime
where the  duality as been mostly checked). In non-conformal cases it
turns out this is not the case. Roughly speaking, if one insists in
retaining just supergravity modes, the dual gauge theory cannot be
completely decoupled from the bulk. The way this manifests is very
much case-dependent, in particular there is a qualitative difference
between the ${\cal N}=2$ and the ${\cal N}=1$ cases, as we shall see
in detail during these lectures. But it is a fact that within the
supergravity regime (which is the one we will mainly investigate) a
complete decoupling does not hold.}
