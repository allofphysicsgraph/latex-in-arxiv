We propose a new variant of the Hamiltonian reduction for constructing  $n$--particle (super)conformal
theories in one dimension starting from a direct sum of $(n-1)n/2+1$ (super)conformal
mechanics.  As an application we explicitly build
$N=4$ superconformal Calogero--type models both in superfields and in components.
