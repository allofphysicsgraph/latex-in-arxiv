\begin{abstract}
We develop a matrix model to describe bilayered quantum Hall
fluids for a series of filling factors. Considering two coupling
layers, and starting from a corresponding action, we construct its
vacuum configuration at $\nu=q_iK_{ij}^{-1}q_j$, where $K_{ij}$ is
a $2\times 2$ matrix and $q_i$ is a vector. Our model allows us to
reproduce several well-known wave functions. We show that the wave
function $\Psi_{(m,m,n)}$ constructed years ago by Yoshioka,
MacDonald and Girvin 
for the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling factor 
${2\over m+n}$ and in particular
$\Psi_{(3,3,1)}$ at filling ${1\over 2}$ can be obtained from our vacuum
configuration. The unpolarized Halperin wave function 
and especially that for the fractional quantum Hall
state at filling factor ${2\over 5}$ can also be recovered from
our approach. Generalization to more than $2$ layers is
straightforward.
