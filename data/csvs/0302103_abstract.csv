In a recent paper by Johan Hansson it is claimed that the
non-appearance of quarks and gluons as physical particles
is an automatic result of the nonabelian nature of the
color interaction in quantum chromodynamics.
It is shown that the arguments given by Hansson are insufficient to
support his claim by giving simple counter arguments.
