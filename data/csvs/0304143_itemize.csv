The harmonic function rule can be used only to construct
supergravity solutions for intersecting $p$-brane systems which are 
smeared along the relative transverse directions (those which 
are tangent to atleast one but not all of the constituent branes).
 As a result, the metric is then independent
of these coordinates and is a function only of the 
overall transverse directions, which are not tangent to 
the world-volume of any brane in the system.
\"
2,"\begin{itemize}
\item
Secondly, since these supergravity solutions are governed by harmonic 
functions of
the radial coordinate in the transverse space, this (overall) 
transverse space must be at least 
three dimensional if the harmonic functions are to decay at infinity.

Lastly, it is useful also to remember that the only configurations to which 
the rule is
expected to be applicable are those for which the Chern-Simons contribution 
to the 
equation of motion for the four-form vanishes, i.e $F \wedge F = 0.$

{\bf \sf \underline{The Metric}}\\
Assigning a harmonic function $H_a$ to each constituent
M-brane, we proceed to construct the metric for a multi-brane
configuration by taking our cue from the metric for a single brane. 
In analogy to that case, directions tangent to the
$i^{th}$ M5-brane are multiplied by a factor of $H_i^{-1/3}$ whereas 
directions transverse to it are multiplied by $H_i^{2/3}$.

Similarly, a metric describing the background created by a system
of intersecting membranes, can be constructed by ensuring that 
the coordinates along the worldvolume of the $j^{th}$ M2-brane
carry a factor of $H_j^{-2/3}$ while transverse coordinates are multiplied by 
$H_j^{1/3}$.
\item
{\bf \sf \underline{The Field Strength}}\\

Since the field strength components due to each constituent M-brane 
carry different indices, the field strength of the intersecting brane
configuration can be obtained merely by adding the individual field 
strengths corresponding to each M-brane.
\"
5,"\begin{itemize}
\item
Comparing this metric to that of a flat M-brane, we see one major
difference. The metric for a wrapped brane too, depends only
on the radial coordinate $r$ in the space transverse to the brane but 
because of the non-trivial worldvolume of this brane
the transverse space is not as simple to define as it was earlier. We 
know that the transverse space now is some combination of what we call 
the relative transverse (or embedding space) directions and the 
overall transverse directions, but a more
exact statement is hard to make, unless we know explicitly the geometry of the 
worldvolume. \\

Depending on how the supersymmetric cycle lies in the 
relative transverse/embedding manifold, it could ofcourse happen that 
$r$ does not depend on all the coordinates in this space. But in order to 
cover all possible cases and for the purposes of making a general ansatz, we 
assume $r$ is a function of all but the overall common
directions.
\item
The Hermitean metric in the above ansatz will have, in general, 
off diagonal components as well. As will be shown later in an explicit 
example, it is these components of the metric which 
allow us to move from a supergravity solution with a smeared intersection 
to one which has a localised intersection. It also allows us to incorporate 
configurations of branes intersecting at angles -- a class of systems not
encompassed by the harmonic function rule
\item
Allowing $r$ to depend on the 
embedding space coordinates has another 
implication also. For supergravity solutions 
constructed via the harmonic function rule, the field strength 
$F_{p + 2} = d A_{p+1}$ 
consisted only of components obtained from the gauge potential by acting $d$ 
in the overall transverse directions, as these were the only ones on which the 
metric was allowed to depend.\\ 

Using the Fayyazuddin-Smith ansatz instead, where the fields are allowed 
to depend on the relative transverse directions as well, we can now apply 
the exterior derivative in these transverse directions also, leading to
previously unknown components for the field strength! 
\item
Moreover, by allowing $r$ to depend on the embedding space coordinates, we 
get rid of the
objection which the harmonic function rule levelled at brane configurations 
with less
than three overall transverse directions. Such configurations too, are
 welcomed into the 
fold of this new ansatz.

In a Calabi-Yau $n$-fold, 
the $2p$-forms $\phi = \frac{1}{p!} \omega^p$

A Calabi-Yau $n$-fold admits a unique nowhere vanishing ($n,0$)-form,

In seven dimensional manifolds, there is a 3-form $\psi$ (and its dual

these give rise to three and four dimensional calibrations known as

Similarly, in eight dimensional manifolds, there is a
