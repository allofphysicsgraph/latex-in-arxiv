A group $\Gamma \subset GL(n;\IC)$ acting on $\IC^n$
is a {\bf reflection group} if it is generated by elements
$g$ which fix a hyperplane in $\IC^n$, i.e., the eigenvalues of
$g$ are 1 of multiplicity $n-1$ together with $\omega_{k\ge 2}$, some
root of unity. The complement thereof, i.e., a group which does not
contain any reflections is called a {\bf small group}.
