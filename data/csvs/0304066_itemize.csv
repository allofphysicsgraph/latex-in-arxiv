\item We conclude that the correct effective operator is the local
boundary operator of ref.~\cite{Finn01}, which describes how the
vacuum polarization alters the interaction between a test charge
and the surface charges which it induces on the conductor.
%
\item As the matching calculation shows explicitly, this effect
relies on polarizations of the vacuum charge over distances of
order $1/m$, and so presupposes that the conductor's boundaries
are sharp on these scales. As such they are likely to be dominated
by surface effects for real conductors, for which the scale of
penetration depths for electromagnetic fields are set by much
larger interatomic separations, of order $1/(\alpha \, m)$.
