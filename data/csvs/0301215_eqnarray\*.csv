Notice that linearity of this relation implies in particular $W_{xy,0}
= W_{x,y}$.Moreover, when $Oc(G)$ is commutative, \ie $xy=yx$, we
have $W_{x,y}= W_{y,x}$ (but the later equality does not imply the
former).

 From the toric matrices $W_{xy}$ describing the
bimodule structure of $Oc(G)$, one obtains the corresponding twisted
partition functions as sesquilinear forms in the complex vector space 
$\mathbb{C}^s$.
Introducing a basis $\chi$ of vectors $(\chi_{j})$, usually interpreted
as characters, we write
$$Z_{x,y} = \overline{\chi} W_{x,y} \chi$$ and $Z_x = Z_{x,\underline{0}}$.
The modular invariant
partition function is $Z_{\underline{0}}$ with $\underline{0} = 0
\otimesdot 0$.  The example of $E_{6}$ is discussed in section
\ref{section: example E6}.


\subsection{Modular aspects: $S$, $T$ and $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$}


\subsubsection{The $S$ operator}
\label{sec:SfromMul}

Any finite subgroup of $SU(2)$ can be associated with an affine ADE
graph, in such a way that the normalized Perron Frobenius vector of
the graph gives the list of dimensions for irreducible representations
of the finite subgroup.  This observation, known as McKay
correspondence, was later generalized by observing that the whole
table of characters of a finite subgroup of $SU(2)$ can be identified
with the list of eigenvectors (properly normalized) of the adjacency
matrix of the corresponding affine Dynkin diagram (generalized McKay
correspondence).  For any finite group, not necessarily a subgroup of
$SU(2)$, the commutative and associative algebra generated by
irreducible characters (multiplication of representations) can be
realized by a set of commuting matrices (the analogue of our matrices
$G_a$ ) and the table of characters can be reconstructed, without
using the notion of conjugacy classes, by diagonalizing simultaneously
this set of (commuting) matrices: the character table $S$ is a
properly normalized diagonalizing matrix. The following ``quantum
construction'' is analogous.


In the quantum case (\ie diagrams ADE), there is no group, there are
no conjugacy classes and no table of characters.  Nevertheless, there
is an adjacency matrix for the chosen diagram.  The matrix $S$ that we
are looking for is precisely the quantum analogue of the table of
characters, and is obtained, for each level $k$ as the (properly
normalized) table of eigenvectors for the adjacency matrix of the
diagram ${\mathcal A}_{k}$.  The bonus in the quantum situation is
that one can interpret $S$ as one of the generators of the modular
group in a particular representation; this representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ appeared in
a work by Hurwitz \cite{Hurwitz} about a century ago.  $S$, interpreted as
a quantum table of characters (or a ``quantum Fourier transform'')
implements therefore a quantum analogue of the McKay correspondence.
For illustration, the modular matrix $S$ for the $A_{11}$ diagram is
determined in this way in section \ref{sec:SforA11}.  The general expression
for $S=s$, in the case of the $SU(2)$ system, with $\kappa =
k+2$, is
$$S_{ij} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\kappa}} \sin(\pi
\frac{(i+1)(j+1)}{\kappa}) \, \textstyle{for} \,  0 \leq i,j \leq \kappa-2 $$

\subsubsection{$SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$}

A projective representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ can be defined with two
matrices $s$ and $t$ and a phase $\zeta$ which are such that
$(st)^{3}= \zeta^{3} s^{2}$, $s^{2}= C$, $Ct=tC$ and $C^{2}=1$.  The
matrix $C$ is called ``conjugation matrix'' and $t$ is the ``modular
twist''.  Such representations of the modular group can be obtained on
the space generated by the simple objects in any braided modular
category \cite{KiriOsBook}.  The general formula for the modular
phase is $\zeta = e^{2 \mathsf{i} \pi c/24}$ with $c = (\kappa - N) d/\kappa$.
In the present context, \ie generalized Coxeter - Dynkin diagrams of
type $SU(N)$, $\kappa$ is the altitude (generalized Coxeter), $\kappa
- N = k$ is the level and $d = dim\, SU(N)$.  Therefore $c =
\frac{3k}{k+2}$ for $SU(2)$ and $c = \frac{8k}{k+3}$ for $SU(3)$.  The
modular phase $\zeta$ is then equal to $e^{\frac{i\pi}{4}} e^{\frac{
-i \pi} {2\kappa}}$ for an $ADE$ diagram and to $e^\frac{2 i
\pi}{3} e^{-\frac{2 i \pi}{\kappa}}$ for a Di Francesco - Zuber
diagram.  We use modular generators $S,T$ normalized as follows: $S =
s$ and $T = t / \zeta $.  The $SL(2,Z)$ relations then read
$(S T )^{3}=  S^{2}$, $S^{2}= 1$.



\subsubsection{The $T$ operator}
\label{sec:TgeneratorAff}
In the framework of modular categories, and for a Lie algebra
${\mathcal G}$, a general expression for the modular twist is $ t_{ij}
= \delta_{ij} \mathbf{q}^{<<j, j + 2 \rho>>}$ where $\mathbf{q} =
e^{\mathsf{i}\pi/\kappa}$, $\rho$ is half the sum of positive roots,
$i$, $j$ are elements of the weight lattice characterizing the
representation $\tau_{i}$ and $\tau_{j}$; moreover $<<.,.>>$ is an
invariant bilinear form on $\mathcal G$ normalized by
$<<\alpha,\alpha>>=2$ for a short root $\alpha$.  For $SU(2)$, with
$i,j = 0 \ldots \kappa -2$, the modular twist is $t_{ij} =
e^{\frac{\mathsf{i} \pi}{2\kappa} j(j+2)} \delta_{ij}$.  Its logarithm
is proportional to the Casimir operator: $j$ is related with the
(would be) spin $\ell$ by $j+1 = 2\ell +1$, therefore
${\frac{\mathsf{i} \pi}{2\kappa} j(j+2)} = {\frac{2 \mathsf{i}
\pi}{\kappa} \ell(\ell+1)}$.  With our normalization, 
the modular generator $T$ is therefore
$$T_{ij} = exp[2 \mathsf{i}\pi (\frac{(j+1)^2}{4
\kappa} - \frac{1}{8})] \delta_{ij} $$
The expression $(\frac{(j+1)^2}{4 \kappa} - \frac{1}{8})$ is the
``modular anomaly'', and it is convenient to call ``modular exponent''
the quantity $\hat T = (j+1)^{2}$ mod $4\kappa$ (we could as well use
$j(j+2)$ mod $4\kappa$ or any other expression differing by a constant
shift).


In the case of $SU(3)$, the action of the modular matrix $T$ on
vertices $\tau_{j} \equiv \tau_{(j_{1}, j_{2})}$ of ${\mathcal
A}_{k}$ is also diagonal and given by:
$$
\left( T \right)_{i j} = e_{\kappa} \left[ -(i_1+1)^2 -
(i_1+1).(i_2+1) - (i_2+1)^2 + \kappa \right]
\delta_{i j},
$$
where $i \doteq (i_1,i_2)$, $j \doteq
(j_1,j_2)$, $e_{\kappa}[x] \doteq \exp \left( \frac{-2 \mathsf{i} \pi
x}{3\kappa} \right)$, and $\kappa=k +3$.  We call ``modular exponent''
the quantity $\hat{T} = [-(i_1+1)^2 - (i_1+1).(i_2+1)
- (i_2+1)^2 + \kappa ] \, \textstyle{mod} \, 3 \kappa$.


\subsubsection{Modular invariance}

Modular invariance of the partition function $Z_{00}$ can be proven
either by checking that it is invariant when we replace the modular
parameter $\tau$ by $\tau + 1$ or $-1/\tau$ in the characters
$\chi_{r}$ (these functions are generalized Jacobi's theta functions)
or, much more simply, by showing that the matrix $W_{0}$ commutes with
the generators $S$ and $T$ of the modular group in this
representation.


It can be checked, from the explicit expressions of $S$ and $T$ in the
$SU(2)$ case, that, $T^{8 \kappa} = 1$ when $\kappa$ is odd and $T^{4
\kappa} = 1$ when $\kappa$ is even.  This, by itself, is not enough to
imply the following property, which is nevertheless true, and was
proven more than hundred years ago \cite{Hurwitz}: the Hurwitz --
Verlinde representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ factorizes over the finite
group $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}/8 \kappa \mathbb{Z})$ when $\kappa$ is odd, and
over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}/4 \kappa \mathbb{Z})$ when $\kappa$ is even.  For
instance, $T^{40}=1$ for  $A_{4}$  ($40 = 8 \times 5$), but
$T^{48}=1$ for $A_{11}$ ($48 = 4 \times 12$).



\subsubsection{Determination of $Oc(G)$ from the modular properties of
the diagram $G$}
\label{sec:Ocstruct}
In general an Ocneanu cell system is defined by four graphs -- two
horizontal and two vertical -- satisfying a number of matching
properties (see \cite{Ocneanu:paragroups}, \cite{EvansKawa:book}).
Particularly interesting cell systems are obtained when one chooses
the two horizontal graphs as given by two Dynkin diagrams with the
same Coxeter number.  In the present situation, these two are given by
the same Dynkin diagram $G$ (we write ``Dynkin'' but this graph can be
a member of an higher system).  A priori, the determination of $Oc(G)$
results from the study of the the block structure of ${\mathcal B}G$
for its convolution law.  This, in turns, requires the determination
of the values of all Ocneanu cells for the graph system of type
$(G,G)$, a task that may involve rather long calculations\ldots but if
our only purpose is to determine $Oc(G)$, it is simpler to find a
short cut.  One possibility is to use the fact that we already know,
in many cases, the expression of the modular invariant (as calculated
by \cite{CIZ} for $SU(2)$ and \cite{Gannon} for $SU(3)$); such a
technique was apparently followed by A. Ocneanu himself in his
determination of the irreducible quantum symmetries $x$, also called
``irreducible connections'', associated with a given diagram.
However, if we do not want to use this {\it \/ a priori} knowledge,
there is another technique, which uses modular properties of the
diagram; this was one of the purposes of the article
\cite{CoqueGil:Tmodular}.

The  ${\mathcal A}$ series is always modular: one can define a
representation\footnote{Actually this representation
factors to a finite group.} of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ on the vector space of every diagram
of this class and the operator $T$ is diagonal on the vertices.
Take now $G$ some member of a generalized Dynkin-Coxeter system,
and call $A = {\cal A}(G)$ the corresponding member of the ${\mathcal
A}$ series (same Coxeter number or altitude).
Being a module over the algebra of $A$, there are
induction-restriction maps between $G$ and $A$.
These maps are described by the essential matrices $E_{a}$ or by
matrices $F_{i}$ (see section \ref{sec:EssMat} and 
\cite{Coque:Qtetra}, \cite{CoqueGil:ADE}).
One can try to define
an action of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ on the vector space of $G$ in a way that
should be compatible with those maps, but
this is not necessarily possible. In plain terms: suppose that the vertex
$\sigma$ of $G$ appears both in the branching
rules (restriction map from $A$ to $G$)
of vertices $\tau_p$ and $\tau_q$ of $A$; one could think of defining the
value of the modular generator $T$ on $\sigma$
       either as $T(\tau_p)$ or as $T(\tau_q)$, but
this is ambiguous, unless these two values are equal.
In general, there is only a subset $J$ of the vertices of $G$ for
which $T$ can be defined:
a vertex $\sigma$ will belong to this subset whenever $T$ is constant
along the vertices of $A$ whose restriction
to $G$  contains $\sigma$. The knowledge of this set $J$ allows one,
in the ``simple cases'', to determine
$Oc(G)$, the algebra of quantum symmetries of $G$: the set $J$
generates a particular subalgebra of $G$ and one finds $Oc(G) =
G \otimes_{J} G$.

     \paragraph{Results for the $ADE$ systems}: for diagrams of type
     ${\mathcal A}$, the subalgebra $J$ coincides with the algebra of
     the diagram itself, so that $Oc({\mathcal A})$ is isomorphic with
     ${\mathcal A}$.  For $E_{6}$, the subalgebra $J$, isomorphic with
     $A_{3}$ is generated by the three extremal points, and $Oc(E_{6})
     = E_{6} \otimes_{A_{3}} E_{6}$ has dimension $12$ (notice that
     $\kappa = 12$, as well, but this is an accident).  For $E_{8}$,
     the subalgebra $J$, isomorphic with $A_{2}$ is generated by the
     two extremal points of the long branches , and $Oc(E_{8}) = E_{8}
     \otimes_{A_{2}} E_{8}$ has dimension $32$ (notice that $\kappa =
     30$).  The other cases are more difficult to analyze: $Oc(E_{7}) =
     D_{10} \otimes_{\rho} D_{10}$, where the exceptional twist $\rho$
     can be determined from the modular properties (with respect to
     $T$) of the $A_{17}$ diagram; its dimension is $17$.  The algebra
     of quantum symmetries for a $D_{odd}$ diagram can be written as a
     quotient (using an identification map $\rho$) of the tensor square
     of the associated algebra of type ${\mathcal A}$ (for instance,
     $Oc(D_5) = A_7 \otimes_{\rho(A_7)} A_7$); the Ocneanu graph of
     $D_{2n+1}$ has $4n-1$ vertices.  In some respect, the
     determination of Ocneanu graphs for $D_{even}$ diagrams is more
     difficult; indeed, the algebra of quantum symmetries, in this
     case, is not commutative.  We sketch its construction because the
     result will be used later in our study of the twisted partition
     functions for the Potts model.  Starting from $D_{2n}$, one first
     obtains the induction-restriction rules with respect to the
     corresponding $A$ diagram with the same norm ($A_{4n-3}$) by
     calculating the essential matrices; from these rules and from the
     expression of the modular operator $T$ on $A_{4n-3}$, one
     determines the set $J$.  One finds that $Oc(D_{2n})$ consists of
     two separate components.  The first is given by
     $D_{2n}^{trunc}\otimes_{J^{'}} D_{2n}^{trunc}$, where
     $D_{2n}^{trunc}$ is the vector space corresponding to the
     subdiagram spanned by $\{\sigma_{0}, \sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2},
     \ldots \sigma_{2n-3} \}$, obtained by removing the fork, and $J' =
     \{\sigma_{0}, \sigma_{2}, \ldots \sigma_{2n-4} \}$ is the
     corresponding truncated subset\footnote{We choose the natural
     order to label vertices $\sigma_{a}$ of $D_{2n}$.} of $J$.  The
     second component is a non-commutative $2\times 2$ matrix algebra
     reflecting the indistinguishability of $\sigma_{2n-2}$ and
     $\sigma_{2n-2}^{'}$.  Ambichiral points are associated with the
     $n+1$ vertices of $J$ (\ie $n-1$ for the linear branch and $2$ for
     the fork); the Ocneanu graph of $D_{2n}$ has
     $\frac{(2n-2)(2n-2)}{n-1} + 4 = 4n$ vertices.

Results for the $SU(3)$ system: there is no complete treatment in the
available literature, but several examples have been worked out in
\cite{CoqueGil:Tmodular}.  Because we shall use it later (see section
\ref{sec:w3minimal}) in our study of twisted minimal models of type ${\mathcal
W}_{3}$, we just mention that the Ocneanu graph of the exceptional
${\mathcal E}_{5}$ diagram has $24$ points; both left and right chiral
subgraphs have $12$ points; the ambichiral subalgebra is of dimension
$6$ and the supplementary subspace has also dimension $6$.


\subsection{Characters for affine models}
\label{sec:CharacAff}

Strictly speaking, we do not need to use characters in this paper
since modular properties of the partition functions are to be
discussed in terms of commutation relations between the toric matrices
and the $S,T$ generators of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$.  However, for completeness
sake, and for the reader who wants to check explicitly the results in
terms of invariance, or non invariance, with respect to transformations
$\tau \rightarrow -1/\tau $ and $\tau \rightarrow \tau +1$ (or $\tau
\rightarrow \tau +N$, for $T^{N}$), we remind the definitions of the
characters as functions of $\tau$, for affine models.  Here $\tau$ is
a point in the upper -- half plane and we set $q \doteq e^{2 i \pi
\tau}$.  These characters provide a basis of the vector space
$\mathbb{C}^{n}$, for the defining representation (matrices $N_{i}$) of the
graph algebra of diagrams of type ${\mathcal A}$.  In the case of the
$SU(2)$ system, $k = \kappa - 2$ denotes the level, and for each
vertex $j = 0 \ldots k$ of a diagram $A_{k+1}={\mathcal A}_{k}$, we
set $r = j + 1 \equiv 2 \ell + 1$ and define



\[
\xi_{j}^{(k)} (q)=\frac{\sum\limits_{t=-\infty }^{\infty }\left(
2 \kappa t + r \right) q^{(2  \kappa t + r )^{2}/(4 \kappa)}}{\eta (\tau )}
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A closed form, for this expression, is
$$
\xi_{j}^{(k)} (q) = q^{\frac{{\left( 1 + j  \right) }^2}
           {4\,\left( 2 + k \right) }}\,\frac{
        \left( \left( 1 + j  \right) \,
           \left( 1 + {\theta}(3,
              \left( 1 + j  \right) \,\tau ,q^{2 + k})
             \right)  - \mathsf{i} \,\left( 2 + k \right) \,
           {\theta'}(3,
            \left( 1 + j  \right) \,\tau ,q^{2 + k})
          \right) }{{{\eta}(\tau )}^3}
          $$
          where  $\eta(\tau )$ is the Dedekind eta
          function,
         $\theta[3, u, v]$ is the third elliptic Jacobi theta function, and
              $\theta'[3, u, v]$ is its first derivative with respect to $u$.
More explicitly, these characters read

$$
\xi_{j}^{(k)} (q) = q^
          {-\left( \frac{1}{8} \right)  +
            \frac{{\left( 1 + j  \right) }^2}
             {4\,\left( 2 + k \right) }}\, \frac{
         \left( \sum_{t = -\infty }^{{+}\infty }
            \left( {j } + 1 +
               2\,t\,\left( k + 2 \right)  \right) \,
             {{q}}^
              {t\,\left( j  + 1 +
                  t\,\left( k + 2 \right)  \right) } \right) }
         {\sum_{t = -\infty }^{{+}\infty }
          \left( 1 + 4\,t \right) \,
           {{q}}^{t\,\left( 1 + 2\,t \right) }}
$$


When $\tau \rightarrow i \infty$,
then $\xi_{j}^{(k)} (q) \simeq (j + 1) q^{-\frac{1}{8} +
h}$, with
$h = \frac{(j + 1)^{2}}{4 \kappa}$. The power of $q$ is negative when 
$r = j + 1 <
\sqrt{\kappa /2}$. It is  often convenient to use expressions that are
valid in a neighborhood of infinity, for instance:

Graph $A_{1}$

$$\xi_{0}^{(0)} (q) = 1$$

Graph $A_{2}$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\xi_{0}^{(1)} (q)& = &{q^{-\frac{1}{24}}}(1 + 3\,q + 4\,q^2 + 7\,q^3
+ 13\,q^4 + 19\,q^5 +
        29\,q^6 +\ldots)
        \\
\xi_{1}^{(1)} (q)& = &{q^{\frac{5}{24}}}\,\left( 2 + 2\,q + 6\,q^2 + 8\,q^3 +
        14\,q^4 + 20\,q^5 + 34\,q^6 + \ldots \right)
         \end{eqnarray*}

Graph $A_{3}$
\begin{eqnarray*}
	 \xi_{0}^{(2)} (q)&=&{q^{\frac{- 1}{16}}}({1 + 3\,q + 9\,q^2 + 15\,q^3
+ 30\,q^4 + 54\,q^5 +
        94\,q^6 + \ldots})\\
\xi_{1}^{(2)} (q)&=&q^{\frac{1}{8}}\,\left( 2 + 6\,q + 12\,q^2 + 26\,q^3 +
        48\,q^4 + 84\,q^5 + 146\,q^6 +\ldots \right)\\
\xi_{2}^{(2)} (q)&=&q^{\frac{7}{16}}\,\left( 3 + 4\,q + 12\,q^2 + 21\,q^3 +
        43\,q^4 + 69\,q^5 + 123\,q^6 +\ldots \right)
    \end{eqnarray*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

$SU(3)$ characters have similar expressions, but indices $j$
refer then to a Young frame with two rows.
\noindent
Because of the two existing conventions, $(i,j)$ or $(r,s)$,
for the label of the origin ($0$ or $1$)
it is convenient to set $\chi_{1} \equiv \xi_{0}$, $\chi_{2} \equiv
\xi_{1}$ \, \etc :
$$\chi_{j + 1}^{(k)} \doteq \xi_{j}^{(k)}$$

\section{Torus structures for affine models}

\subsection{Example of an affine model: the $E_{6}$ case}
\label{section: example E6}

Toric matrices $W_{x0}$ have been determined for all $ADE$ cases and a
few others.  Since we shall need them later, we summarize the
situation for $E_{6}$.  We also present, in this case, several results
that were not available before: the full multiplication table of
$Oc(E6)$, the determination of the frustrated partition functions with
two twists, and a discussion of modular properties of these functions.
We also show how to display the expression of these partition
functions in a compact way, by using induction -- restriction rules for
the pair $(A_{11},E_{6})$.

\subsubsection{The $E_{6}$ diagram and its Ocneanu graph (summary)}

Figure \ref{Fig: E6labels} displays $E_{6}$ and the related diagram
$A_{11}$. Vertices $\sigma_{a}$ of $E_{6}$ are
labelled $0,1,2,5,4,3$ as shown on the picture.
$A_{11}$ acts on $E_{6}$, hence $ A_{11}$ also acts from the left and
from the right on the Ocneanu algebra\footnote{This tensor product is
taken above the subalgebra $A_{3}$ generated by vertices $0,4,3$, so
that $a \otimesdot ub = a u\otimesdot b$ when $u \in A_{3}$.} of
quantum symmetries which can be shown to be equal (\cite
{Coque:Qtetra}, \cite{CoqueGil:ADE}) to $Oc(E_{6}) =
E_{6} \otimes_{A_{3}} E_{6}$. It has dimension $12$.

The bimodule structure of $Oc(E_{6})$ over $A_{11}$ is encoded by $12
\times 12 = 144 $ matrices $W_{xy}$ of dimension $ 11 \times 11$, (as
we shall see, many of them are equal).  In particular one obtains the
$12$ matrices $W_{x} \doteq W_{x0}$, one for each point of the Ocneanu
graph, and the matrix $W_{0} \doteq 0 \otimesdot_{A_{3}} 0$ associated
with the origin $\underline 0$.  Figure \ref{Fig: Oc(E6)} displays the
Ocneanu graph and the matrix $W_{0}$.  Continuous and dashed lines on
this graph describe respectively the multiplications by the left and
right chiral generators $\underline 1 = 1 \otimesdot 0$, $\underline
1' = 0 \otimesdot 1$.  We use the notations $\underline a = a
\otimesdot 0$, $\underline a' = 0 \otimesdot a$ and $\underline{ab'}
\equiv {\underline a} \, {\underline b'} \equiv a \otimesdot b$.
There are many identities hidden in this graph, like for instance
$\underline{31'}=\underline{2'}$; to see them, the reader should work
out for himself the multiplication table of the graph algebra of
$E_{6}$ or refer to references \cite{Coque:Qtetra} or
\cite{CoqueGil:ADE}.
