\item The machinery developed here may be applicable more generally, e.g. to charged black holes in $d>4$,
and perhaps even to general rotating black holes.  Some work in this direction is in progress for the Kerr
black hole in $d=4$ \cite{inprog}.
In addition one could consider the case of black holes 
in de Sitter or anti-de Sitter space; quasinormal frequencies in these backgrounds have recently been
studied \cite{berti2,musiri}, and recently some exact results have been obtained in
the limit where the Schwarzschild horizon nearly coincides with the de Sitter horizon \cite{cardoso2}.
The asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in these backgrounds may be related to properties of
the holographic dual theory \cite{horowitz, birmingham}.  The method will however require some
modification, since the potential no longer vanishes at infinity, and the expected answer is quite
different (the real part is expected to diverge along with the imaginary part \cite{berti2, horowitz}.)

\item Our results so far only give the asymptotic real part of the frequency in the limit of infinite
imaginary part.  It may be possible to extend the technique to obtain a systematic expansion
including corrections in $1 / \sqrt{\abs{\omega}}$.

\item It would be desirable to have some numerical calculations of the asymptotic quasinormal frequencies in
the cases we considered above, to confirm or reject our proposed analytic solution.  In the case of
Reissner-Nordstr\o{}m there are some results \cite{andersson3} for the low overtones which seem to support our
result, but it would be good to check directly that this behavior persists in the asymptotic limit.

\item In $d>4$ Schwarzschild we could only give results for certain types of perturbation, because so far
a good theory of more general perturbations in these dimensions is apparently lacking.  It would be nice
to understand how the leading term in the potential depends on the type of perturbation.

\item The authors of \cite{guinn} also applied WKB methods to the calculation of quasinormal frequencies in 
$d=4$ Schwarzschild, but obtained $0$ for
the asymptotic real part.  We believe that the error there arose from an inappropriate analytic continuation
in $\omega$.  Since the potential is quartic there are four turning points, which in the limit of large $\im \omega$ are
the fourth roots of $\omega^2$; the calculation of \cite{guinn} picks out just two of these to
contribute to the transmission amplitude, namely the two which would contribute if $\omega$ were analytically
continued so that the problem looked like the usual WKB barrier penetration.  But the WKB formula is not exact as a function
of $\omega$ even in the usual case; the corrections
which are known to be small in one region can become large when one continues to a different region.  It is 
possible that one can make a correct WKB calculation by including these ``exponentially small'' corrections in some way.
One might then interpret our result \eqref{answer} as coming from a sum over quantum mechanical instantons which run between all possible
pairs of turning points in a symmetrical fashion, just as one can do for the standard WKB formula with two turning points.  In this case the four 
terms $1, e^{4 \pi \omega}, e^{\pi i j}, e^{- \pi i j}$ should be essentially the relevant instanton amplitudes.

\item According to our calculation, the asymptotic real part of the frequency depends 
only on the coefficient of the leading term in the potential.  
This leading term becomes important only near the singularity at $r=0$, but it still affects the
transmission amplitude in the physical region  between the horizon and infinity.  Although the
importance of the singularity at $r=0$ was purely mathematical in our
approach, there could be a more physical explanation of why our procedure
works.  Can we view it as a manifestation of the complementarity principle, reflecting some
kind of duality between what happens inside and outside the horizon?

\item The occurrence of the Hawking temperature for the inner horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr\o{}m
black hole is surprising.  How can the quasinormal modes know about the behavior of the black hole
in the causally disconnected interior?  This mysterious term might have some interpretation
in terms of the chemical potential of the black hole for electric charge \cite{strom-private}.

\item The original motivation for this work was the LQG explanation \cite{dreyer} of the $\log(3)$ 
in $d=4$ Schwarzschild in terms of a spin network
with links of spin 1.  If LQG is correct, perhaps the more complicated
behavior for Reissner-Nordstr\o{}m should have a similar explanation.  The possible appearance
of $\log(2)$ in the asymptotic frequencies could support some recent claims \cite{corichi} that
the gauge group of LQG should be SU(2) despite the $\log(3)$ for Schwarzschild.

\item Similarly, can spin foam models or other models explain the fact that the $\log(3)$ for Schwarzschild black holes
seems to be independent of dimension?
