We compute the $O(\lambda)$ correction to the Casimir
energy for the massive $\lambda\phi^4$ model
confined between a pair of parallel plates. The calculations
are made with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.
The correction is shown to be sensitive to the boundary conditions,
except in the zero mass limit, in which case our results
agree with those found in the literature.
