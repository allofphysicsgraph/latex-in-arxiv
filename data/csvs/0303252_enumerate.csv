\item  Moduli from $B_{ij}$, the second rank antisymmetric tensor
fields.  Here the axion field is,
\begin{equation}
\theta = M_s^2 \int d\Sigma^{ij}B_{ij}.
\end{equation}
These have periods of order $1$ in string units.  Dimensionally
reducing the kinetic term for $B_{ij}$ one finds their
decay constants are:
$${f_a^2 \over M_p^2} = {1 \over (R M_s)^4}.$$

\item  Moduli from $B_{\mu \nu}$ (the model-independent axion).
Decay constant\footnote{Some of the estimates we will present, may
be modified by relatively large factors like $16\pi^2$.  We do not
know of examples where such factors help rather than hinder slow
roll inflation.  At any rate, factors like this could at best give
of order $10^2 $ e-foldings.} :
$${f_a^2 \over M_p^2} = 1.$$
\item  Wilson lines (the types of fields considered in
\cite{nimaetal}):  $A_I$ have periods of order $1/R$ in string
units (if one takes the $X^I$ coordinates to have periodicities of
order $R$);
$${f_a^2 \over M_p^2} = {1 \over (R M_s)^2}.$$
