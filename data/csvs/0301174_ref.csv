As a simple corollary of (\ref{50}), it is possible to relate the star gauge invariant and covariant anomalies in the constant field approximation. The point is that the factor multiplying the determinant in (\ref{50}) is just the star gauge covariant anomaly (\ref{9}). Hence we obtain,
\be
\p_\mu j^{\mu(5)}=  {1\over\sqrt{det(1-\theta  F)} } D_\mu J^{\mu(5)}
\label{cov}

\section{\bf{Seiberg-Witten transformation and integrated anomalies: an alternative derivation; Elliott formula}}

\bigskip

 
It is also possible to provide an alternative  evidence that (\ref{45}), under the Seiberg-Witten transformation, is equivalent to the integrated anomaly in the usual space.  Contrary to the previous approach, the equivalence will be established by directly working with general fields, avoiding the passage through the constant field approximation. Of course for two dimensions the result was already established (see (\ref{34})), directly in general terms, based on the simplification of the noncommutativity parameter. 

Basically, the idea is to  invert the process adopted till now, i.e.; instead of using the inverse map , the usual map will have to be used. However, unlike the inverse map, the map from the noncommutative to the commutative picture is not known in a closed form.  But that is not important because the basic correspondence between the noncommutative and commutative descriptions is known to be given by \cite{sw},
\be
\d F_{\mu\nu}(\t)={1\over 4}\d\t^{\rho\sigma}\Big[2\{F_{\mu\rho}, F_{\nu\sigma}\}_+
-\{A_\rho , D_\sigma F_{\mu\nu} +\p_\sigma F_{\mu\nu} \}_+\Big]
\label{52}
\ee
subjected to the initial condition that for vanishing $\theta$, the noncommutative field tensor reduces to the usual one $(F_{\mu\nu}(\t =0)=f_{\mu\nu})$. The covariant derivative has been defined in (\ref{8}) and the following notation has been introduced,
\be
\{ A, B\}_+= A*B +B*A
\label{53}
\ee
The map (\ref{18}) is just a solution to this equation.  
Let us now study the response of this transformation on the integrated anomalies. As before, the analysis is split into two parts. First, the two dimensional case is considered.

\newpage

\noindent{\it{ The two dimensional example}}:

\bigskip

Under the transformation (\ref{52}), the anomaly (\ref{14}) responds as,
\be
\int \, d^2x (\d \hat A) ={\e^{\mu\nu}\over {2\pi}}\int\,d^2x \, (*)\d\t^{\rho\sigma}\Big(F_{\mu\rho} F_{\nu\sigma}-A_\rho
\p_\sigma F_{\mu\nu} - iA_\rho A_\sigma F_{\mu\nu}\Big)
\label{1.2}
\ee 
where repeated use has been made of the  the associativity of the star product within an integral,
\be
\int \Big(A*B*C\Big)=\int \Big(B*C*A\Big)=\int \Big(C*A*B\Big)
\label{55}
\ee
Up to a divergence term that is discarded, it can be written as,
\ber
\int \, d^2x\,(\d \hat A) &=&{\e^{\mu\nu}\over {2\pi}}\int\,d^2x\, (*)\d\t^{\rho\sigma}\Big(F_{\mu\rho} F_{\nu\sigma}+{1\over 2}
 F_{\mu\nu}F_{\sigma\rho}\Big)\cr
 &=& 0
\label{2.2}
\eer 
with the last line following identically from two dimensional properties. This means there is no $\t$-dependence and the complete expression is equivalent to its initial value obtained by setting $\t=0$. Thus the integrated versions of the invariant anomalies in the two descriptions get mapped, so that,
\be
{\e^{\mu\nu}\over {2\pi}}\int\, d^2x F_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow {\e^{\mu\nu}\over {2\pi}}\int\, d^2x f_{\mu\nu}
\label{3.2}
\ee
which is what we set out to prove, reconfirming our assertion that the noncommutative anomaly is obtained from the usual anomaly through the use of the Seiberg-Witten transformation. Since there is only one component of the field tensor, it can also be expressed as,
\be
\int\,d^2x F \rightarrow \int\,d^2x  f
\label{4.2}\ee

We next discuss higher dimensions. For four dimensions, the result analogous to (\ref{3.2}) is explicitly done which is extended to other higher dimensions by a topological argument.

\bigskip

\noindent{\it{Four dimensional analysis}}:

\bigskip

The response of 
 (\ref{52}) on the four dimensional integrated anomaly (\ref{15}) is given by,
\be
  \int d^4 x  (\d{\hat{\cal A}}) =- {1 \over{8\pi^2}} \e^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \int d^4 x  (\d F_{\mu\nu})* F_{\rho\sigma}
\label{54}
\ee
Using standard manipulations with the star products, we find,
\be
  \int d^4 x  (\d{\hat{\cal A}}) ={1 \over{32\pi^2}}  \e^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \int d^4 x (*) 
  \Big(4(F\d\t F)_{\mu\nu} F_{\rho\sigma}+\d\t^{\a\b}\Big(2A_\a \p_\b(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma})
  +i[A_\a, A_\b] F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}
  \Big)
\label{56}
\ee
where star operations are implied in all products and the notation of (\ref{25}) has been used. 
Up to a boundary term that is discarded, we obtain,
\ber
  \int d^4 x  (\d{\hat{\cal A}})& =&{1 \over{32\pi^2}}  \e^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} \int d^4 x (*) 
  \Big(4(F\d\t F)_{\mu\nu} F_{\rho\sigma}+\d\t^{\a\b}F_{\a\b}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}\Big)\cr
  &=& 0
\label{57}
\eer
where the last equality is a consequence of
 an identity, valid for any pair of second rank antisymmetric tensors,
\be
\int \, d^4x\, (*)\Big(4((ABA) \wedge A) +B^{\a\b}A_{\a\b}(A\wedge A)\Big) = 0
\label{58}
\ee
It is the $n=2$ result of the general identity (\ref{27}); however it is only valid within an integral if the ordinary products are replaced by the star products. This means there is no $\t$-dependence and the integrated versions of the invariant anomalies in the two descriptions get mapped, so that,
\be
-{1\over {16\pi^2}} \int\, d^4x\, (*) (F\wedge F) \rightarrow\, -{1\over {16\pi^2}} \int\, d^4x\, (f\wedge f)
\label{59}
\ee
This concludes the analysis for four dimensions.

It is possible to proceed with other higher dimensions in the same way. However , we note that (\ref{4.2}) and (\ref{59}) yield the topological charges in two and four dimensions in the commutative description. Thus the objects to which these are mapped must represent the topological charges in the noncommutative description. Since for arbitrary dimensions the charges are just given by the wedge extensions in the commutative picture, these should be given by the star wedge extensions in the other picture. Thus the integrated anomalies in the two versions must be mapped by the Seiberg-Witten transformation, so that,
\be
\int\, d^{2n}x (*)(F\wedge F\wedge F .....\wedge F)\rightarrow\int\,d^{2n}x(f\wedge f\wedge f.....\wedge f)
\label{68a}
\ee

There is a subtle point that is next discussed. We have seen that the noncommutative Chern character,
\be
 {\cal C}_{nc}=Tr(*) (e^F)= \int\, (*)
e^F
\label{64}
\ee
is a straightforward generalisation of the commutative version $(\int e^f)$.  But it is known that, in the general case, the noncommutative Chern character is given by the Elliott formula \cite{e, 
hl},
\ber
{\cal C}_E&=& Tr(*) [\sqrt{det(1-\theta  F) } e^{ (F (1-\theta  F)^{-1})}] \cr
            &=&\int dx (*) [\sqrt{det(1-\theta  F) } e^{ (F (1-\theta  F)^{-1})}] 
\label{68b}
\eer
where, for the $U(1)$ case, there is no trace over the group indices. Actually the same formula is also obtained in string theory by a comparison of the Ramond-Ramond couplings  \cite{lm}. It is given here by (\ref{37}). But it was shown there the complete dependence on the $\t$ parameter is contained only in the implicit dependence through the definition of the field tensor.  Thus, setting the explicit $\t =0$, (\ref{68b}) reduces to (\ref{64}), thereby simplifying the Elliott formula,
\be
{\cal C}_E = {\cal C}_{nc}
\label{el}
\ee

The Chern character is known to be both invariant as well as closed. It can therefore be expressed in terms of Chern Simons forms $\Omega$ such that,
\be
\int  (*)(F\wedge F\wedge F .....\wedge F)=\int d\Omega_{2n+1}
\label{cs}
\ee
with,
\be
\Omega_{2n+1}=n\int_0^1dt (*)\Big(A\wedge F_t\wedge F_t............\wedge F_t\Big)
\label{cs1}
\ee
where $F_t=t dA+i t^2 A*A$. Since the integrated anomalies are mapped by the Seiberg-Witten transformation, it is expected that the noncommutative Chern-Simons action would likewise be mapped to the usual Chern-Simons action.  This has been explicitly checked in the three dimensional (n=1) case  in \cite{gs} {\footnote {Note, however, that there are subtleties in this mapping \cite{p} for topologically nontrivial configurations.}}. Also, the structure of the three dimensional Chern-Simons action in noncommutative space, found \cite{gs} by an explicit loop calculation, agrees with (\ref{cs1}).

\section{{Discussions}}

\bigskip

We have proposed an unintegrated form of the  star gauge invariant axial anomaly in a noncommutative gauge theory. It was based on the Seiberg-Witten transformation relating the commutative (usual) and noncomutative descriptions. The precise solutions \cite{hl, oo, ms, lm} that were used were found earlier by string theory calculations based on a study of Ramond ramond couplings in different descriptions. The proposal for the anomaly was shown to be compatible with existing results in the literature. 

The explicit computation of the gauge invariant axial anomaly is known to be complicated by the appearance of non-planar graphs which, by naive considerations, are expected to vanish.   However as discussed in \cite{as, bg,alt, n},  these graphs suffer from the problem of UV/IR mixing. 
A proper treatment shows, that for the integrated version of the invariant anomaly, there is a contribution only from the zero external momentum \cite{as, alt}. This was clearly shown in our analysis. In fact the unintegrated result was obtained by smearing the zero momentum result to an open Wilson line, such that it was a solution of the Seiberg-Witten transformation.

We have clarified several aspects of the integrated anomalies and their relation to the noncommutative Chern character. It is generally thought that the noncommutative Chern character is just a simple star deformation of the usual Chern character. In general it is not true, rather it is given by the Elliott formula \cite{e}, which is also confirmed by string theory calculations 
involving D-branes \cite{lm}.  For trivial topologies a meaningful separation of the trace in the Elliott formula (\ref{68b}), as an integration  over space and a trace over the group indices, is possible. It was also shown that the complicated topological structure simplified  into the standard star deformation of the commutative Chern character. Expectedly, the Chern-Simons forms followed from this character.

In the constant field approximation, the unintegrated invariant and covariant anomalies were shown to be proportional, with a field dependent normalisation (\ref{cov}). It was reassuring to note that the integrated versions became identical, both yielding the expected Chern character.

A consequence of this analysis was that the integrated noncommutative anomalies were mapped to the corresponding usual integrated anomalies by the Seiberg-Witten equation. This was shown in two distinct ways; once by starting from the usual axial anomaly and using the solutions of the 
equation, then by taking the noncommutative version and using the basic transformation itself.
Since the solutions of the map are not unique \cite{ak}, it appears that those found naturally from string theory might have a special status {\footnote {Such a possibility was raised in footnote 4 of \cite{oo}.}},  since it correctly led to  the integrated noncommutative anomalies from the usual ones.

It is also possible to obtain the chiral anomalies, in analogue of what was done for the usual case \cite{rb}. Consider, for instance a chiral theory, where the Dirac operator in (\ref{0}) is replaced as,
\be
D_\mu\s=\p_\mu\s +i P_+A_\mu*\s; \,\,\, P_+={{1+\gamma_5}\over 2}
\label{d1}
\ee
while the classically conserved chiral gauge invariant current is given by, 
\be
 j^{\mu(R)}=\bs *\g^\mu P_+\s
 \label{d2}
 \ee
 Taking the vacuum expectation value, we find,
 \be
 < j^{\mu(R)}> = Tr\Big(\g^\mu P_+(*) <X|(\g^\mu(P_\mu +P_+ A_\mu))^{-1}|X>\Big)
 \label{d3}
 \ee
 where the expression has been written in the $(X, P)$ basis and star products are implied in the expansion of the inverse propagator. Noting that $P_+$ is a projection operator, this simplifies to,
 \be
 < j^{\mu(R)}> = Tr\Big(\g^\mu P_+(*) <X|(\g^\mu(P_\mu + A_\mu))^{-1}|X>\Big)
 \label{d4}
 \ee
 implying that the chiral current can be interpreted as comprising two pieces, a vector and an axial vector current, both defined  in a vector gauge theory. Using a vector gauge invariant regularisation, the anomaly in the first part is zero. The other part is just half of the axial anomaly, whose form has been proposed here. Thus the chiral anomaly is obtained.
 
 There are several directions in which the present work may be extended. One possibility is to study the structure of anomalous commutators in noncommutative theories. These are connected to divergence anomalies by a set of consistency relations \cite{b}, which were exploited in the usual case \cite{bg1}. A knowledge of the unintegrated anomalies is essential which has been provided here. Also, the role of the Seiberg-Witten transformation in the study of commutator anomalies is relevant. Our proposal for the gauge invariant anomaly could be tested for spaces other than ${\bf R^{2n}}$, as for instance in the case of the fuzzy sphere. The usual problems of calculating the unintegrated star gauge invariant anomaly persist there and recourse is taken to the gauge covariant anomaly \cite{asn}.  Our work can have implications in formulating the standard model on noncommutative spaces \cite{w}.  Such models are generally studied by converting the original noncommutative theory to an effective theory in the usual space, by using the Seiberg-Witten map. The fact that the anomalies get identified in the different descriptions, through this map, supports the construction of such an effective theory.
