The $\gamma$-trace anomaly of supersymmetry
current in a supersymmetric gauge theory  shares a
superconformal anomaly multiplet with the  chiral $R$-symmetry anomaly
and the Weyl anomaly, and its holographic reproduction is a
valuable test to the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture.
We investigate how the $\gamma$-trace anomaly of the supersymmetry
current of ${\cal N}=1$ four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory
in an ${\cal N}=1$ conformal supergravity background
can be extracted out from the ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity
in five dimensions.
It is shown that the reproduction of this super-Weyl anomaly
 originates from the following two facts: First the ${\cal N}=2$
bulk supersymmetry transformation converts into ${\cal N}=1$
superconformal transformation on the boundary, which consists of
${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry transformation and
special conformal supersymmetry (or super-Weyl) transformation;
second the supersymmetry variation of the bulk action
 of five-dimensional gauged supergravity is a total derivative.
  The non-compatibility
 of supersymmetry and  the super-Weyl transformation invariance yields
 the holographic supersymmetry current anomaly. Furthermore, we speculate
on that the contribution from the external gauge field
to the holographic superconformal anomaly is dominated by the leading
terms in the asymptotic expansion of the bulk fields in terms of
the radial coordinate, while external gravitational background
contribution is determined by those terms with logarithmic function
dependence on the radial coordinate.
