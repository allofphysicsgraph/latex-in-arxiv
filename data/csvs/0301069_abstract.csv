	We investigate dynamics of the homogeneous
time-dependent SU(2) Yang-Mills fields governed by the non-Abelian
Born-Infeld lagrangian which arises in superstring theory as a
result of summation of all orders in the string slope parameter
$\alpha'$. It is shown that generically the Born-Infeld dynamics
is less chaotic than that in the ordinary Yang-Mills theory, and
at high enough field strength the Yang-Mills chaos is stabilized.
More generally, a smothering effect of the string non-locality on
behavior of classical fields is conjectured.
