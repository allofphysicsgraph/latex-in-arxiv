Figure 1. A solution in GR with horizon size $r_h=20$, in Planck units. A) An infinite slope appears in $B(r)$ at the crossing $r_{*}$ where $1/A(r)$ changes sign. B) The nonsmooth behavior of $\rho(r)$ at the crossing is barely evident. C) A curvature invariant is compared to the same quantity for the Schd solution (in green). D) The region around the crossing point in (C) is enlarged.

Figure 2. Another solution in GR with horizon size $r_h=20$, differing from Fig.~(1) by having much smaller $\rho$ and $p$.

Figure 3. A solution in the $2+4$ derivative theory of gravity with horizon size $r_h=20$, in Planck units. A) The metric functions (numerical problems are evident). B) The region around the crossing point is enlarged. C) $\rho(r)$ remains positive and it and its first derivative are continuous, unlike GR. D) The scalar curvature is continuous and finite, as in GR.
