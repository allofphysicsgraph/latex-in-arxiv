    Continuing on our previous work, we consider a class of higher dimensional
    brane models with the topology of $AdS_{D_1+1} \times \Sigma$, where
    $\Sigma$ is a one-parameter compact manifold and two branes of codimension one
    are located at the orbifold fixed points. We consider a set-up where 
    such a
    solution arises from Einstein-Yang-Mills theory and evaluate the one-loop
    effective potential induced by gauge fields and by a generic bulk
    scalar field.
    We show that this type of brane models resolves the gauge hierarchy between
    the Planck and electroweak scales through redshift effects due to the warp
    factor $a=e^{-\pi kr}$. The value of $a$ is then fixed by minimizing
    the effective potential.  We find that, as in the Randall Sundrum case, 
    the gauge field contribution to the effective potential
    stabilises the hierarchy without fine-tuning as long as the laplacian
    $\Delta_\Sigma$ on $\Sigma$ has a zero eigenvalue. Scalar fields can
    stabilise the hierarchy depending on the mass and the non-minimal 
    coupling.  
    We also address the quantum self-consistency of the
    solution, showing that the classical brane solution is not spoiled by
    quantum effects.\\
