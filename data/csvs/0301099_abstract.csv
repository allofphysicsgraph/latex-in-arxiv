We observe a relation between closed strings tachyons and one-loop 
instabilities in non-supersymmetric non-commutative gauge theories.
In particular we analyze the spectra of type IIB string theory on 
$C^3/Z_N$ orbifold singularities and the non-commutative field theory that 
lives on D3 branes located at the singularity. We find a surprising 
correspondence between the existence or not of one-loop low-momentum 
instabilities in the non-commutative field theory and the existence or 
not of tachyons in the closed string twisted sectors. Moreover, the 
relevant piece of the non-commutative field theory effective action is
suggestive of an exchange of closed string modes. This suggests that 
non-commutative field theories retain some information about the dynamics 
of the underlying string configuration. Finally, we also comment on a 
possible relation between closed string tachyon condensation and field 
theory tachyon condensation.
