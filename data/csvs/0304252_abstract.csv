We determine the moduli space of classical solutions to the field
equations of Poisson Sigma Models on arbitrary Riemann surfaces for
Poisson structures with vanishing Poisson form class. This condition
ensures the existence of a presymplectic form on the target Poisson
manifold which agrees with the induced symplectic forms of the Poisson
tensor upon pullback to the leaves. The dimension of the classical
moduli space as a function of the genus of the worldsheet $\S$ and the
corank $k$ of the Poisson tensor is determined as $k \,
(\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}(H^1(\S))+1)$.  Representatives of the classical solutions are
provided using the above mentioned presymplectic 2-forms, and possible
generalizations to cases where such a form does not exist are
discussed. The results are compared to the known moduli space of
classical solutions for two-dimensional BF and Yang--Mills theories.
