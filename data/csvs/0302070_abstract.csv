This article provides a basic introduction to some concepts of non-commutative
geometry. The importance of quantum groups and quantum spaces is stressed.
Canonical non-commutativity is understood as an approximation to the quantum
group case. Non-commutative gauge theory and the non-commutative Standard Model
are formulated on a space-time satisfying canonical non-commutativity relations.
We use $*$-formalism and Seiberg-Witten maps.
