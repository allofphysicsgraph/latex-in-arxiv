{\bf Abstract}
The  obstruction for
a perturbative  reconstruction of the five-dimensional bulk metric 
starting from the four-dimensional metric at the boundary,
that is, the Dirichlet 
problem, is computed in dimensions $6\leq d\leq 10$ and some comments are made 
on its general structure and, in particular, on its relationship 
with the conformal anomaly, which we compute in dimension $d=8$.
