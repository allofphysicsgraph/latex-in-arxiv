\indent \hskip 16pt We present a new Lorentz gauge invariant
$U(1)$ topological field theory in Riemann-Cartan spacetime
manifold $U_{4}$. By virtue of the decomposition theory of $U(1)$
gauge potential and the $ \phi $--mapping topological current
theory, it is proved that the $U(1)$ complex scalar field $\phi
(x)$ can be looked upon as the order parameter field in our
Universe, and the set of zero points of $\phi (x)$ create the
cosmic strings as the spacetime defects in the early Universe. In
the standard cosmology this complex scalar order parameter field
possesses negative pressure, provides an accelerating expansion of
Universe and be able to explain the inflation in the early
Universe. Therefore this complex scalar field is not only the
order parameter field created the cosmic strings, but also
reasonably behaves as the quintessence, the dark energy.
