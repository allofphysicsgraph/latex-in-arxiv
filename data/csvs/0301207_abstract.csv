We have proposed a method in the context of BFFT approach that leads to truncation of
the infinite series regarded to constraints in the extended phase space, as well as
other physical quantities (such as Hamiltonian). This has been done for cases where
the matrix of Poisson brackets among the constraints is symplectic or constant. The
method is applied to Proca model, single self dual chiral bosons and chiral Schwinger
models as examples.
