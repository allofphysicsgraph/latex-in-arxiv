We illustrate the importance of mass scales and their relation in the
specific case of the linear sigma model within the context of its one loop
Ward identities. In the calculation it becomes apparent the delicate and
essential connection between divergent and finite parts of amplitudes. Most
importantly, the examples shows how to use mass scales identities which are
absolutely necessary to manipulate graphs involving several masses in a way
as to show its equivalence to others involving different (than the previous)
masses. Finally we show that in the context of the Implicitly Regularization
all infinite parts can and should be written in terms of a single scale
which is the renormalization group scale. This facilitates, e.g., obtaining
symmetric counterterms and immediately lead to the proper definition of
Renormalization Group Constants.
