If $C(X)$ are $p$-forms, dynamical fields and
nontrivial dynamical equations are associated
with $H^{p}$ and $H^{p+1} (\gs_-)$, respectively.

Suppose that the symmetry algebra $g$
admits a triple $Z$ graded structure
$g = g_0 \oplus g_- \oplus g_+$ with Abelian subalgebras $g_\pm$. Let
$\gs_- = dX^A P_A$ where $P_A$ is some basis in $g_-$.
The dynamical fields satisfying
$\gs_- (C)=0$ then identify with the
primary fields in $C(X)$ satisfying $P_A C(X)=0$.\footnote{Note
the roles of ``translations"" $P_A$
and ``special conformal"" generators $K^A$ of $g_+$ acting in the
fiber is exchanged  in the unfolded formulation
compared to the standard induced representation
approach~\cite{ind} in which primaries are defined directly in
 the base manifold.} In other words, $H^0 (\gs_-)$
consists of singular vectors (i.e., vacua) of various submodules
over $g$ in $V$, which is consistent since any invariant submodule
of $V$ gives rise to a subsystem in (\ref{geneq}).
$H^0 (\gs_-)$
forms some representation of $g_0$. In most interesting physical
applications $H^0 (\gs_-)$ decomposes into (may be infinite)
direct sum of finite-dimensional representations of $g_0$.
This corresponds to a model with dynamical fields carrying
finite dimensional representations of $g_0$. Note that
for the case of usual conformal algebra, $g_0$ consists of
the Lorentz algebra plus dilatations, i.e., dynamical fields are
some Lorentz tensors carrying definite conformal weights.

%\item
Suppose that $V_{1,2}=V_1\otimes V_2$. Let $ C_1(X)\in V_1$
and $ C_2 (X)\in V_2$ solve (\ref{geneq}) with some operators
$ \gs^1_{-}$ and $ \gs^2_{-}$. Then
\be
\label{CCC}
C_{1,2} (X) = C_1 (X)\otimes C_2 (X)
\ee
solves (\ref{geneq}) with
$
\gs^{1,2}_{-} = \gs^1_- \otimes Id +Id\otimes \gs^2_-.
$
 If $V_1$ and $V_2$ form modules
over some symmetry algebra $g$, the same is true for $V_{1,2}$.
As a result, the unfolded formulation of the dynamical equations
equips the variety of solutions of
$g$-quasiinvariant partial differential
equations with the natural associative product structure isomorphic
to the tensor algebra of (semiinfinite)
modules over $g$. Note that this associative
structure differs from that of the ring of solutions
of first order differential equations. It maps solutions of
some set of (not necessarily first order) $g$-quasiinvariant
partial differential equations to solutions of some other
$g$-quasiinvariant equations. In fact, this property is deeply
related to the general $AdS/CFT$ philosophy~\cite{GV}.
