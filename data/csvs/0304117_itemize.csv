\item[(a)] For $\zetat_1 \neq 0$ one has $K_1(\rho) =0$ with $k_0(\rho) = 
\frac{\zetat_1}{\zeta_1} \rho^p$. The matter extended system remains 
strictly renormalizable at one loop.
\item[(b)] For $\zetat_1 =0$ one can achieve 
$k_0(\rho) \sim \rho^p,\,p \neq 0$, only by taking $K_1(\rho) = - \zeta_1 
\rho^{-p}$. Thus already at the 1-loop level standard 
renormalizability cannot be maintained.

\item[(a)] For 4D scalar matter corresponding 
to a $\Gt/\Ht$ sigma-model with $\zetat_1 \neq 0$ in the 
reduced theory a non-trivial fixed point $(h^{\rm beta}, k^{\rm beta})$ 
exists where gravity remains self-interacting and coupled to the scalars. 
The fixed point is UV stable under the two-fold infinite set 
of perturbations $(\sbar_l, \kappabar_l)$, $l \geq 1$. An exact analogue 
of the theorem in section 4 holds for both $\sbar_l$ and $\kappabar_l$, 
irrespective of the sign of $\zetat_1 \neq 0$.     
\item[(b)] If $\zetat_1 =0$ the 4D matter consists of a 
collection of free scalar fields. Only a `trivial' fixed 
point exists where the scalars decouple from gravity.
