In this article we try to explain a statement due
to Maxim Kontsevich back in 1999, that the \emph{Holography Principle}
in physics is related to the (higher dimensional)
\emph{Deligne Conjecture} in mathematics. That seems to suggest that the
\emph{little $d$-discs operad} (or equivalently the notion of a
\emph{$d$-algebra}) gives a new way to understand the mathematical aspects of
\textsl{quantum gravity} using \textsl{holography}. The strategy is as
follows: we would like
to learn something about quantum gravity in $(d+1)$ dimensions: we use
holography to reduce our original problem to a CFT in $d$-dimensions. The
deep origin of this dimensional reduction lies on the fact that it is the
\textsl{area} and \emph{not} the \textsl{volume} which appears in the
formula giving the entropy of
black holes as described long ago by Hawking. Then we use $d$-algebras (i.e. 
the little $d$-discs operad) to study our $d$-dim CFT.
The possible relation between $d$-dim CFT and $d$-algebras comes from the 
lesson we have learnt from strings (namely the 2-dim CFT case): the space of 
physical states
in closed string field theory (ie the BRST cohomology) has a natural
\emph{Gerstenhaber} algebra structure and this by Cohen's theorem is related to
the little 2-discs operad. The proposal then is that the relation might hold 
in higher
than 2 dimensions. This approach is algebraic although it would have been be 
much more satisfactory if we could generalise Segal's geometric approach
to CFT in higher than 2 dimensions. Hopefully the article is mathematically
self-contained.
