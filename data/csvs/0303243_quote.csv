When M-theory is compactified on $G_2$-holonomy manifolds
with conical singularities, charged chiral fermions are present
and the low-energy four-dimensional theory is potentially 
anomalous. We reconsider the issue of anomaly cancellation, 
first studied by Witten. We propose a mechanism that provides
local cancellation of all gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational
anomalies, i.e. separately for each conical singularity. It is 
similar in spirit to the one used to cancel the normal bundle
anomaly in the presence of five-branes. It involves smoothly 
cutting off all fields close to the conical singularities,
resulting in an anomalous variation of the 3-form $C$
and of the non-abelian gauge fields present if there 
are also $ADE$ singularities.
