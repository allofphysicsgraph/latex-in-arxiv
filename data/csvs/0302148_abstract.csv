We study the wave equation for  a minimally coupled massive scalar
 in D-dimensional
de Sitter space. We compute the absorption cross section
 to investigate  its cosmological horizon in the southern diamond.
By analogy of the quantum mechanics, it is found that there is no
absorption in  de Sitter space.
This means that de Sitter space is usually  in thermal
equilibrium, like the black hole in anti de Sitter space.
It confirms that the cosmological horizon not
only emits radiation but also absorbs that previously emitted by
itself at the same rate, keeping the curvature radius of de Sitter space
fixed.
