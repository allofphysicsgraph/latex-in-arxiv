We derive the Lagrangian and the transformation laws of $N=4$
gauged supergravity coupled to matter multiplets whose
$\sigma$-model of the scalars is ${\rm SU}(1,1)/{\rm U}(1)\otimes
{\rm SO}(6,6+n)/{\rm SO}(6)\otimes {\rm SO}(6+n)$ and which
corresponds to the effective Lagrangian of the Type IIB string
compactified on the $T^6/\mathbb{Z}_2$ with fluxes turned on and
in presence of $n$ $D3$--branes. The gauge group is $T^{12}\otimes
G$ where $G$ is the gauge group on the brane and $T^{12}$ is the
gauge group
on the bulk corresponding to the gauged translations of the R-R scalars coming from the R-R four--form.\\
The $N=4$ bulk sector of this theory can be obtained as a
truncation of the Scherk--Schwarz spontaneously broken $N=8$
supergravity. Consequently the full bulk spectrum satisfies quadratic and quartic mass sum rules,
identical to those encountered in Scherk--Schwarz reduction gauging a flat group.\\
This theory gives rise to a no scale supergravity extended with
partial super--Higgs mechanism.
