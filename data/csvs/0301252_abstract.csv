The one-loop
energy density of an infinitely thin static magnetic vortex in $SU (2)$
Yang-Mills theory is evaluated using the Schr\""odinger picture. Both the
gluonic fluctuations as well as the quarks in the vortex background are
included. The
energy density of the magnetic vortex is discussed as
a function of the magnetic flux. The center vortices correspond to local minima
in the effective potential. These minima are degenerated with the perturbative
vacuum if the fermions are ignored. Inclusion of fermions lifts this
degeneracy, raising the vortex energy above the energy of the perturbative
vacuum.
