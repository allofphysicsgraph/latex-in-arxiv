The absorption cross section for scattering of fermions off an extreme BTZ black hole is
calculated. It is shown that, as in
the case of scalar particles, an extreme BTZ black hole exhibits an absorption cross section equals
to zero,  what is
consistent with the vanishing entropy of such object. We also show that the Dirac equation, in this
background, can be
solved completely for a very special case where the energy of the incident wave and the azimuthal
eigenvalue must satisfy
a {\it fine tuning condition}. Additionally,  we give a general argument to prove that the particle
flux near the horizon is
zero,  no matter how they are constructed. Finally we show that the {\it reciprocal space}
introduced  previously in \cite{
gm} gives rise to the same result and,  therefore,  it could be considered as the space where the
scattering process take
place in a AdS spacetime.
