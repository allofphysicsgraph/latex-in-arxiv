There are currently many string inspired conjectures
about the structure of the low-energy effective action for
super Yang-Mills theories which require explicit multi-loop
calculations. In this paper, we develop
a manifestly covariant derivative expansion of superspace
heat kernels and present a scheme to evaluate multi-loop
contributions to the effective action in the framework
of the background field method. The crucial ingredient
of the construction is a detailed analysis of the properties
of the parallel displacement propagators associated
with Yang-Mills supermultiples in $\cN$-extended
superspace.
