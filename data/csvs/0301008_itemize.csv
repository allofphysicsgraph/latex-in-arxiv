\item{The representation of the fermions is pseudo-real. The expected
  symmetry breaking pattern is $SU(2N_f)\to Sp(2N_f)$.}
\item{The representation is complex. In this case we expect the
  symmetry breaking pattern to be $SU_L(N_f)\times SU_R(N_f)\to
  SU(N_f)$. An example is fermions in the fundamental representation
  with the number of colours, $N_c\geq 3$. Thus ordinary QCD falls
  into this class.}
\item{The fermions are in a real representation. The expected
  symmetry breaking pattern is then $SU(N_f)\to SO(N_f)$.}
