\item  Every linear or multi-linear set of constraints can be exchanged by
an equivalent regular set. It allows to carry out Dirac's procedure in the
standard way.

\item  A higher order constraint $\phi =C\left( z^{s}-\bar{z}^{s}\right)
^{k}\approx 0$, can be exchanged by the equivalent linear constraint $\chi
=\phi ^{1/k}\approx 0$. If $\chi $ is a second class constraint, the
dynamics of the new system is equivalent to the Lagrangian one. If $\chi $
is first class, the substitution yields a system which is not dynamically
equivalent to the Lagrangian one. In this latter case, one should view the
original Lagrangian as an incomplete, if not a totally inconsistent
description for a dynamical system.
