\item{(i)} $\,$ Consider the perturbative construction of the orbifold. Each brane at 
$x_i^{(0)},i=6,7,8,9$ has an image in $-x_i^{(0)}$. A brane and its image 
make up a physical brane, which can be moved to an arbitrary 
point in $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$. For $x_i^{(0)}=0$, a physical brane appears as a
composite object and can be split in the plane $(x_4,x_5)$.  
The constituents of a physical brane are the two 
types of fractional branes. It is clear that they can only live at the singular point.
The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ action on the Chan-Paton factors on $n_1$ fractional and $n_2$ anti-fractional
branes can be represented with the matrix $\gamma_{\alpha}={\rm diag} \{I_{n_1},-I_{n_2}\}$. 
%At the orbifold point $b=1/2$, they are  
%interchangeable and have  charge $1/2$ under $C_{(4)}$.
%The orbifold 
%projection acts on the Chan-Paton factors of $n_1$ and $n_2$ 
%fractional branes as 
%\begin
That charges and tensions of these objects agree with the mentioned value
follows from a direct computation in the orbifold construction~\cite{dm} or in the boundary 
state formalism~\cite{Billo2001}.
% 
\item{(ii)} $\,$ We can make contact with the discussion in Section 
\ref{genobs} using the following observation.
A fractional brane can be represented as a D5-brane wrapped 
on the collapsed two-cycle of $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$~\cite{PK3,dMtheory}. This object appears as a 3-brane and,
as we will see shortly, it carries D3-charge.
Similarly an anti-fractional
brane is an anti-D5-brane with one unit of flux for the gauge field
living on it: $\int_{S_2} F=-2\pi$~\cite{PK3,dMtheory,Billo2001}.  
This representation is particularly useful when $b\ne 1/2$ and 
the perturbative description of the orbifold is not adequate. 
In this representation, $C_{(4)}^T$ is the reduction of $C_{(6)}$ on the two-cycle and
the corresponding charge is just the D5-charge.
D3-charges and tensions can be read from the action for a D5- or an anti-D5-brane
\begin{eqnarray}
&& -\frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\Bigl[\int dx^6 e^{-\Phi}\sqrt{G+F+B} \\
&&\quad \pm \int(C_{(6)}+C_{(4)}\wedge (F+B)+\frac{1}{2}C_{(2)}\wedge (F+B)^2+
\frac{1}{6}C_{(0)}\wedge (F+B)^3)\Bigr]. \nonumber
\label{BIfrac}
\end{eqnarray} 
The induced D3-charges are $b$ and $(1-b)$, while the
tensions are proportional to $|b|$ and $|1-b|$. For $b\in [0,1)$, these values satisfy the
BPS condition.
% 
\item{(iii)} $\,$ For readers familiar with the Hanany-Witten construction~\cite{wittenM,hw}, we mention that
the same system is T-dual to a set of 
D4-branes stretched between NS5-branes in Type IIA.
The D4-branes have world-volume in the space-time directions $(0,1,2,3,6)$.  
The direction $x_6$ is compactified on a circle of radius $L$. 
The two NS5-branes have world-volume $(0,1,2,3,4,5)$ and sit at 
$x_6=0$ and $x_6=2\pi bL$ respectively, with  $x_7=x_8=x_9=0$.  
The fractional branes can be identified 
with the D4-branes stretched from the first to the second NS5-brane,
the anti-fractional branes with the D4-branes stretched from the
second to the first. A fractional and an anti-fractional brane can
join and give a physical D4-brane, which can move away in
$(x_6,x_7,x_8,x_9)$.  
%The orbifold point $b=1/2$ is symmetric under the exchange of the 
%two NS-branes.

\item{(i)} The curve for $SU(N)$ with $N_f$ flavors is given by the genus-$(N-1)$ 
hyperelliptic Riemann surface
\begin{equation}
y^2=P(x)^2-\Lambda^{2N-N_f}P_f(x),\label{curvesun2}
\end{equation}
where the polynomials $P(x)$ and $P_f(x)$ are expressed in terms of the moduli and hypermultiplet
masses
\begin{equation}
P(x) = \prod _{i=1} ^N (x-u_i),
\qquad \qquad
P_f(k) = \prod _{\alpha =1} ^{N_f}(x-m_\alpha)\, .
\end{equation}
This theory can be realized with $N$ D4-branes stretched between two NS-branes and $N_f$ 
semi-infinite D4-branes. The zeros of the polynomials $P(x)$ and $P_f(x)$ 
represent the positions of the finite  and semi-infinite D4-branes, respectively.
\item{(ii)} The curve for $\prod_{i=1}^k SU(N_i)$ with bi-fundamental 
hypermultiplets in the 
({\boldmath $N_i$},{\boldmath $N_{i+1}$}) and fundamental hypermultiplets
 for $SU(N_1)$ and $SU(N_k)$ is given by
the polynomial in $t$ and $x$   
\begin{equation}
P_{k+1}(x) t^{k+1}+P_{k}(x) t^{k}+... +P_{1}(x) t + P_{0}(x)=0,
\label{curveproduct}
\end{equation}
where $P_s(x)=\prod_{i=1}^{N_s} (x-u^s_i), s=1,...,k$ are degree-$N_s$ polynomials 
containing the information about the moduli for the s$^{th}$-group and $P_{0,k+1}
=\prod_i (x-m^{0,k+1}_i)$
are polynomials containing the information about the masses of the fundamental hypermultiplets.
The curve is not hyperelliptic.
The system can be realized with $k+1$ NS-branes, $N_i$ D4-branes stretching between the
$i-(i+1)$ pair of NS-branes and two set of semi-infinite D4-branes. The zeros of the
polynomials $P_i(x)$ represent the positions of the D4-branes. 
All the dependence on the dynamically generated scales have been suppressed for simplicity.
The case $k=1$ with $P_0\equiv \Lambda^{2N-N_f}P_f,\, P_1\equiv 2P,\, P_2\equiv 1$, reduces
to the curve given above for $SU(N)$ with $N_f$ flavors with the redefinition $y=t+P(x)$.
\item{(iii)} The ${\cal N}=2$ $CFT$ associated to the affine $A_{k-1}$ Dynkin diagram is 
the cyclic quiver $\prod_{i=1}^k SU(N)$
with bi-fundamentals in the ({\boldmath $N_i$},{\boldmath $N_{i+1}$}), 
$i=1,...,N$ where $i=N+1\equiv 1$. 
The theory is conformal. The SW curve is not hyperelliptic
and it is an $N$-sheeted covering of a torus with modular parameter
$\tau$ corresponding 
to the
diagonal coupling constant in the $CFT$ $\tau=\sum_i\tau_i$. The curve
can be written in 
terms
of a meromorphic section of an Higgs bundle on the torus (locally an
hermitian $N\times N$ 

matrix $\Phi$)
\begin{equation}
\det (x I - \Phi)|_{{\rm locally}}=\prod_{i=1}^N (x-u_i)=0.
\label{ellipticcurve}
\end{equation}
$\Phi$ is meromorphic on the torus with exactly
$k$ simple poles whose residues determine the hypermultiplet masses
\cite{wittenM}. 
The systems
can be realized with $N$ D4-branes wrapped on a circle in the presence
of $k$ NS-branes. 
The example
for the $A_1$ case, corresponding to the $\mathbb{R}^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$ singularity, was pictured in Section~\ref{fractional}.
The poles of $\Phi$ correspond to the positions of the NS-branes upon lifting to M-theory
where the circle combines with the M-theory circle in giving a torus\footnote{An explicit representation
of the meromorphic functions can be given in terms of theta functions; if $u$ is the standard
coordinate on the torus represented as a parallelogram in $\mathbb{C}$, the curve can be
represented in a form similar to the previous cases as an infinite polynomial in $t=e^{iu}$
with coefficients that are degree-$N$ polynomials in $x$. Only $k$ polynomials are independent and give
the position of the D4-branes.
The circle has been lifted to its universal covering
$\mathbb{R}$; there is accordingly a precise pattern of repetition in the $x$-polynomials.}.
The case $k=1$ corresponds to $SU(N)$ with a massless adjoint, i.e. the $N=4$ theory.
$SU(N)$ with a massive adjoint can be described with a suitable twist along the circle \cite{dw,wittenM}.
