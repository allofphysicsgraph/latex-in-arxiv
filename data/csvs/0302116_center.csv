\caption[BRI]{Plot of $1-b_0^{(L)}(\omega,z)$
versus $z$ for $L=10$ and
$\omega=0.6,~0.843,~ 1,~2~$.
The
curve
 with $\omega=0.6$
 shows oscillations. They decrease with
increasing $\omega$
and
 becomes flat
 at about
$\omega=0.843$. Further increase
of $ \omega $  tilts the
plateau and
 shows no regime of
minimal sensitivity.
At the
same time, the
minimum of the
curve rises
 rapidly above the
correct value of $1-b_0=0$,
as can be seen from the
upper two curves for $\omega=1$
and
  $\omega=2$, respectively. }

Still the

leading strong-coupling coefficient $b_0^{(L)}$ of the
ground state energy of the
anharmonic oscillator with $x^4$ potential. The errors are plotted over the
order $L$ of the
variational perturbation expansion. At each order, all zeros of the
first derivative have been exploited. Only the
real parts of the
complex roots have been used
to evaluate $b_0^{(L)}$.
The fat points show

 dots represent real zeros. In addition to Fig.~\ref{FigI}, the
results obtained from zeros of the
second derivative of $b_0^{(L)}$ are shown.
They give rise to own families with smaller errors by about 30\%.
At $N=6$, the upper left plot shows
 the start of two families
belonging to the first and second
derivative of $b_0^{(L)}$, respectively.
The deviations of both families
are negative.
 On the upper
right-hand figure, an enlargement visualizes the
next two families starting at $N=15$. Their deviations are
positive. The
bottom row shows two more enlargements
of
families starting at $N=30$ and
 $N=53$, respectively. The deviations  alternate again
in sign.
