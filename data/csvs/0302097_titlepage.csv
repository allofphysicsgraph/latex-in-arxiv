\begin{abstract}
We study  free   massive fermionic ghosts, in the presence of an
extended line of impurities. The corresponding scattering theory
can be formulated by adding to the bulk S-matrix the scattering
amplitudes,  describing the interactions among the bulk
excitations and the defect line (transmission and reflection
amplitudes). Explicit expressions for such matrices can be found
by solving a bootstrap system of equations (unitarity, crossing
and factorization) or, alternatively, relying on a Lagrangian
description in terms of Symplectic fermions. In this framework,
two distinct defect interactions are proposed (a relevant and a
marginal ones), and exact expressions for the correlation
functions of the most significant operators in the theory are
derived, exploiting the bulk form factors and the matrix elements
relative to the defect operator, encoding the entire information
about the inhomogeneities.
