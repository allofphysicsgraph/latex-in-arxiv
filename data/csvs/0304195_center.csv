%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We propose a useful method for deriving the effective theory 
for a system where BPS and anti-BPS domain walls coexist. 
Our method respects an approximately preserved SUSY near each wall. 
Due to the finite width of the walls, SUSY breaking terms arise at tree-level, 
which are exponentially suppressed. 
A practical approximation using the BPS wall solutions is also discussed. 
We show that a tachyonic mode appears in the matter sector 
if the corresponding mode function has a broader profile 
than the wall width.
