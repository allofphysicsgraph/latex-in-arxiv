In the framework of started in Ref.[1] construction procedure of the
general superfield quantization method for gauge theories in
Lagrangian formalism
the rules for Hamiltonian formulation of general superfield theory of fields
(GSTF) are introduced and are on the whole considered.

Mathematical means developed in [1] for Lagrangian formulation of GSTF are
extended to use in Hamiltonian one. Hamiltonization
for Lagrangian formulation of GSTF via Legendre
transform of superfunction $S_{L}\bigl({\cal A}(\theta),
{\stackrel{\ \circ}{\cal A}}(\theta),\theta\bigr)$ with
respect to ${\stackrel{\;\circ}{{\cal A}^{\imath}}}(\theta)$ is considered.
As result on the space $T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{cl}\times \{\theta\}$
parametrized by  supervariables ${\cal A}^{\imath}(\theta)$,
${\cal A}^{\ast}_{\imath}(\theta)$, $\theta$ the superfunction
 $S_{H}({\cal A}(\theta),{\cal A}^{\ast}(\theta),\theta)$ is defined. Being
equivalent to different types of Euler-Lagrange equations the distinct
Hamiltonian systems are investigated. Translations along $\theta$ for
superfunctions on $T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{cl} \times \{\theta\}$
being associated with these systems are studied.
Various types of antibrackets and differential operators acting on
$C^{k}\bigl(T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{cl} \times \{\theta\} \bigr)$ are
considered.

Component (on $\theta$)
formulation for GSTF quantities and operations is produced.
Realization of the GSTF general scheme is demonstrated on  6 models.
