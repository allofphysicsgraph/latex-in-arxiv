\item The superpotential depends on the target space metric only by means 
of K\""ahler moduli, and is independent of the complex structure \cite{quintic}.

\item If we see those K\""ahler moduli as closed string parameters, the 
dependence of the superpotential is roughly of the form
\beq
W = \pm \sum_{n=1}^\infty {e^{-n\Phi} \over n^2},
\label{super}
\eeq
 where $n$ indexes the multiple covers of a disc with same boundary 
conditions, and $\Phi$ stands for the open string chiral superfield 
\cite{ov}.
 The $\pm$ sign corresponds to holomorphic and antiholomorphic maps, 
respectively.

\item There appears a new object: the O-plane, which lies on the 
horizontal axis described by $\{\pim z = 0 \}$ in the covering space $\cpx$.

\item In order to consider well-defined constructions, 
for each D-brane $a$ in our configuration we must 
include its image under $\OR$, denoted by $\Om\R a$ or $a^*$. 
These mirror branes will, generically, wrap a cycle $[\Pi_{a^*}]$ 
different from $
[\Pi_a]$, of course related by the action of $\R$ 
on the homology of the torus.

theta function, whose parameters are

function on the integers $i$, $j$ and $k$. 

\item A triplet of intersections $(i,j,k)$ 
is connected by a family of triangles, that is, 
has a non-zero Yukawa, if and only if
