\begin{abstract}
Regularization of quantum field theories introduces a mass scale
which breaks axial rotational and scaling invariances. We
demonstrate from first principles that axial torsion and torsion
trace modes have non-transverse vacuum polarization tensors, and
become massive as a result.

The underlying reasons are similar to those responsible for the
Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) and scaling anomalies.

Since these are the only torsion components that can couple minimally to spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles, the
anomalous generation of masses for these modes, naturally of the order of the regulator scale, may help to
explain why torsion and its associated effects, including CPT violation in chiral gravity, have so far escaped
detection. As a simpler manifestation of the reasons underpinning the ABJ anomaly than triangle diagrams, the
vacuum polarization demonstration is also pedagogically useful. In addition it is shown that the teleparallel
limit of a Weyl fermion theory coupled only to the left-handed spin connection leads to a counter term which is
the Samuel-Jacobson-Smolin action of chiral gravity in four dimensions.

\section{Introduction and Overview}
\label{sec:level1}

   Torsion $(T_A = de_A + A_{AB}\wedge e^B$) arises naturally in
Riemann-Cartan spacetimes when the vierbein, $e_{\mu A}$, and
spin connection, $A_{\mu AB}$, are assumed to be independent. In
minimal coupling schemes only spinors couple to torsion, and even
then only the axial and trace modes of torsion couple to spin
$\frac{1}{2}$ particles. Actually, in a hermitian theory, only
the axial torsion mode, ${\tilde A}_\mu \equiv
\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\lambda}{\tilde\epsilon}^{\lambda\nu\alpha\beta}
e_{\lambda A}T^A_{\alpha\beta}$, interacts minimally with spin
$\frac{1}{2}$ matter. Recent works have however revealed that even
the well-studied Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly \cite{ABJ}
receives further contributions from torsional invariants
\cite{Yajima,Chandia,cpabj}. Moreover, as we shall demonstrate,
the vacuum polarization diagram with two external axial torsion
vertices is not transverse, and its divergence is controlled by
the Nieh-Yan term \cite{Nieh-Yan}. This breakdown in
transversality occurs in addition to that manifested by the ABJ
triangle diagrams that give rise to a term quadratic in the
curvatures. A striking consequence of this non-transversality is
the generation of mass. We may think of the axial torsion mode as
an ``axial torsion photon"" \cite{cpabj}, coupled to a current
whose conservation has been compromised because of anomaly
considerations.  The associated ``gauge"" invariance, the
$\gamma^5$ rotational symmetry,  is therefore broken, and a mass
results. In this paper, we describe explicitly how this
phenomenon takes place. It should be noted that the breakdown in
current conservation poses no consistency problems; since axial
torsion modes are not gauge field modes, and are not responsible
for any local symmetries.

The standard model incorporates maximal parity and charge conjugation non-conservation by assigning left- and
right- handed fermions to different representations of the internal gauge group. It behooves us to pursue the
extent to which chirality can be used as a defining characteristic of particle interactions, including gravity.
That context leads us to use only Weyl spinors and the Ashtekar formulation of gravity \cite{Ash,cps}. The result
in using only left-handed fermion fields is a minimal coupling $J^\mu_L (i B_\mu + A_\mu) \equiv J^\mu_L C_\mu$
of both the axial torsion and torsion trace fields to the total singlet current $J^\mu_L$ traced over all
left-handed fermion fields. Here, ${A}_\mu \equiv \frac{1}{4e}{\tilde A}_\mu$, while $B_\mu \equiv
\frac{1}{2}e^{\nu A}T_{\mu\nu A}$ is the trace of the torsion field. The first term in $C_\mu$ is anti-hermitian
relative to the second, and hermitizing the action would eliminate it completely. But doing so requires bringing
in right-handed conjugate Weyl fields, which in turn are coupled to the self-dual or right-handed spin connection
fields. These fields are distinct components of the spin connection, and it has already been shown in Ref.
\cite{Ash} that general relativity field equations can be reproduced without reference to them. The system can be
defined by a holomorphic action that is dependent only upon left-handed fields, thereby extending this
characteristic feature of the standard model to cover gravity interactions as well\cite{cps,cpt}. In this scheme
of things, the appearance of $iB_\mu$ is entirely natural. In the regularization scheme adopted in this
paper\cite{invariant}, this property is also maintained, therefore both torsional modes must have the same mass.
The generation of mass for the $B$ field is not self-evident, since it has a vector coupling to the fermion
fields rather than an axial vector coupling.  Based upon our experience with Quantumelectrodynamics (QED), we
might have argued that the associated quanta remain massless. The difference arises because of the anti-hermitian
coupling. The operator appearing in the regularized integrals involves the positive definite form in Euclidean
space $i{D\kern-0.15em\raise0.17ex\llap{/}\kern0.15em\relax}
(i{D\kern-0.15em\raise0.17ex\llap{/}\kern0.15em\relax})^\dagger$. Now
$(i{D\kern-0.15em\raise0.17ex\llap{/}\kern0.15em\relax})^\dagger$ differs from
$i{D\kern-0.15em\raise0.17ex\llap{/}\kern0.15em\relax}$, because of the anti-hermitian nature of the coupling.
For conventional internal gauge fields, the two forms of the covariant derivatives are the same, leading to
hermitian Dirac operators. We shall show how this difference causes the vacuum polarization tensor for $B_\mu$ to
be non-transverse as well.
