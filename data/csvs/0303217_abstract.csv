 We study an RNS string with one end fixed on a $D0$-brane and
the other end free as a qualitative guide to the spectrum of
hadrons containig one very heavy quark. The mixed boundary
conditions break half of the world-sheet supersymmetry.
Boson-fermion masses can still be matched if space-time is 9
dimensional; thus $SO(8)$ triality still plays a role in the
spectrum, although full space-time supersymmetry does not survive.
We quantize the system in a temporal-like gauge where $X^0 \sim
\tau$.  Only odd $\alpha$ and even $d$ R modes remain, while the
NS oscillators $b$ become odd-integer moded.  Although the gauge
choice eliminates negative-norm states at the outset, there are
still even-moded Virasoro and even(odd) moded super-Virasoro
constraints to be imposed in the NS(R) sectors. The Casimir energy
is now positive for R states, but vanishes for NS; there are no
tachyons. States for $\alpha' M^2 \leq 3$ are explicitly
constructed and found to be organized into $SO(8)$ irreps by
(super)constraints, which include a novel ``$\sqrt{L_0}$"" operator
in the NS and $\Gamma^0 \pm I$ in the R sectors. GSO projections
are not allowed.  The distinctive physical signatures of the
system are (i) a slope twice that of the open string, (ii) absence
of all but leading trajectories, yielding an asympotic level
density $\sim N^{\frac{D-1}{2}}$ instead of $\exp{\sqrt{N}}$. When
both ends are fixed, all leading and subleading trajectories are
eliminated instead, resulting in a spectrum qualitatively similar
to the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ particles.
