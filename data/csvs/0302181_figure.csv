\caption{A nonsingular bouncing solution in the low energy tree-level action 
without the axion in the presence of the radiation ($\rho=dp$).  With the 
growth of $\phi=e^{-\vp}$, the universe contracts and exhibits the bounce at 
$\phi=\phi_*$.  After that the scale factor begins to grow and the system 
asymptotically approaches the radiation dominant universe as $\phi \to 
\phi_c$.}

$\mu_0=3.0$, $\dot{\nu}_0=-0.005$, $\nu_0=0.01$, $\psi_0=-14$,

\caption{Phase space trajectories of the solutions of string-gas 
cosmology for $d=3$.  We implement the effect of the massive state
together with the leading massless state. In the absence of the axion
(solid curves), the solutions asymptotically approach the line given by 
$l/f=-1/d$, which represents the radiation dominant universe.  The 
expansion rate $l$ gets larger when the axion is included (dotted curves), 
but the solutions eventually approach the radiation dominant universe.}

of e-folds for $d=3$, $\rho=p=0$ and $n=-1$ with initial conditions 
$\vp_i=-130$ and $H_i=1.5 \times 10^{-3}$.  We include the quantum 
corrections up to $i=2$ with coefficients $C_1=1$ and $C_2=-10^{-3}$

correspond to the evolution without the modulus and axions fields, whereas 
these fields are involved in the solid curves with initial conditions 
$\dot{\chi}_i=10^{-2}$ and $\dot{\sigma}_i=10^{-2}$.  We do not find a 
significant difference even when $\chi$ and $\sigma$ are present.}

the modulus and axions fields for the same initial conditions as

($0<t<100$) is followed by the string phase with a linearly growing dilaton

Both $\dot{\chi}$ and $\dot{\sigma}$ are exponentially suppressed
