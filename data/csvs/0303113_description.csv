\item{(1)}
The matrix $\mathsf{Q}$ is non-singular. In this case $z^3$ is the only manifest
isometry. In the compact case we are dealing with the Salam-Sezgin case 
in which  
the group manifold is equal to $S^3$. The presence of the manifest $z^3$-isometry 
direction is related to the fact that $S^3$ can be viewed as a Hopf fibration 
over $S^2$. One consequence of this fact is that the $D=8$ class A 
supergravities can also be obtained by reduction of the massless IIA theory. 
For instance, the Salam-Sezgin theory can alternatively be obtained by 
reduction of the massless IIA theory over $S^2$. The latter reduction 
naturally occurs in the context of the DW/QFT correspondence 
\cite{Boonstra:1998mp}. In the non-compact case the $SO(3)$ gauging gets 
replaced by an $SO(2,1)$ gauging. This case can be understood as an analytic 
continuation of the Salam-Sezgin theory or as a 
``non-compactification''{}\footnote{As we will see in the next Section in a 
non-compactification we have to discard an infinite factor in front of the 
action. Nevertheless, the procedure leads to a well-defined $D=8$ gauged 
supergravity and, furthermore, can be used as a solution-generating 
transformation of $D=11$ supergravity.} of $D=11$ supergravity.

\item{(2)}
The matrix $\mathsf{Q}$ is singular, e.g. $\mathsf{Q} = \frac{1}{2}{\rm 
diag}(0,q_2,q_3)$. In this case there is an additional isometry in the 
$z^2$-direction:
\begin{align}
  U^m{}_n = \left(
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \cos \alpha & - \sqrt{q_2/q_3}\sin \alpha \\
    0 & \sqrt{q_3/q_2}\sin \alpha & \cos \alpha
  \end{array} \right) \,,\hskip 1truecm {\rm det}\ U = 1\, ,
\label{q2q3}
\end{align}
with $\alpha =\sqrt{\frac{1}{4} q_2 q_3} z^1$. This means that the resulting 
$D=8$ class A gauged supergravities can also be obtained by a reduction of the 
massless 9D theory.

\item{(3)} The matrix $\mathsf{Q}$ is doubly-degenerate, e.g.$\mathsf{Q} = \frac{1}{2}{\rm diag}(0,0,q_3)$. In this case the $U$-matrix is 
given by
\begin{align}
  U^m{}_n = \left(
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & \frac{1}{2}q_3 z^1 & 1
  \end{array} \right) \,,\hskip 1truecm {\rm det}\ U = 1\, ,
\label{q3}
\end{align}
and again the resulting $D=8$ class A gauged supergravity has its origin in 
the massless 9D theory.
