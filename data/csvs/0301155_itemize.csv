\item Already eq.\ \eqref{eq:effpot2} shows that the complete
  Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} is part of the generalized non-local
  version as well. Indeed, the K\""{a}hler potential and the invariant part of
  the superpotential are given by the terms $\propto \alpha_{00}$ and $\propto
  \beta_0$.
\item Most terms from the superpotential \eqref{eq:staticsuppotexp} are redundant as they appear in the
  K\""{a}hler potential already. This is not surprising as a superpotential
  $\propto (\Psi_1)^n$ can be transformed into a full superspace integral
  $\propto \Psi_0 (\Psi_1)^{n-1}$, which is now a contribution to the K\""{a}hler
  potential. Therefore we will set the invariant part of the superpotential to
  zero in the following, except for the linear term $\propto \beta_0$. For
  convenience we still choose $\tilde{\beta}_0 = -c = - 2 \beta /(9 \cg g^3)$
  to cancel the linear contribution from the WZW-term.

\item The value of the effective potential in the minimum is the same.
\item The vacuum expectation values of the fields $\varphi$ and $F$ are
  the same.
\item In a systematic expansion around the ground-state, the dominant
  couplings (including the spectrum) are the same.
\"
2,"\begin{itemize}
\item The superpotential remains a polynomial function in the fields.
\item The dynamics to order $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ cannot be changed by the action
  of the type \eqref{eq:nonlocalkahler}, as a term $\propto \Psi_0 \Box \bar{\Psi}_0$
  does not exist.
\"
3,"\begin{itemize}
\item If the dynamics to order $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ are not stable we choose
  $d_1 > 0$ in such a way that the eigenvalues of the dynamics are all
  positive. This is always possible as
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \eqref{eq:ladd2} has no unstable terms. This follows from $F_0 > 0$
    and $\varphi_0 < 0$. On the other hand it adds stable terms to all possible combinations.
  \item $d_1$ is not constrained.
  \end{enumerate}
\item If $\tilde{g}_{F \bar{F}} > 0$ the dynamics to order $\mathcal{O}(p^4)$
  in $\varphi$ have the wrong sign. Also, the term in $d_1$ adds unstable
  terms in all combinations at this order. These terms are suppressed already, if $p^2
  \ll \Lambda^2$. Nevertheless we might want to change this. We thus choose:
  \begin{equation}
    d_2 > \frac{9}{16} (\bar{\varphi} \varphi)_0^{\frac{4}{3}} (\bar{F}
    F)_0^{-1} \bigl( 9 (\bar{\varphi}
    \varphi)_0 \tilde{g}_{F \bar{F}} + d_1 \bigr)
  \end{equation}
  If $\tilde{g}_{F \bar{F}} < 0$ we relax the constraint for $d_2$ to equation
  \eqref{eq:dcond} below.
\item Now the dynamics are stable to $\mathcal{O}(p^4)$, but $d_2$ adds
  unstable terms to order $\mathcal{O}(p^6)$. In general all unstable terms
  are getting removed by the recursive formula
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dcond}
    d_k > \frac{9}{(k+2)^2} (\bar{\varphi} \varphi)_0^{\frac{4}{3}} (\bar{F}
    F)_0^{-1} d_{k-1} \ .
  \end{equation}
  In addition to the suppression by orders of $\Lambda$ the new coupling
  constants can thus be chosen suppressed by a factor $k^{-2}$.
