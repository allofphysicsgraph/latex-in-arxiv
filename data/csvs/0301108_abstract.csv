The continuous and discrete symmetries of the Dirac-type operators produced 
by particular Killing-Yano tensors are studied in manifolds of arbitrary 
dimensions. The Killing-Yano tensors considered are covariantly 
constant and realize  certain square roots of the metric tensor. Such a 
Killing-Yano tensor produces simultaneously a Dirac-type operator and the 
generator of a one-parameter Lie group connecting this operator with the 
standard Dirac one. The Dirac operators are related among themselves through 
continuous or discrete transformations. The groups $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$  of 
continuous transformations are typical for (hyper-)K\""ahler spaces, but in 
general the requirements for these special geometries are not fulfilled. 
The discrete symmetries are also studied obtaining the discrete groups  
${\Bbb Z}_4$ and ${\Bbb Q}$.. The briefly presented examples are the 
Euclidean Taub-NUT space and the Minkowski spacetime.
