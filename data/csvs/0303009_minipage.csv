Realistic heterotic string models require the presence of
the Wilson lines.
We study the effect of continuous Wilson lines on the heterotic Yukawa couplings for abelian orbifold compactifications  and find that  
the presence of continuous Wilson lines 
affects the magnitude of the twisted Yukawa couplings
resulting in their stronger hierarchy.
