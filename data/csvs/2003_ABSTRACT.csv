{\bf Abstract.}\quad
We provide a systematic study on the possibility of supersymmetry (SUSY) for one dimensional quantum mechanical systems consisting of a pair of lines $\R$ or intervals  $[-l, l]$ each having a point singularity. We consider the most general singularities and walls (boundaries) at $x = \pm l$ admitted quantum mechanically, using a $U(2)$ family of parameters to specify one singularity and similarly a $U(1)$ family of parameters to specify one wall.   With these parameter freedoms, we find that for a certain subfamily the line systems acquire an $N = 1$ SUSY which can be enhanced to $N = 4$ if the parameters are further tuned, and that these SUSY are generically broken except for a special case.  The interval systems, on the other hand, can accommodate $N = 2$ or $N = 4$ SUSY,  broken or unbroken, and exhibit a rich variety of (degenerate) spectra. Our SUSY systems include the familiar SUSY systems with the Dirac $\delta(x)$-potential, and hence are extensions of the known SUSY quantum mechanics to those with general point singularities and walls.  The self-adjointness of the supercharge in relation to the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian is also discussed.}->2003/0302089.tex

leads to an inconsistent theory. In a warped fifth dimension, 
an explicit breaking of all bulk supersymmetries by the boundaries

complete supersymmetry breaking by boundary conditions is not consistent 
with supergravity. Despite this result, the low energy effective theory
resulting from boundary supersymmetry breaking becomes consistent

  investigate the construction of central extensions of the

We present a derivation of the entropy of black holes in induced
gravity models based on conformal properties of induced gravity
constituents near the horizon. The four-dimensional (4D) theory
is first reduced to a tower of two-dimensional (2D) gravities
such that each 2D theory is induced by fields with certain momentum
$p$ along the horizon. We demonstrate that in the vicinity of the
horizon constituents of the
2D induced gravities are described by conformal field theories (CFT)
with specific central charges depending on spin and non-minimal
couplings and with specific correlation lengths depending on the
masses of fields and on the momentum $p$. This enables one to use CFT
methods to count partial entropies $s(p)$ in each 2D sector.
The sum of partial entropies correctly reproduces the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the 4D induced gravity theory. Our
results indicate that earlier attempts of the derivation of the
entropy of black holes based on a near-horizon CFT may have a
microscopic realization.

One finds that the D-dimensional YST and its modified version (MYST) have the background symmetry SO(D+1,1) and SO(D,2), which are well known to underlie the dS/CFT and AdS/CFT correspondences, respectively. This fact suggests a new possibility of dS/YST and AdS/MYST in parallel with dS/CFT and AdS/CFT, respectively. The spatial components of quantized space-time and momentum operators of YST have discrete eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and $1/R$, without contradiction to Lorentz-covariance. With respect to MYST, the spatial components of space-time operators and the time component (energy) of momentum operators have discrete eigenvalues and their respective minimums, $a$ and $1/R$, in contrast to YST.

It would be extremely useful to know whether a particular low energy

Here, this problem is
approached from 
the ground up by considering theories with multiple interacting
massive gravitons.
It is actually
very difficult to construct discrete gravitational dimensions
which have a local continuum limit.
In fact, any model with only nearest neighbor interactions is doomed.
If we could find a non-linear extension for the Fierz-Pauli
Lagrangian for a graviton of mass $m_g$
which does not break down until the scale 
$\Lambda_2=\sqrt{m_g \mpl}$,
this could be used to construct a 
large class of models whose continuum limit is
local in the extra dimension.
But this is shown to be impossible: 
a theory with a single graviton
must break down by $\Lambda_3 = (m_g^2 \mpl)^{1/3}$.
Next, we look at
how the discretization prescribed by the
truncation of the KK tower of an
honest extra diemsinon rasies the scale of strong coupling.
It dictates an intricate set of interactions among various
fields which conspire to soften the strongest
scattering amplitudes and allow for a local continuum limit,
at least at tree-level.
A number of canditate symmetries associated with locality
in the discretized dimension are also discussed.

the AdS$_5 \times$ S$^5$ background, carrying appropriate
representations of the super conformal group PSU$(2,2|4)$. The
standard Hamiltonian operator which causes evolution in the light-cone
time has continuous eigenvalues and provides a basis of states which
is not suitable for comparing with the dual super Yang-Mills
theory. However, there exist operators in the light-cone gauge which

energy-momentum tensor components. The later are secondary constraints of the theory. Due to the
presence of the dilaton field the Virasoro generators have nonlinear realization. We find that, in
the curve space-time, opposite chirality currents do not commute. As a consequence of the
two-dimensional general covariance, the energy-momentum tensor components satisfy two Virasoro
algebras, even in the curve space-time.  We obtain new gauge symmetry which acts on both
world-sheet and space-time variables, and includes world-sheet Weyl transformation. We emphasize
that background antisymmetric and dilaton fields are the origin of space-time torsion and
space-time nonmetricity, respectively.}->2003/0304085.tex

\abstract{In the present article, we study the space-time geometry felt by
probe bosonic string moving in antisymmetric and dilaton background fields.
This space-time geometry we shall call the stringy geometry. In particular,
the presence of the antisymmetric field leads to the space-time torsion, and
the presence of the dilaton field leads to the space-time nonmetricity. We
generalize the geometry of surfaces embedded in space-time to the case when
torsion and nonmetricity are present. We define the mean extrinsic curvature
for Minkowski signature and introduce the concept of mean torsion. Its
orthogonal projection defines the dual mean extrinsic curvature. In this
language, one field equation is just the equality of mean extrinsic curvature
and dual mean extrinsic curvature, which we call C-duality relation. In the
torsion and nonmetricity free case, the world-sheet is a minimal surface,
specified by the requirement that mean extrinsic curvature vanishes.
Generally, it is stringy C-dual surface. In the presence
of the dilaton field, which breaks conformal invariance, the conformal factor
which connects intrinsic and induced metrics, is determined as a function of
the dilaton field itself. We also derive the integration measure for the
space-time with stringy nonmetricity.}->2003/0304086.tex
\abstract{A prescription for calculating low-energy one-loop higher-mass dimensional effective Lagrangians for non-Abelian field theories is constructed in the spirit of quasilocal background field method. Basis of Lorentz and gauge-invariant monomials of similar mass-dimensions acting as building blocks are matrix-multiplied in a specified order (usually dictated by a permutation of tensorial indices) generating the much needed invariants. The same set of building blocks is used to generate higher-order corrections for a specific mass-dimension. Though the gauge group, the spacetime dimensions, the order of corrections that can be included, and the mass-dimensions that can be formed are all kept arbitrary in the prescription, we constructed basis invariants from 3 up to 12 mass-dimensions to accommodate higher-order corrections up to fourth-order. With these basis, we pursued solving the zeroth-order corrections leading to invariants from 2 up to 16 mass-dimensions, for first-order from 4 up to 8 mass-dimensions, second and third order corrections from 6 up to 8 mass-dimensions. As a result, we  have reproduced the zeroth-order corrections showing dependence on the covariant derivative of the background matrix potential. Previous calculation was done up to 12 mass-dimensions but this dependence was not shown in closed form. For higher-order corrections, the case for 4 up to 6 mass-dimensions are also reproduced. Finally, we calculated the case for 8 mass-dimensions which is reduced only by exploiting the antisymmetry of the fieldstrength tensor and the freedom to throw away total derivatives.}->2003/0304088_cleaned.tex
\abstract{
We present a comprehensive study of the cosmological solutions of 6D braneworld
models with azimuthal symmetry in the extra dimensions, moduli stabilization by flux or
a bulk scalar field, and which contain at least one 3-brane that could be identified
with our world.  We emphasize an unusual property of these models: their expansion rate
depends on the 3-brane tension either not at all, or in a nonstandard way, at odds
with the expected dimensional reduction of these systems to 4D general relativity
at low energies.  Unlike other braneworld attempts to find a self-tuning solution
to the cosmological constant problem, the apparent failure of decoupling in these
models is not associated with the presence of unstabilized moduli.  They could 
therefore provide a distinctive step toward understanding the smallness of the
observed cosmological constant.}->2003/0304147.tex
\abstract{The time-varying density of D-branes and anti-D-branes
in an expanding universe is calculated.  The D-brane anti-brane
annihilation rate is shown to be too small to compete with the
expansion rate of a FRW type universe and the branes over-close
the universe. This brane problem is analogous to the old monopole
problem.  Interestingly however, it is shown that small dimension
D-branes annihilate more slowly than high dimension branes. Hence,
an initially brany universe may be filled with only low dimension
branes at late times.  When combined with an appropriate late
inflationary theory this leads to an attractive dynamical way to
create a realistic braneworld scenario.

\abstract{We argue that the ${\cal N}=1$ higher-spin theory on AdS$_4$ is
holographically dual
to the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric critical $O(N)$ vector model in
three dimensions. This appears to be a special form of the AdS/CFT correspondence in
which both regular and irregular bulk modes have similar roles and their
interplay leads simultaneously to both the free and the 
interacting phases of the boundary theory. We study various boundary
conditions that correspond to boundary deformations connecting, for
large-$N$, the free and interacting boundary theories. We point out the
importance of parity in this holography and elucidate the Higgs
mechanism responsible for the breaking of higher-spin symmetry for
subleading $N$.

\abstract{Using only general properties of the tachyon potential we
show that inflation may be generic when many branes and anti-branes
become coincident. Inflation may occur because of: (1) the assistance of
the many diagonal tachyon fields; (2) when the tachyons condense in a
staggered fashion; or (3) when some of them condense very late.  We point
out that such inflation is in some sense a stringy implementation of
chaotic inflation and may have important applications for
``regularizing'' a lopsided or singular cosmological compact surface.

We study gravitational corrections to the  effective superpotential in 
theories with a single adjoint chiral multiplet, using the generalized 
Konishi anomaly and the gravitationally
deformed chiral ring. We show that the genus one
correction to the loop equation in the corresponding matrix model agrees with
the gravitational corrected anomaly equations in the gauge theory. 
An important ingrediant in the proof is the lack of factorization of chiral
gauge invariant operators in presence of a supergravity background. We
also find a genus zero gravitational correction to the superpotential,
which can be removed by a field redefinition. }->2003/0304227.tex

\abstract{We consider the thermal properties of IIA string theory
on the pp-wave which comes from the circle compactification of the
maximally supersymmetric eleven dimensional pp-wave. The one loop
free energy is computed and Hagedorn temperature is found as a
function of the RR-flux $\mu$. In the $\mu \rightarrow \infty$
limit, the free energy is shown to be identical with that of IIB
string theory on maximally supersymmetric pp-wave. We use two
complementary approaches, operator and path integral methods.
Several points, including the zero point energy and the modular
properties of the free energy, are more illuminating and
transparent in the path integral method. We find the complete
agreement between those two approaches in the free energy
expression and the dependency of the Hagedorn temperature on the
RR-flux.}->2003/0304239.tex
\abstract{In our previous papers, we prove the no-ghost theorem without light-cone directions (hep-th/0005002, hep-th/0303051). We point out that our results are valid for more general backgrounds. In particular, we prove the no-ghost theorem for $AdS_3$ in the context of the BRST quantization (with the standard restriction on the spin). We compare our BRST proof with the OCQ proof and establish the BRST-OCQ equivalence for $AdS_3$. The key in both approaches lies in the certain structure of the matter Hilbert space as a product of two Verma modules. We also present the no-ghost theorem in the most general form.}->2003/0304254.tex
\abstract{We argue that an effective four-dimensional cosmological
constant can naturally be of order $1/r^4$ in six-dimensional
supergravity compactified on two dimensions having radius $r$,
with supersymmetry broken on non-supersymmetric 3-branes (on one
of which we live). In the scenario where the extra dimensions are
sub-millimeter in size, this is the correct size to describe the
recently-discovered dark energy. This mechanism therefore predicts
a connection between the observed size of the cosmological
constant, and potentially observable effects in sub-millimeter
tests of gravity and at the Large Hadron Collider. Corrections to
this small cosmological constant remain small for two reasons. For
branes having specific properties, the large brane tensions due to
the zero-point energies of brane-bound particles are cancelled by
the curvature and dilaton of the transverse two dimensions.
Six-dimensional supersymmetry then enforces the cancellation of
bulk modes down to their supersymmetry-breaking scale, which is
naturally of order $1/r$. We find a potential realization of the
mechanism by inserting branes into an anomaly-free version of
Salam-Sezgin gauged 6D supergravity compactified on a 2-sphere
with nonzero magnetic flux.}->2003/0304256.tex
\abstract{We investigate the quantum structure of Witten's cubic open
bosonic string field theory by computing the one-loop contribution to
the open string tadpole using both oscillator and conformal field
theory methods.  We find divergences and a breakdown of BRST
invariance in the tadpole diagram arising from tachyonic and massless
closed string states, and we discuss ways of treating these problems.
For a D$p$-brane with sufficiently many transverse dimensions, the
tadpole can be rendered finite by analytically continuing the closed
string tachyon by hand; this diagram then naturally incorporates the
(linearized) shift of the closed string background due to the presence
of the brane.  We observe that divergences at higher loops will doom
any straightforward attempt at analyzing general quantum effects in
bosonic open string field theory on a D$p$-brane of any dimension, but
our analysis does not uncover any potential obstacles to the existence
of a sensible quantum open string field theory in the supersymmetric
case.}->2003/0304259.tex

We look for solutions in Einstein gravity corresponding to inflating
braneworlds of arbitrary dimension and co-dimension. These solutions
correspond to isolated sources (no long range fields). Using dynamical
systems techniques, we show that there exists a unique solution corresponding
to a black $p$-brane with a regular horizon at the location of the brane.
The solution is {\it not} however asymptotically flat, but has global
deficit angles.

\abstract{This review of bosonic string field theory is concentrated
on two main subjects. In the first part we revisit the construction
of the three string vertex and rederive the relevant Neumann
coefficients both for the matter and the ghost part following a
conformal field theory approach.
We use this formulation to solve the VSFT equation of motion
for the ghost sector. This part of the paper is based on a new method
which allows us to derive known results in a simpler way.
In the second part we concentrate on the solution of the VSFT
equation of motion for the matter part. We describe the construction
of the three strings vertex in the presence of a background $B$ field.
We determine a large family of lump solutions, illustrate their
interpretation as D--branes and study the low energy limit.
We show that in this limit the lump solutions flow toward the so--called
GMS solitons. }->2003/0304270.tex
