We study Born-Infeld type tachyonic effective action of unstable
D2-brane with a runaway potential and find rich structure of
static regular solitonic solutions.
There exists only periodic array of tachyon kink-antikinks
in pure tachyonic theory, however, in the presence of electromagnetic fields,
solutions include periodic arrays, topological tachyon kinks, half kink, and
bounces. Computed tension of each kink or single unit of the periodic array
has $T_{1}=\sqrt{2}\pi T_{2}$ or that with a multiplicative factor 
depending on electric field. 
When both electric and magnetic fields are turned on, fundamental string 
charge density has a confined component in addition to a constant piece.
These evidences imply that the obtained codimension-1 objects
are likely to be interpreted as D1-brane (and D1F1) or array of
D1$\bar{{\rm D}}1$ (and D1F1-$\bar{{\rm D}}1$F1) as was the case without
the electromagnetic fields.
Generalization to unstable D$p$-branes is straightforward.
