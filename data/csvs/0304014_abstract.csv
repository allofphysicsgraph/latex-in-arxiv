We extend the formalism introduced in the paper hep-th/0209050 to
compute correlation functions in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We show how the
on-shell action of a scalar field in a compactification of AdS space can
be obtained by flowing in the space of (non-local) theories with
different sizes of the extra-dimension. Our method is relevant in
particular for holographic computations in the Randall-Sundrum
scenario with one or two branes and it allows the inclusion of brane-localized
actions in a systematic way. The method can also be
generalized to other backgrounds and does not rely on explicit
knowledge of the solutions of the wave-equations.
