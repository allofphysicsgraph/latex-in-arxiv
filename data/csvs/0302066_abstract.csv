We calculate the euclidean partition function of the type IIA NS five-brane
wrapped on an arbitrary Calabi-Yau space in a double-scaling decoupling limit
and in the presence of a flat RR 3-form background field. The result is the 
product of a theta function, coming from the classical fluxes of the self-dual 
tensor field, and a factor representing the quantum contributions. The 
quantum factor turns out to be related to topological B-model string amplitudes, 
and both factors satisfy a holomorphic anomaly equation. The result can
teach us more about little string theories and about instanton corrections to
four-dimensional effective quantities.
