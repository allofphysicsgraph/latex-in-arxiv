\caption{In a spacetime with 3 units of $H$ flux, stacks of 3 D3-branes are unstable.  D3-brane charge is measured by Gauss' Law, that is by the integral of $dC_4$ over a linking 5-cycle $\partial U$.  By Stoke's Theorem this is an integral over the region $U$, but the two different choices of $U$ drawn above yield answers which differ by $3$.  This ill-definedness in D3-brane charge is a consequence of the instability of stacks of 3 D3-branes.}\label{uandu}

\caption{Consider massless IIA SUGRA on a spacetime with 4 units of $H$ flux, stacks of 4 D6-branes are unstable.  The decay occurs via a mortal D8-brane.  As the D8-brane sweeps out space, it leaves behind it massive IIA with a Romans mass $G_0=1$.  This does not correspond to a twisted K-theory class because $H\wedge G_0\neq 0$.} \label{mms}

\caption{Consider massless IIA SUGRA on a spacetime with 3 units of $H$ flux on a 3-cycle, stacks of 3 D0-branes are unstable.  The decay occurs via a mortal D2-brane.  As the D2-brane sweeps out the 3-cycle, it leaves behind it one unit of $G_6$ flux.  The wedge product $G_6\wedge H=k$ is nontorsion and so again the final configuration does not correspond to any twisted K-theory class.} \label{mms2}

\caption{An M5-brane wraps a trivial 3-cycle $S^3_D$.  This leads to a nontrivial $E_8$ bundle over every linking $S^4$, characterized by a transition function $S^3_E\longrightarrow E_8$.  This transition function represents a nontrivial class in $\pi_3(E_8)$.  A choice of $x\in S^3_E$ in each $S^4$ is mapped to some basepoint in $E_8$ for each $S^4$.  $S^4$'s are labeled by their centers $y\in S^3_D$, and thus for each $x$ there is a map $S^3_D\longrightarrow E_8$.  $E_8$ approximates the classifying space $K(\Z,3)$ and therefore the homotopy class of the map determines an element of the 3rd cohomology group of the M5-brane's worldvolume.  This element is the worldvolume 3-form fieldstrength $T_3$ and so the homotopy class of this map equals the M2-brane charge of the dielectric M5-brane.} \label{e8}

\caption{An NS5-brane sweeps out a 5-cycle which supports 3 units of $G_5$ flux.  When it decays, it leaves 3 D-strings.  Later these D-strings decay via the same process by which they were created.  The initial and final states are included in the twisted K-theory classification.  However the monodromy about the NS5-brane relates distinct cohomology classes which do \textit{not} represent the same K-theory class.  This is one way in which the K-theory classification is modified by the inclusion of processes involving NS5-branes.}

\caption{In a background with two units of $H$ flux a mortal D5-branes sweeps out a 3-cycle, leading to the creation of unstable D3-branes which later decay by the same process.  The initial and final states are described by twisted K-theory and this is the kind of process which leads to an identification of $dC_4$ fluxes that differ by two units.  However in this case the entire process is linked by an NS5-brane bubble, which leads to an additional unit of $H$ flux inside the bubble.  This means that fields inside the bubble are identified modulo $3$, while those outside continue to be identified modulo $2$.  Alternately this may be read from the monodromies, observing that $ddC_4$ is supported on the NS5-brane bubble, and its support depends on $C_2$ which itself experiences a monodromy and thus its value is one greater as the loop leaves the bubble than when the loop entered, leading to the expected one unit shift in the $dC_4$ monodromy.}
