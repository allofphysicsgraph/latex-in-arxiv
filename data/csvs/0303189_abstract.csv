We consider a classical spinning particle in the frame of the
relativistic physics by means of a covariant Hamiltonian and of a
generalization of Poisson brackets which take into account the 
gauge fields.
We obtain different equations of motion and evolution in this context and we
compare our results with those of Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi. An extension to
the case of a curved space and a link towards quantum theory
are given at the end of the paper.
