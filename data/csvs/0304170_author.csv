The Skyrme model is considered using the explicit parametrization
of the rotation group ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ by elements of its algebra.
Topologically nontrivial solutions arise even in the one-dimensional
case because the fundamental group of the group ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ is equal
to ${\mathbb Z}_2$. Static one-dimensional solutions are found explicitly
and analyzed. There are topologically nontrivial solutions with finite
energy among them. New class of projective models is proposed with a
target space which is an arbitrary real projective space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d$.

\section{Introduction}
%********************************************************************
The Skyrme model \cite{Skyrme61} is one of the fundamental models in
contemporary mathematical physics which finds applications in different
fields of physics from the theory of elementary particles to solid
state physics. The model was originally proposed in terms of four
scalar fields taking values on a three-dimensional sphere ${\mathbb S}^3$.
The Lagrangian for the model can be also written in terms of elements
of the algebra $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}(2)$ since a sphere ${\mathbb S}^3$ is diffeomorphic
to the group ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$ as a manifold. As long as the fundamental and
the second homotopic groups of unitary groups ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(n)$, $n\ge2$, and
spheres ${\mathbb S}^n$, $n\ge3$, are trivial there are no one- and two-dimensional
topologically nontrivial solutions in the corresponding models. For this
parametrization of the Skyrme model topologically nontrivial solutions are
related to the third homotopic group $\pi_3({\mathbb S}^3)={\mathbb Z}$. However these
solutions are not found in explicit form.

During subsequent years much attention was also paid to ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(n)$-models
where a target space is any dimensional sphere ${\mathbb S}^{n-1}$ with the
rotational group ${\mathbb O}(n)$ as the symmetry group. Review of these models
and references can be found in monographs [2--6].
\nocite{Rajara82R,TakFad86R,Zakrze89,RybSan01R}%
In what follows we shall call these models ${\mathbb S}^{n}$-models keeping the
term ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(n)$-model for the case where the target space is the group
manifold by itself.

Topological solitons of the lowest dimension exist for ${\mathbb S}^1$-models for
which $\pi({\mathbb S}^1)={\mathbb Z}$. These are, for example, well known kinks in
the sine--Gordon model. Topologically nontrivial solutions for higher
homotopic groups appear in the ${\mathbb S}^2$-model where the second homotopic
group is nontrivial $\pi_2({\mathbb S}^2)={\mathbb Z}$. Corresponding static solutions with
nontrivial topological charge were found and analyzed in \cite{BelPol75R}.

As was already noted the Lagrangian for the Skyrme model can be written
in terms of the $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}(2)$ algebra elements. As far as the algebras for
the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$ and ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ groups are isomorphic, the Skyrme model
can be considered as the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model with the group manifold by
itself as the target space. To this end we use known (see, for example,
\cite{EllDaw79}) but not widely used explicit parametrization of the
rotational group ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$. So we are working with the three-dimensional
group manifold directly. Topologically nontrivial solutions appear here
even in a one-dimensional case since the fundamental group of the rotational
group ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ is nontrivial $\pi({\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3))={\mathbb Z}_2$. Corresponding static
solutions are explicitly found. They are analyzed and compared with the
static solutions of the ${\mathbb S}^2$-model.

Explicit parametrization of the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ group used in the present
paper allows one to make a generalization. It is well known that the
${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ group manifold is diffeomorphic to a three-dimensional
projective space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^3$ (see, for example, \cite{DuNoFo98R}).
It makes possible to generalize the Skyrme model to the case of arbitrary
projective spaces over a field of real numbers when the target space is
an arbitrary projective space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^n={\mathbb S}^n/{\mathbb Z}_2$. The projective
space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^n$ can be parametrized by points in the Euclidean space
$\lbrace\omega^i\rbrace\in{\mathbb R}^n$ lying inside the ball
$\omega=\sqrt{\omega^i\omega_i}\le\pi$ for which the antipodal points of the
boundary sphere of radius $\pi$ are identified. With this parametrization
of a projective space the Lagrangian for an ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^n$-model depends on
$n$ fields $\omega^i(x)$, $i=1,\dotsc,n$, and is invariant under local
discreet transformations $\omega^i\rightarrow\omega^i+2\pi\omega^i/\omega$.
In contrast to gauge models the symmetry group at every point of a
space-time is not a Lie group but a discreet group ${\mathbb Z}$ of translations
on a constant vector. Representation of the translational group is
local and does depend on a space-time point because direction of
a vector changes continuously.

We start our consideration by describing the explicit parametrization
of the ${\mathbb O}(3)$ group. In sections 3, 4 and 5 we write down Lagrangian
for ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-, ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$- and ${\mathbb S}^2$-models, respectively, and
discuss their relationship. Static solutions for ${\mathbb S}^2$- and
${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-models are found and compared in sections 6 and 7. The
${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model is generalized to arbitrary real projective spaces
${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d$ in section 8.

\section{Parametrization of three-dimensional \\ rotational group}
%********************************************************************
It is convenient for calculations with the ${\mathbb O}(3)$ group to use
explicit parametrization of group elements by elements of its algebra.
An $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(3)$ algebra element can be parametrized by an arbitrary
antisymmetric $3\times3$-matrix
\begin{equation}                                        \label{epeans}
  (\omega\varepsilon)_i{}^j=(\omega^k \varepsilon_k)_i{}^j=\omega^k\varepsilon_{ki}{}^j~~\in\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(3),
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon_{ijk}$ is the totally antisymmetric third rank tensor,
$\varepsilon_{123}=1$, and raising and lowering of indices are performed with
the Kronecker symbol. Here the first index $k$ enumerate the basis of the
algebra while indices $i,j$ are considered as matrix ones. An algebra
element is parametrized by three-dimensional vector $\omega^k\in{\mathbb R}^3$,
and thus the ${\mathbb O}(3)$ group is three-dimensional. There is one
${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ group element from the component connected to the unity
element corresponding to each element of the algebra
\begin{equation}                                        \label{elsogr}
  S_{(+)i}{}^j=(e^{(\omega\varepsilon)})_i{}^j={\sf\,cos\,}\omega\,delta_i^j
  +\frac{(\omega\varepsilon)_i{}^j}\omega{\sf\,sin\,}\omega
  +\frac{\omega_i\omega^j}{\omega^2}(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)~          \in{\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3),
\end{equation}
where $\omega=\sqrt{\omega^i\omega_i}$ is the modulus of the vector $\omega^i$.
Straightforward calculations easily show that $S_{(+)i}{}^j$ is the
orthogonal matrix indeed. Let us note that the group element has
symmetric as well as antisymmetric part in contrast to the algebra
element. One can check that the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ group element is invariant
with respect to translation of a vector
$\omega^i\rightarrow\omega^i+2\pi\omega^i/\omega$
\begin{equation*}
  S_{(+)i}{}^j\left(\omega^k+2\pi\frac{\omega^k}\omega\right)=S_{(+)i}{}^j(\omega^k),
\end{equation*}
and this is the only invariance. The shift of vector $\omega^i$
changes only its length $\omega\rightarrow\omega+2\pi$, leaving its
direction unchanged. One can easily convince oneself of
the symmetry of the rotational matrix by noting that the ratio
$\omega^i/\omega$ defining the direction of vector $\omega^i$ remains
unchanged under an arbitrary shift
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\omega^i}\omega\rightarrow\frac{\omega^i+c\omega^i/\omega}{\omega+c}=\frac{\omega^i}\omega,
  ~~~~c\in{\mathbb R}.
\end{equation*}
It means that an element of rotational group is parametrized by a point
of Euclidean space $\omega^i\in{\mathbb R}^3$ with the only equivalence relation
\begin{equation}                                        \label{eqrsog}
  \omega^i\approx\omega^i+2\pi\frac{\omega^i}\omega.
\end{equation}
Here the uncertainty at zero is defined along radial directions
$\omega^i=Cepsilon k^i$, $Cepsilon\to0$. That is the origin of the coordinate system
is identified with the spheres of radii $2\pi m$, $m=1,2,\dotsc$.

The vector $\omega^i$ parametrizes the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ group in the
following way. The direction of the vector $\omega^i$ coincides with the
rotational axis and its modulus $\omega$ equals the rotational angle.
In this way each ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ group element is identified with the point
of three-dimensional ball ${\mathbb B}^3_\pi$ of radius $\pi$ and with the center
at the coordinate origin. Different rotations correspond to different
points, and antipodal points of the boundary sphere have to be identified
because rotations by angles $\pi$ and $-\pi$ around a fixed axis yield
the same result.

Full group of three-dimensional rotations ${\mathbb O}(3)$ consists of two
disconnected components: orthogonal matrices with positive $S_{(+)}$ and
negative $S_{(-)}$ determinants. Elements of the full ${\mathbb O}(3)$ group are
parametrized by algebra elements (\ref{epeans}) in the following way
\begin{equation}                                        \label{elsogt}
  S_{(\pm)i}{}^j={\sf\,cos\,}\omega\,delta_i^j+\frac{(\omega J)_i{}^j}\omega{\sf\,sin\,}\omega
  +\frac{\omega_i\omega^j}{\omega^2}(\pm1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)~\in{\mathbb O}(3),
\end{equation}
Let us note that there are two group elements $S_{(\pm)}\in{\mathbb O}(3)$
by one from each component which correspond to every element of the
algebra $(\omega\varepsilon)_i{}^j\in\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(3)$.

The inverse matrices have the form
\begin{equation}                                        \label{elsogi}
  S^{-1}_{(\pm)i}{}^j(\omega)=S_{(\pm)i}{}^j(-\omega)={\sf\,cos\,}\omega\,delta_i^j
  -\frac{(\omega\varepsilon)_i{}^j}\omega{\sf\,sin\,}\omega
  +\frac{\omega_i\omega^j}{\omega^2}(\pm1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)~\in{\mathbb O}(3),
\end{equation}
that is they correspond to the inverse vector $-\omega^i\in{\mathbb R}^3$. In
other words the inverse group element corresponds to the rotation of
the Euclidean space about the same axis at the opposite angle.

Contraction of the matrix $S_{(\pm)i}{}^j$ with the vector $\omega_j$ yields
\begin{equation*}
  S_{(\pm)i}{}^j\omega_j=\pm\omega_i.
\end{equation*}
It means that the vector $\omega^i$ is the eigenvector for orthogonal matrices
with eigenvalues $\pm1$. In other words rotations ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}_{(+)}$ and
${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}_{(-)}$ leave direction of the rotational axis unchanged or change
it to opposite, respectively.

Suppose that ${\mathbb O}(3)$ group element smoothly depends on a point of an
arbitrary manifold ${\mathbb M}$, that is
\begin{equation*}
  \omega^i(x):~~{\mathbb M}\rightarrow{\mathbb O}(3).
\end{equation*}
Let us introduce the notation
\begin{equation}                                        \label{ealroe}
  l_{(\pm)alpha i}{}^j=(\partial_alpha S_{(\pm)}^{-1}S_{(\pm)})_i{}^j.
\end{equation}
One can show the validity of the following formulae by straightforward
calculations
\begin{equation}                                           \label{ealgrs}
\begin{split}
  l_{(\pm)alpha i}{}^j=\mp\frac{(\partial_alpha\omega\varepsilon)_i{}^j}\omega{\sf\,sin\,}\omega
  -\frac{\partial_alpha\omega(\omega\varepsilon)_i{}^j}\omega\left(1\mp\frac{{\sf\,sin\,}\omega}\omega\right)&
\\
  \pm\frac{\partial_alpha\omega_i\omega^j-\omega_i\partial_alpha\omega^j}{\omega^2}(\pm1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)&
  ~~\in\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(3).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This matrix is antisymmetric in its indices and hence is the element of
the $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(3)$ algebra. It is the trivial ${\mathbb O}(3)$-connection (pure
gauge) for which the curvature tensor is zero. The trivial
${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-connection will be denoted by $l_{alpha i}{}^j=l_{(+)alpha i}{}^j$
in what follows.

The considered parametrization of the rotational group shows that the
group manifold is compact and orientable. As a manifold the component
${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ connected to the unity element coincides with the
three-dimensional projective space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^3$. It is not simply connected,
and its fundamental group is ${\mathbb Z}_2$.

\section{The Lagrangian for the Skyrme model}
%********************************************************************
Let us consider $n$-dimensional Minkowskian space ${\mathbb R}^{1,n-1}$ with
Cartesian coordinates $x^alpha$, $alpha=0,1,\dotsc,n-1$. Let an element
of the rotational group $\omega^i(x)$ be given in each point of the
Minkowskian space. To describe $\pi$-mesons Skyrme proposed the
following action \cite{Skyrme61}
\begin{equation}                                        \label{eskact}
  S=\int dx L=\int dx\left(-\frac\varrho4{\sf\,tr\,}(l_alpha l^alpha)
  -\frac\kappa8{\sf\,tr\,}([l_alpha,l_beta][l^alpha,l^beta])\right),
\end{equation}
where $\varrho$ and $\kappa$ are coupling constants, and square brackets
denote the commutator of matrices. Skyrme considered $l_alpha$ as a
trivial ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$-connection and parametrized it by the four vector
in the isotopic space taking values on a three-dimensional sphere ${\mathbb S}^3$.
That is he considered the action (\ref{eskact}) as the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$-model
or, equivalently, as the ${\mathbb S}^3$-model. We shall consider the action
(\ref{eskact}) as the action for the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model using the
parametrization of the rotational group from the previous section.
Substitution of the expression for $l_alpha$ in terms of the group
parameters (\ref{ealgrs}) yields the following Lagrangian for three
independent scalar fields $\omega^i$
\begin{equation}                                        \label{eacomi}
\begin{split}
  L&=\varrho\left(\frac12\partial_alpha\omega^2
  +(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)\frac{(\partial_alpha\omega\partial_alpha\omega)-\partial_alpha\omega^2}{\omega^2}\right)
\\
  &+\kappa\left((1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)\frac{(\partial_alpha\omega\partial_alpha\omega)\partial_beta\omega^2
  -(\partial_alpha\omega\partial_beta\omega)\partial_alpha\omega\partial_beta\omega}{\omega^2}\right.
\\
  &+\left.(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)^2\frac{(\partial_alpha\omega\partial_alpha\omega)^2
  -(\partial_alpha\omega\partial_beta\omega)^2
  -2(\partial_alpha\omega\partial_alpha\omega)\partial_beta\omega^2
  +2(\partial_alpha\omega\partial_beta\omega)\partial_alpha\omega\partial_beta\omega}{\omega^4}\right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where we introduced notation for the scalar product
\begin{equation*}
  (\partial_alpha\omega\partial_alpha\omega)=\partial_alpha\omega^i\partial_alpha\omega_i\ne\partial_alpha\omega^2.
\end{equation*}
In this expression the summation with Minkowskian metric $\eta_{alphabeta}$
is assumed over repeated Greek indices, and we do not distinguish
lower and upper indices for simplicity. Three fields $\omega^i(x)$ entering
the Lagrangian are independent dynamical variables with no imposed
constraint except the equivalence relation (\ref{eqrsog}). These fields
are scalars with respect to coordinate transformations in the Minkowskian
space ${\mathbb R}^{1,n-1}$ and vector components with respect to global rotations
of the Euclidean target-space ${\mathbb R}^3$. One can check that the Lagrangian
(\ref{eacomi}) is invariant with respect to Poicar\'e group acting in the
Minkowskian space, global ${\mathbb O}(3)$ rotations acting in the target space
$\omega^i\in{\mathbb R}^3$, and local translations (\ref{eqrsog}). The last
transformation means the following. The length of the vector
$\omega^i\in{\mathbb R}^3$ at every point $x\in{\mathbb R}^{1,n-1}$ can be changed on a
constant value divisible by $2\pi$. At the same time this discreet
transformation is a local one because direction of vector $\omega^i$ changes
from point to point. Due to this invariance we shall consider a
vector $\omega^i$ taking values inside the ball of radius $\pi$ with the
center at the coordinates origin on the target space
$\omega^i\in{\mathbb B}^3_\pi\subset{\mathbb R}^3$.

For the analysis of the Skyrme model in the form (\ref{eacomi})
it is convenient to consider four new variables: the length of the
vector $\omega^i$ and its direction instead of the vector $\omega^i$ by
itself
\begin{equation}                                        \label{enewvs}
  \omega=\sqrt{(\omega^1)^2+(\omega^2)^2+(\omega^3)^2},~~~~k^i=\frac{\omega^i}\omega.
\end{equation}
By definition, vector $k^i$ has unit length $(k,k)=k^ik_i=1$.
In terms of new variables the Lagrangian (\ref{eacomi}) takes the form
\begin{equation}                                        \label{elaomn}
\begin{split}
  L&=\varrho\left(\frac12\partial_alpha\omega^2+(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)\right)
\\
  &+\kappa\left(\vphantom{\frac12}(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)
  \left[(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)\partial_beta\omega^2
  -(\partial_alpha k\partial_beta k)\partial_alpha\omega\partial_beta\omega\right]\right.
\\
  &\left.\vphantom{\frac12}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  +(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)^2\left[(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)^2
  -(\partial_alpha k\partial_beta k)^2\right]\right).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Let us remind that $(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)=\partial_alpha k^i\partial_alpha k_i$.
Transformation (\ref{eqrsog}) changes only a length of a vector
\begin{equation}                                       \label{einomn}
  \omega\rightarrow\omega+2\pi,~~~~k^i\rightarrow k^i.
\end{equation}
Now the invariance of the Lagrangian (\ref{elaomn}) with respect to
the transformations (\ref{einomn}) follows immediately. Moreover,
each of the term is invariant by itself.
%*******************************************************************
\section{Comparison with the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$-model}
%********************************************************************
The form of the Skyrme model (\ref{eskact}) for group parameters
depends only on algebra but not on the group which represents the
target space. To show the dependence of the model on the group let us
consider the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$-model. An element of the $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}(2)$ algebra
has the form
\begin{equation*}
  \omega^k\frac i2(\sigma_k)_{\textsc{a}}{}^{\textsc{b}}~\in\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}(2),~~~~{\textsc{a}},{\textsc{b}}=1,2,
\end{equation*}
where $\sigma_k$ denote the Pauli matrices. The factor $i/2$ is chosen to
give commutators of the basis vectors the same form for algebras
$\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{u}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(3)$. The corresponding ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$ group
element has the form
\begin{equation}                                        \label{esutgr}
  U_{\textsc{a}}{}^{\textsc{b}}=(e^{(i\omega\sigma/2)})_{\textsc{a}}{}^{\textsc{b}}
  ={\sf\,cos\,}\frac\omega2delta_{\textsc{a}}^{\textsc{b}}+i\frac{\omega^k\sigma_{k{\textsc{a}}}{}^{\textsc{b}}}\omega{\sf\,sin\,}\frac\omega2
  ~~\in{\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2).
\end{equation}
From this expression for a group element follows the identity
\begin{equation*}
  U_{\textsc{a}}{}^{\textsc{b}}\left(\omega^i+4\pi\frac{\omega^i}\omega\right)=U_{\textsc{a}}{}^{\textsc{b}}(\omega^i).
\end{equation*}
That is there exists the equivalence relation in the parameter space for
the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$ group
\begin{equation}                                        \label{eqrsut}
  \omega^i\approx \omega^i+4\pi\frac{\omega^i}\omega.
\end{equation}
In comparison to the equivalence relation (\ref{eqrsog}) for the group
${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ the shift is performed on a vector having two times greater
length. It means that the group manifold is parametrized by internal points
of a ball ${\mathbb B}^3_{2\pi}$ of radius $2\pi$. In addition all points of
the boundary sphere must be identified. This is the second equivalence
relation in the parameter space
\begin{equation}                                       \label{equspe}
  \omega_1^i|_{\omega_1=2\pi}\approx\omega_2^i|_{\omega_2=2\pi}.
\end{equation}
The extra equivalence relation is due to the absence of the third term
in (\ref{esutgr}) as compared to (\ref{elsogr}). It is the second difference
from the rotational group for which only antipodal points on the boundary
sphere are identified, and this is included in the equivalence relation
(\ref{eqrsog}). It cab be shown that there are no other equivalence
relations in the parameter space except (\ref{eqrsut}) and (\ref{equspe}).

One can easily check that the Lagrangian for the Skyrme model has the
same form (\ref{elaomn}) for both groups ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$ and ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$.
The difference reduces to the equivalence relations (\ref{eqrsog}) and
(\ref{eqrsut}) and identification of points on the boundary sphere
(\ref{equspe}). The last property results in the difference in
fundamental groups leading to the existence of one-dimensional topologically
nontrivial solutions in the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ Skyrme model.
%*******************************************************************
\section{${\mathbb S}^2$-model}
%********************************************************************
The ${\mathbb S}^2$-model attracts much interest many years. Since both the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$
Skyrme model and ${\mathbb S}^2$-model are described by three-dimensional vectors,
and any vector of fixed length can be represented as a result of rotation
of some fixed vector of the same length, there arises a question of
relation between these models.  In spite of nonequivalence of the models
there is the relationship which we consider in the present section.

Consider how the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model from section 3 is linked to the
${\mathbb S}^2$-model. Let unit vector $n^i(x)$, $(n,n)=1$, be given at every
point of the Minkowskian space ${\mathbb R}^{1,n-1}$. This means that the target
space is the two-dimensional sphere ${\mathbb S}^2$. Cartesian coordinates in the
target space will be denoted by capital letters $X,Y,Z$. Let us consider
the Lagrangian proposed by L.~D.~Faddeev for ${\mathbb S}^2$-model \cite{FadNie99A}
\begin{equation}                                        \label{ectmfi}
\begin{split}
  L_\mathrm{F}&=m^2(\partial_alpha n\partial_alpha n)
  +\frac1{e^2}(n^i\varepsilon_{ijk}\partial_alpha n^j\partial_beta n^k)^2,
\\
  &=m^2(\partial_alpha n\partial_alpha n)
  +\frac1{e^2}\left[(\partial_alpha n\partial_alpha n)^2-(\partial_alpha n\partial_beta n)^2\right].
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This model has topologically nontrivial solutions related to the third
homotopic group $\pi_3({\mathbb S}^2)={\mathbb Z}$ [11--14].

Any unit vector $n\in{\mathbb S}^2$ can be parametrized by an element of the group
of three-dimensional rotations
\begin{equation}                                        \label{emintn}
  n^i=n^j_0S_j{}^i(\omega),
\end{equation}
where $n^i_0$ is an arbitrary fixed vector of unit length. This
correspondence is not one to one because two given vectors $n$ and $n_0$
do not define the rotational group element uniquely. Looking ahead we
say that ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$- and ${\mathbb S}^2$-models are not equivalent. The
Lagrangian (\ref{ectmfi}) in parametrization (\ref{emintn}) takes the form
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  L&=m^2\, n_0^in_0^j\partial_alpha S_i{}^k\partial_alpha S_{jk}
\\
  &+\frac1{e^2}\,n_0^i n_0^j n_0^k n_0^l\left(
  \partial_alpha S_i{}^m\partial_alpha S_{jm}\partial_beta S_k{}^n\partial_beta S_{ln}
  -\partial_alpha S_i{}^m\partial_beta S_{jm}\partial_beta S_k{}^n\partial_alpha S_{ln}\right).
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
It depends on three scalar fields $\omega^i(x)$ parametrizing rotational
group and a fixed vector $n_0$. Let us average it over angles
defining vector $n_0$. To this end we shall use the averaging formulas
which can be straightforwardly checked
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \langle n_0^in_0^j\rangle&
  =\frac1{4\pi}\int d\Theta d\Phi\,{\sf\,sin\,}\Theta n_0^in_0^j=\frac13delta^{ij},
\\
  \langle n_0^in_0^jn_0^kn_0^l\rangle&
  =\frac1{4\pi}\int d\Theta d\Phi\,{\sf\,sin\,}\Theta n_0^in_0^jn_0^kn_0^l
  =\frac1{15}(delta^{ij}delta^{kl}+delta^{ik}delta^{jl}+delta^{il}delta^{jk}),
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $\Theta,\Phi$ are polar coordinates in the target space. After
averaging we get the new Lagrangian
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  \langle L_\mathrm{F}\rangle=&-\frac{m^2}3{\sf\,tr\,}(l_alpha l_alpha)
\\
  &-\frac1{15e^2}\left[\frac12{\sf\,tr\,}([l_alpha,l_beta][l_alpha,l_beta])
  -{\sf\,tr\,}^2(l_alpha l_alpha)+{\sf\,tr\,}^2(l_alpha l_beta)\right].
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
It contains two additional terms along with the Skyrme model ones
(\ref{eskact}).

Thus the averaging of ${\mathbb S}^2$-model over directions of vector $n_0$
yields the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model. Nonequivalence of these models will be
seen for static solutions considered in the following sections.

\section{Static solutions for the two-dimensional ${\mathbb S}^2$-model}
%********************************************************************
Unit vector $n$ in spherical coordinates is parametrized by two
angles $\Theta$ and $\Phi$
\begin{equation}                                        \label{epacsh}
  n^1={\sf\,sin\,}\Theta{\sf\,cos\,}\Phi,~~~~n^2={\sf\,sin\,}\Theta{\sf\,sin\,}\Phi,~~~~n^3={\sf\,cos\,}\Theta,
\end{equation}
describing two independent degrees of freedom. For simplicity we
shall analyze static solutions in the two-dimensional ${\mathbb S}^2$-model.
In this case the second term in the Lagrangian (\ref{ectmfi}) does
not contribute to the equations for static solutions. Therefore we
restrict ourselves by considering only the first term.

In angle variables the action corresponding to the first term in
(\ref{ectmfi}) takes the form
\begin{equation}                                        \label{ecphth}
  S=m^2\int dx(\partial_alpha\Theta^2+{\sf\,sin\,}^2\Theta\partial_alpha\Phi^2)
\end{equation}
and yields equations of motion
\begin{align}                                           \label{evarth}
  \frac1{m^2}\frac{delta S}{delta\Theta}=~~~~
  &-2\square\Theta+2{\sf\,sin\,}\Theta{\sf\,cos\,}\Theta\partial_alpha\Phi^2=0,
\\                                                      \label{evaphi}
  \frac1{m^2}\frac{delta S}{delta\Phi}=~~~~
  &-2\partial_alpha(\partial_alpha\Phi{\sf\,sin\,}^2\Theta)=0,
\end{align}
where $\square=\partial_alpha\partial_alpha$ is the d'Alembert operator.

Let us consider a two-dimensional Minkowskian space ${\mathbb R}^{1,1}$ with
Cartesian coordinates $t,x$ and analyze static solutions. For
$\Theta=\Theta(x)$ and $\Phi=\Phi(x)$ equations of motion (\ref{evarth}),
(\ref{evaphi}) take the form
\begin{align}                                           \label{estthe}
  \Theta''-{\sf\,sin\,}\Theta{\sf\,cos\,}\Theta\Phi^{\prime 2}&=0,
\\                                                      \label{estphi}
  \left(\Phi'{\sf\,sin\,}^2\Theta\right)'&=0.
\end{align}
where prime denotes differentiation with respect to $x$. We consider
solutions of the system of ordinary differential equations in the class
of two-times differentiable functions ${\cal C}^2(L)$ on a finite interval
$x\in[0,L]$. Any solution of this system of equations belongs to one
of the following four classes. Below constants of integration are
denoted by $b,c,x_0$ and $\Phi_0$.

{\bf Degenerate solutions I.}
\begin{equation}                                        \label{efideg}
  \Theta=0,~~~~\Phi(x)\in{\cal C}(L).
\end{equation}
In this case vector $n$ is directed along $Z$ axis, and there is no rotation.

{\bf Degenerate solutions II.}
\begin{equation}                                        \label{esedeg}
  \Theta=\frac\pi2,~~~~\Phi=b(x+x_0).
\end{equation}
Here vector $n$ uniformly rotates in the $X,Y$ plane as it goes along
$x$ coordinate.

{\bf Degenerate solutions III.}
\begin{equation}                                        \label{ethdeg}
  \Theta=b(x+x_0),~~~~\Phi=\Phi_0.
\end{equation}
Here vector $n$ uniformly rotates in the $\Phi=\Phi_0$ plane as it goes
along $x$. These solutions in essence coincide with degenerate solutions II.
To show this one can use the freedom in choosing a coordinate system in the
target space and choose the new axis $Z'$ perpendicular to the plane
$\Phi=\Phi_0$. Then degenerate solutions III transform to degenerate
solutions II.

{\bf A general situation.}
In this case equation (\ref{estphi}) has a solution
\begin{equation}                                       \label{ephpti}
  \Phi'{\sf\,sin\,}^2\Theta=c,~~~~c\ne0.
\end{equation}
Then equation (\ref{estthe}) takes the form
\begin{equation*}
  \Theta''=c^2\frac{{\sf\,cos\,}\Theta}{{\sf\,sin\,}^3\Theta}.
\end{equation*}
It is easily integrated
\begin{equation}                                       \label{esolth}
  {\sf\,cos\,}\Theta=\sqrt{1-\frac{c^2}{b^2}}{\sf\,sin\,}[b(x+x_0)],~~~~|b|>|c|.
\end{equation}
After that we integrate equation (\ref{ephpti})
\begin{equation}                                        \label{esophi}
  {\sf\,tg\,}(\Phi+\Phi_0)=\frac cb{\sf\,tg\,}[b(x+x_0)].
\end{equation}
Thus formulas (\ref{esolth}), (\ref{esophi}) yield static solutions in
a general situation. Constants of integration $x_0$ and $\Phi_0$
correspond to shifts of coordinates and may be set to zero for simplicity.
Constant $b$ corresponds to choosing of a scale of $x$ coordinate.
For fixed length $L$ of the interval it can not be changed. Note that
degenerate solutions II are obtained from a general situation in the
limit $|b|=|c|$.

One can show that in a general situation vector $n$ uniformly rotates
in the plane tilted at the angle ${\sf\,arctg\,}\sqrt{c^2-1}$ to the $X,Y$
plane as it moves along $x$. This means that we have in fact only two
essentially different
solutions of the Euler--Lagrange equations. First, there are degenerate
solutions I when vector $n$ does not change in its way along $x$.
Second, all other solutions describe uniform rotation of vector $n$ in
arbitrarily fixed plane. In this case the rotational axis is always
perpendicular to vector $n$. Division of these solutions into degenerate
ones and a general situation is related to the orientation of coordinate
system with respect to the rotational plane. Note that in all cases
orientation of Cartesian coordinates axes $X,Y,Z$ in the target space
can be arbitrary with respect to space coordinate $x$.

All obtained solutions to the ${\mathbb S}^2$-model are homotopic to zero because
the fundamental group is trivial $\pi({\mathbb S}^2)=0$. It means that there is
no one-dimensional topologically nontrivial solutions in ${\mathbb S}^2$-models.

Energy of two-dimensional ${\mathbb S}^2$-model for static solutions is equal to
\begin{equation*}
  E=\int_0^L dx\left(\Theta^{\prime2}+{\sf\,sin\,}^2\Theta\Phi^{\prime2}\right).
\end{equation*}
Straightforward substitution of solutions into this integral yields the
following values
\begin{equation*}
  E=\left\lbrace
\begin{aligned}
  0, &~~~~\text{degenerate solutions I},
\\
  b^2L,&~~~~\text{all other solutions}.
\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation*}
So the energy of static solutions is finite for finite $L$. For
$bL=2\pi m$, $m=1,2,\dotsc$ solutions are periodic. In this case they
may be considered as given on a circle.

Let us analyze the stability of the obtained solutions. The second
variation of the energy has the form
\begin{equation*}
  delta^2 E=\int_0^Ldx\left(delta\Theta^{\prime2}
  +{\sf\,cos\,}(2\Theta)\Phi^{\prime2}delta\Theta^2
  +2{\sf\,sin\,}(2\Theta)\Phi'delta\Thetadelta\Phi'
  +{\sf\,sin\,}^2\Thetadelta\Phi^{\prime2}\right).
\end{equation*}
Here variations $delta\Theta,delta\Theta',delta\Phi$ è $delta\Phi'$ have to be
considered as independent functions. A simple analysis shows that
degenerate solutions I yield the absolute minimum, and the remaining
solutions correspond to saddle points.

The Euler--Lagrange equations for ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ Skyrme model (\ref{elaomn})
have the form
\begin{align}                                               \nonumber
  &\frac{delta S}{delta\omega}=

\\                                                         \nonumber
  &\frac{delta S}{delta k_i}=

\\                                                        \nonumber
  &-4\kappa(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)^2\left[(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)\square k^i
  +(\partial_{alphabeta}^2k\partial_beta k)\partial_alpha k^i
  -(\square k\partial_alpha k)\partial_alpha k^i
  -(\partial_alpha k\partial_beta k)\partial_{alphabeta}^2k^i\right]
\\                                                        \nonumber
  &-8\kappa(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega){\sf\,sin\,}\omega\left[(\partial_beta k\partial_beta k)\partial_alpha k^i
  -(\partial_alpha k\partial_beta k)\partial_beta k^i\right]\partial_alpha\omega
\\                                                        \nonumber
  &-2\kappa(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)\left[(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)\partial_beta\omega^2
  -(\partial_alpha k\partial_beta k)\partial_alpha\omega\partial_beta\omega\right]k^i
\\                                                    \label{esenie}
  &-4\kappa(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)^2
  \left[(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)^2-(\partial_alpha k\partial_beta k)^2\right]k^i=0.
\end{align}
For variations of the action with respect to $k_i$ we used the formulae
which takes into account the constraint $(k,k)=1$,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{delta S}{delta k_i}=\frac{\bardelta S}{\bardelta k_j}(delta^i_j-k^ik_j),
\end{equation*}
where the variation in the right hand side is taken without constraint.

One easily checks that for static solutions $\omega(x)$, $k^i(x)$ in
two-dimensional Minkowskian space-time ${\mathbb R}^{1,1}$ all terms depending
on the coupling constant $\kappa$ are cancelled. It means that for the
analysis of one-dimensional static solutions in the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model
one may consider the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}                                        \label{elalth}
  L=\varrho\left[\frac12\partial_alpha\omega^2
  +(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)\left(\partial_alpha\theta^2+{\sf\,sin\,}^2\theta\partial_alpha\varphi^2\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where we used the spherical coordinates in the target space
\begin{equation}                                        \label{epacsn}
  k^1={\sf\,sin\,}\theta{\sf\,cos\,}\varphi,~~~~k^2={\sf\,sin\,}\theta{\sf\,sin\,}\varphi,~~~~k^3={\sf\,cos\,}\theta.
\end{equation}
We use lower case Greek letters for angle coordinates of unit vector $k$
to distinguish it from vector $n$ considered in the previous section.

Equations of motion in the static case are
\begin{align}                                           \label{eqomeg}
  \frac1\varrho\frac{delta S}{delta\omega}=~~~~
  &-\omega''+{\sf\,sin\,}\omega(\theta^{\prime2}+{\sf\,sin\,}^2\theta\varphi^{\prime2})=0,
\\                                                      \label{eqthet}
  \frac1\varrho\frac{delta S}{delta\theta}=~~~~
  &-2\left((1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)\theta'\right)'
  +2(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega){\sf\,sin\,}\theta{\sf\,cos\,}\theta\varphi^{\prime2}=0,
\\                                                      \label{eqphil}
  \frac1\varrho\frac{delta S}{delta\varphi}=~~~~
  &-2\left((1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega){\sf\,sin\,}^2\theta\varphi'\right)'=0.
\end{align}
We look for solutions of this system of differential equations in the
function space ${\cal C}^2(L)$. Any solution of the system of equations
(\ref{eqomeg})--(\ref{eqphil}) belongs to one of the following five classes.
Below constants of integration are denoted by $a,b,c,x_0,\varphi_0,\theta_0,$
and $u_0$.

{\bf Degenerate solutions I}.
In this case the rotational angle is a linear function
\begin{equation*}
  \omega=b(x+x_0),
\end{equation*}
and the rotational axis is fixed
\begin{equation*}
  \theta=\theta_0,~~\varphi=\varphi_0,~~~~\text{or}~~~~\theta=0,~~\varphi(x)\in{\cal C}^2(L).
\end{equation*}
For this solution the vector $n^i=n_0^jS_j{}^i(\omega)$ uniformly rotates
around $k$ which may have arbitrary direction as it moves along $x$. In
contrast to the ${\mathbb S}^2$-model the vector $n$ is not necessarily perpendicular
to the rotational axis.

Degenerate solutions I yield an example of static topologically nontrivial
solutions with topological charge 0 or 1. If the angle $\omega$ varies within
an interval divisible by $4\pi$ then the topological charge is zero because
the corresponding contour can be always deformed continuously to a point.
The related deformation of the contour for $0<\omega<4\pi$ is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fsohom}.
\begin{figure}[htb]%-------------------------------------------------
 \begin{center} \leavevmode \epsfysize=40mm
 \epsfbox{so3hom.eps}
 \end{center}
 \caption{The continuous deformation of the contour $0<\omega<4\pi$ to a point.
 The deformation is shown in the plane going through the vector $k$ defining
 the rotation axis. Identification of antipodal points on the boundary
 circle is shown by dashed lines.
 \label{fsohom}}
\end{figure}%---------------------------------------------------------
If the angle $\omega$ takes values in an interval containing the interval
$2\pi$ odd number of times then the topological charge equals 1.

{\bf Degenerate solutions II}.
\begin{equation}                                        \label{ethisk}
  \omega=0,~~\theta(x),\varphi(x)\in{\cal C}^2(L).
\end{equation}
Rotation does not take place for this series of solutions because the
angle of rotation equals zero.

{\bf Degenerate solutions III}.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  {\sf\,cos\,}\frac\omega2&=\sqrt{1-\frac{c^2}{4b^2}}{\sf\,sin\,}[b(x+x_0)],~~~~2|b|\ge|c|\ne0,
\\
  \theta&=\frac\pi2,
\\
  {\sf\,tg\,}(\varphi+\varphi_0)&=\frac c{2b}{\sf\,tg\,}[b(x+x_0)].
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Polar angle $\varphi$ is a monotonic function of $x$ for these solutions,
that is the rotational axis $k^i$ rotates in the $X,Y$ plane. Here
the rotational angle changes inside the finite interval
\begin{equation*}
  2{\sf\,arccos\,}\sqrt{1-\frac{c^2}{4b^2}}<\omega
  <2\pi-2{\sf\,arccos\,}\sqrt{1-\frac{c^2}{4b^2}}.
\end{equation*}
It can be easily checked that these solutions are homotopic to zero.

{\bf Degenerate solutions IV}.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  {\sf\,cos\,}\frac\omega2&=\sqrt{1-\frac{c^2}{4b^2}}{\sf\,sin\,}[b(x+x_0)],~~~~2|b|\ge|c|\ne0,
\\
  {\sf\,tg\,}(\theta+\theta_0)&=\frac c{2b}{\sf\,tg\,}[b(x+x_0)],
\\
  \varphi&=\varphi_0.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
These solutions coincide essentially with degenerate solutions III,
but the rotational axis rotates in the $\varphi=\varphi_0$ plane.

{\bf A general situation}.
To solve the system of equations (\ref{eqomeg})--(\ref{eqphil}) in a
general situation we introduce new coordinate
\begin{equation}                                      \label{eintux}
  u=\int^x\frac{dy}{1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega(y)}.
\end{equation}
The coordinate $u$ increases with increasing of $x$ because
$dx/du=1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega\ge0$. Then equations for $\theta$ and $\varphi$ (\ref{eqthet}),
(\ref{eqphil}) coincide exactly with equations for $\Theta$ and $\Phi$
(\ref{estthe}), (\ref{estphi}), in which differentiation with respect to
$x$ has to be changed to the differentiation with respect to $u$. Since
these equations were analyzed in the previous section, we are left with
solution of equation (\ref{eqomeg}) only. In a general situation it takes
the form
\begin{equation}                                        \label{eqomca}
  \omega''=c^2\frac{{\sf\,sin\,}\omega}{(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)^2},~~~~c\ne0.
\end{equation}
A general solution of this equation has the form
\begin{equation}                                        \label{eqomxc}
  {\sf\,cos\,}\frac\omega2=\sqrt{1-\frac{c^2}{4b^2}}{\sf\,sin\,}[b(x+x_0)],~~~~2|b|\ge|c|.
\end{equation}
After that the integral (\ref{eintux}) can be easily taken
\begin{equation}                                        \label{ethuxc}
  {\sf\,tg\,}(cu)=\frac c{2b}{\sf\,tg\,}[b(x+x_0)],
\end{equation}
where a constant of integration is inessential.
A solution of equations (\ref{eqthet}), (\ref{eqphil}) has the form
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  {\sf\,cos\,}\theta&=\sqrt{1-\frac{a^2}{c^2}}{\sf\,sin\,}[c(u+u_0)],~~~~|c|>|a|\ne0,
\\
  {\sf\,tg\,}(\varphi+\varphi_0)&=\frac ac{\sf\,tg\,}[c(u+u_0)].
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Elementary geometrical analysis shows that solutions in a general situation
coincide in essence with degenerate solutions III and IV, but the rotational
axis rotates in the plane tilted at the angle ${\sf\,arccos\,}(a/c)$ to the $X,Y$
plane.

For static solutions the energy of two-dimensional ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model is
equal to
\begin{equation*}
  E=\int_0^L dx\left(\frac12\omega^{\prime2}+(1-{\sf\,cos\,}\omega)
  \left(\theta^{\prime2}+{\sf\,sin\,}^2\theta\varphi^{\prime2}\right)\right).
\end{equation*}
Straightforward substitution of the solutions into this integral yields
the following values
\begin{equation*}
  E=\left\lbrace
\begin{aligned}
  0, &~~~~\text{degenerate solutions II},
\\
  \frac12b^2L, &~~~~\text{degenerate solutions I},
\\
  2b^2L,&~~~~\text{all other solutions}.
\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation*}
The energy is finite for finite $L$. Degenerate solutions II correspond
to absolute minimum because the energy is positive definite.

\section{Projective ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d$-models}
%********************************************************************
The Lagrangian for the Skyrme model written in the form (\ref{elaomn})
can be naturally generalized to the case when the target space is
a real projective space of arbitrary dimension ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d$. Let $k^i$,
$i=1,\dotsc,d$ be a unit vector $k^2=1$ in the Euclidean space ${\mathbb R}^d$.
Consider a vector $k^i(x)$ and a scalar $\omega(x)$ fields on an arbitrary
Minkowskian space $x\in{\mathbb R}^{1,n-1}$. Obviously, the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}                                        \label{elagep}
\begin{split}
  L=A\partial_alpha\omega^2+B(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)
  +C(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)\partial_beta\omega^2
  +D&(\partial_alpha k\partial_beta k)\partial_alpha\omega\partial_beta\omega
\\
  +E(\partial_alpha k\partial_alpha k)^2+F&(\partial_alpha k\partial_beta k)^2+G(\partial_alpha\omega^2)^2+U,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $A(\omega),B(\omega),C(\omega),D(\omega),E(\omega),F(\omega),G(\omega),U(\omega)$ are
arbitrary periodic (with period $2\pi$) functions on $\omega$ is invariant
with respect to the transformations (\ref{einomn}). One can introduce
a vector field $\omega^i=\omega k^i$ all components of which are independent
as happen in the Skyrme model. Due to the equivalence relation
(\ref{eqrsog}) a vector field $\omega^i$ can be considered as taking values
inside a ball of radius $\pi$ with identified antipodal points on the
boundary sphere. It means that the field $\omega^i$ takes values in an
arbitrary projective space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d$.

It is the most general invariant Lagrangian depending only on first
derivatives to a power not exceeding four. It is invariant with respect
to the Poicar\'e group ${\mathbb I}{\mathbb O}(1,n-1)$ acting in Minkowskian space
${\mathbb R}^{1,n-1}$, rotational group ${\mathbb O}(d)$ acting in the target space
${\mathbb R}^d$, and translations (\ref{einomn}). The rotational group ${\mathbb O}(d)$
can be extended to the group ${\mathbb O}(d+1)$ (maximal symmetry group of the
projective space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d$) but additional transformations will act
nonlinearly on fields $\omega^i$.

We considered the Skyrme model as a ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model where the target
space is the group manifold by itself using the explicit parametrization
of the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ group by elements of its algebra. Since the
fundamental group of the rotational group is nontrivial
$\pi({\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3))={\mathbb Z}_2$ the model admits existence of one-dimensional
topologically nontrivial solutions. Corresponding static solutions in the
two-dimensional Skyrme model are found and analyzed (degenerate
solutions I from section 7).

The form of the action for ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$ and ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ Skyrme models
coincides because their Lie algebras are isomorphic. The difference
is in the equivalence relations in the parameter space. Hence to
construct models in mathematical physics one must specify what
manifold is a target space besides the action. This is important
because topologically nontrivial solutions of Euler--Lagrange
equations may arise. For example, in considering spinors on
three-dimensional Riemannian manifold the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-connection enters
the covariant derivative in spite of the fact that spinors transform
under the representation of unitary ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$ group. It is because
the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ group but not ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb U}(2)$ acts on an orthogonal vielbein
in the tangent space to a Riemannian manifold.

The ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model can be naturally generalized to a projective
space of arbitrary dimension ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d$ because the group ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$
as a manifold is diffeomorphic to a three-dimensional real projective
space ${\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^3$. This allows one to define a new class of projective
models depending on eight arbitrary periodic functions of one argument.
There is a possibility of existence of one-dimensional topologically
nontrivial solutions in all these models since $\pi({\mathbb R}{\mathbb P}^d)={\mathbb Z}_2$
for $d\ge2$.

The ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model may be used in the geometric theory of defects
\cite{KatVol92,KatVol99}. The Riemann--Cartan geometry is used to
describe static distribution of dislocations and disclinations in
elastic media. The corresponding action is invariant under general
coordinate transformations and local ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ rotations. Recently
the equations of elasticity theory were used to fix the coordinate
system \cite{Katana03}. This allowed to include the classical elasticity
theory in the geometric approach as a limiting case for the absence of
defects. The ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model discussed in the present paper can be used
to fix local ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$ rotations because it is not invariant under these
transformations. In this case the geometric theory of defects will yield
the ${\mathbb S}{\mathbb O}(3)$-model in the absence of disclinations.
