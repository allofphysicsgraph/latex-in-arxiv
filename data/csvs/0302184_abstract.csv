 Within a broad  class of inflationary 
models we critically analyse  the way initial quantum
fluctuations on a new-physics hypersurface (NPH) affect
standard predictions for
large-scale cosmological perturbations. We find that
these so-called transplanckian effects crucially depend  
on the definition of the  ``vacuum state"" in particular
on which Hamiltonian is minimized on the NPH in order to select such a state. 
Transplanckian effects can be made much smaller than
previously suggested if sufficiently ``adiabatic"" Hamiltonians are minimized.
