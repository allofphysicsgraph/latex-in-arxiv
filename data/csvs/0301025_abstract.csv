of normalizable modes, usually called regular and irregular modes. The
regular one is easily taken into account in the standard prescription
for the AdS/CFT correspondence. The irregular mode requires a
modified prescription which we argue is not completely
satisfactory. We discuss an alternative quantization in AdS which
incorporates boundary terms in a natural way. Within this quantization
scheme we present an improved prescription for the AdS/CFT 
correspondence which can be applied to both, regular and irregular
modes. Boundary conditions other than Dirichlet are naturally treated
in this new improved setting.
