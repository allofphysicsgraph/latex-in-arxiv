Noncommutative $U({\cal N})$ 
gauge theories at different ${\cal N}$ may be often thought of as different
sectors of a single theory: the $U(1)$ theory possesses a
sequence of vacua labeled by an integer parameter ${\cal N}$, and 
the theory in the vicinity of the ${\cal N}$-th vacuum coincides
with the $U({\cal N})$ noncommutative gauge theory. 
%in the vicinity of
%the trivial vacuum of the latter.
We construct noncommutative domain walls on fuzzy cylinder,
separating vacua with different gauge
theories. These domain
walls are solutions of BPS equations in gauge theory with an extra
term stabilizing the radius of the cylinder. We study properties of
the domain walls using adjoint scalar and fundamental fermion fields
as probes. We show that the regions on different sides of the wall
are not disjoint even in the low energy regime --- there are modes 
penetrating from one region to the other. We find that the wall
supports a chiral fermion zero mode. Also, we study non-BPS solution
representing a wall and an antiwall, and show that this solution is
unstable. We suggest that the domain
walls emerge as solutions of matrix model in large class of pp-wave
backgrounds with inhomogeneous field strength. In the M-theory language,
the domain walls have an interpretation of a stack of branes of
fingerstall shape inserted into a stack of cylindrical branes.
