We investigate the fermionic sector of a given theory, in which massive and
charged Dirac fermions interact with an Abelian gauge field, including a
non standard contribution that violates both Lorentz and CPT symmetries.
We offer an explicit calculation in which the radiative corrections due to
the fermions seem to generate a Chern-Simons-like effective action. Our
results are obtained under the general guidance of dimensional regularization,
and they show that there is no room for Lorentz and CPT violation in both
commutative and noncommutative spacetime.
