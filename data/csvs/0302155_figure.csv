\caption{\protect\small The entropy/energy ratios for our configuration,
in the two different regimes of $\mu _{eff}$, namely $0<\mu _{eff}^{2}<1$
 (long dash curve) and $-1<\mu _{eff}^{2}<0$  (short dash curve), as 
compared with the conformal case (thin full line) and with the  Bekenstein 
and Verlinde  bounds (thicker line and second thicker one,
respectively).}
