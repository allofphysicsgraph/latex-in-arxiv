{The renormalization-group functions of the two-dimensional 
$n$-vector $\lambda \phi^4$ model are calculated in the five-loop 
approximation. Perturbative series for the $\beta$-function and 
critical exponents are resummed by the Pade-Borel-Leroy techniques. 
An account for the five-loop term shifts the Wilson fixed point 
location only briefly, leaving it outside the segment formed by 
the results of the lattice calculations. This is argued to reflect 
the influence of the non-analytical contribution to the 
$\beta$-function. The evaluation of the critical exponents for 
$n = 1$, $n = 0$ and $n = -1$ in the five-loop approximation and 
comparison of the results with known exact values confirm the 
conclusion that non-analytical contributions are visible in two 
dimensions. For the $2D$ Ising model, the estimate 
$\omega = 1.31(3)$ for the correction-to-scaling exponent is 
found that is close to the values resulting from the 
high-temperature expansions.}
