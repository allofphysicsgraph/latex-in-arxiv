  We discuss properties of a 4-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole in
  a spacetime where one of the spatial dimensions is compactified. As a
  result of the compactification the event horizon of the black hole is
  distorted. We use Weyl coordinates to obtain the solution describing
  such a distorted black hole. We study the properties of the
  compactified Schwarzschild black hole, and develop an approximation
  which allows one to find the size, shape, surface gravity and other
  characteristics of the distorted horizon with a very high accuracy in
  a simple analytical form. We also discuss possible instabilities of a
  black hole in the compactified space.
