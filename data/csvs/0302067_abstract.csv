We present an exact solution for a factorizable brane-world spacetime
with two extra dimensions and explicit brane sources.  The
compactification manifold has the topology of a two-sphere, and is
stabilized by a bulk cosmological constant and magnetic flux.  The
geometry of the sphere is locally round except for conical
singularities at the locations of two antipodal branes, deforming the
sphere into an American-style football.  The bulk magnetic flux needs
to be fine-tuned to obtain flat geometry on the branes.  Once this is
done, the brane geometry is insensitive to the brane vacuum energy,
which only affects the conical deficit angle of the extra dimensions.
Solutions of this form provide a new arena in which to explore
brane-world phenomenology and the effects of extra dimensions on the
cosmological constant problem.
