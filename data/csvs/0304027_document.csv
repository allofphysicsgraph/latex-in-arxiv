\begin{abstract}
Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) is a class of theories of
relativistic motion with two observer-independent scales. We
investigate the velocity of particles in DSR, defining velocity as
the Poisson bracket of position with the appropriate hamiltonian,
taking care of the non-trivial structure of the DSR phase space.
We find the general expression for four-velocity, and  we show
further that the three-velocity of massless particles equals 1 for
all DSR theories. The relation between the boost parameter and
velocity is also clarified.

\section{Introduction}

There is a rapidly growing interest in a research programme, which
might be called ``Quantum Special Relativity'', i.e. a class of
theories of kinematics that differ in their predictions from that
of Special Relativity in the regime of ultra-high energies. These
possible differences might be understood as traces of still
unknown Quantum Gravity theory present even in the regime of
negligible gravitational field. It is feasible that predictions of
such generalizations of Special Relativity, like dependence of the
speed of massless particles on momentum they carry, might be
experimentally tested in the near future experiments.

Two alternative classes of ``Quantum Special Relativity'' have
been recently attracting  attention. In one, one argues that
Lorentz invariance is broken at high energies due to string
\cite{Colladay:1998fq}, loop-quantum gravity \cite{Gambini:1998it}
effects, or due to existence of the cosmological preferred frame
\cite{Jacobson:2001yj}. In the second, proposed by Amelino-Camelia
\cite{Amelino-Camelia:2000ge}, \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2000mn},
called Doubly Special Relativity (DSR), one assumes that the ten
dimensional algebra of physical symmetries (rotations, boosts, and
translations) is still present, but is deformed in a way so as to
possess two observer-independent scales. In this paper we will
concentrate on this second possibility only.

The construction of the first specific model of DSR, called DSR1, presented in
\cite{Kowalski-Glikman:2001gp} and \cite{Bruno:2001mw} borrowed a lot from the
earlier investigations in quantum Hopf deformations of Poincar\'e algebra, the
so-called $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra (see e.g., \cite{lunoruto}, \cite{maru}).
It turned out however that there exist another DSR models: the first one,
called nowadays DSR2 was formulated by Magueijo and Smolin
\cite{Magueijo:2001cr}, and it was soon realized that there exist a whole class
of DSR theories \cite{Kowalski-Glikman:2002we}, \cite{Kowalski-Glikman:2002jr}.

In the majority  of the (especially early) literature devoted to
DSR, Doubly Special Relativity is defined only as a theory based
on energy-momentum sector. This is {\em not} what we understand by
DSR in this paper. In our view, a DSR theory is defined by a set
of commutators describing the whole of the phase space of the
system. There are two systematic and equivalent ways of deriving
such a set in any particular model\footnote{Some other methods of
deriving consistent phase space may exist, of course. We are not
aware however of any nontrivial alternative to the procedure we
make use of.}. The first is based on the Hopf algebra structure
that can be built on the energy--momentum algebra, and the use of
the so called Heisenberg double construction \cite{luno},
\cite{crossalg},
 \cite{Kowalski-Glikman:2002jr}. Equivalently, one can get the same
phase space by making use of the geometric, de Sitter picture of DSR,
\cite{Kowalski-Glikman:2002ft}, \cite{jsnew}.
\newline

Doubly Special Relativity is a theory of particle kinematics, and the proper
understanding of the concept of velocity in such a theory is of course an
important step towards full understanding of it. The first attempt to analyze
the notion of velocity has been made already in the early days of the
$\kappa$-Poincar\'e theory in \cite{Lukierski:1993wx}, from the DSR perspective
this problem has been investigated, among others, in
\cite{Kowalski-Glikman:2001px}, \cite{Lukierski:2002fd},
\cite{Amelino-Camelia:2002tc}, \cite{Kosinski:2002gu}, \cite{mignemi2003}.

The starting point of our investigations reported here consists of
two major assumptions: that velocity is defined as the Poisson
bracket of position with deformed relativistic hamiltonian (see
also \cite{Lukierski:1993wx}), and that to compute this bracket
one must take into account the nontrivial phase space structure of
DSR theories.  We show that in all DSR theories four velocities
transform as  standard Lorentz vectors, and that the three
velocities of massless particles equal one. This general statement
will be justified in Section 3; before turning to that, we present
our method on the specific example of DSR1.

\section{Particle velocity in DSR1}


Before starting our investigations let us state clearly what our
assumptions are. We define four velocity as the Poisson bracket,
based on a DSR phase space structure, of positions with an
appropriate hamiltonian. Let us explain why we decided to use
Poisson brackets instead of commutators, usually employed in the
DSR literature. The reason is quite simple: the use of commutators
implies that the relevant objects are operators acting on some
Hilbert space. Since no investigations of such operators'
properties  (functional analysis) has been performed so far,
working with the commutator algebra is equivalent to phrasing
results in terms of Poisson brackets. Since we will make use of
the expression for three-velocity as a function of four velocities
$v^i = {\dot x}^i/{\dot x}^0$ whose meaning for $x^0$ being an
operator is not clear, it is just safer to work with Poisson
brackets. For this reason we will confirm our discussion to
classical particles and not quantum matter waves. In our
investigations in this section we will also postulate a particular
form of relativistic hamiltonian. We will argue that such form is
natural in the next section devoted to general properties shared
by all DSR theories.

In all the DSR theories (contrary to the statements that can be sometimes found
in the literature), the Lorentz algebra of rotations $M_i$ and boosts $N_i$ is
exactly the same as in Special Relativity\footnote{Let us stress again that
$[\ast,\ast]$ denotes the Poisson bracket and {\em not} the commutator.}
$$
[M_i, M_j] =  \epsilon_{ijk} M_k, \quad [M_i, N_j] =  \epsilon_{ijk} N_k,
$$
\begin{equation}\label{1}
  [N_i, N_j] = - \epsilon_{ijk} M_k,
\end{equation}

In the DSR1 theory the momenta transform under action of boosts as follows
\begin{equation}\label{2}
   \left[N_{i}, p_{j}\right] =   \delta_{ij}
 \left( {\kappa\over 2} \left(
 1 -e^{-2{p_{0}/ \kappa}}
\right) + {1\over 2\kappa} \vec{p}\,{}^{ 2}\, \right) -  {1\over \kappa}
p_{i}p_{j} ,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{3}
  \left[N_{i},p_{0}\right] =  p_{i}.
\end{equation}
The first Casimir of this theory equals
\begin{equation}\label{4}
{\cal C}  = \left(2\kappa \sinh \left(\frac{p_0}{2\kappa}\right)\right)^2 -
\vec{p}\,{}^2\, e^{p_0/\kappa}=m^2.
\end{equation}
Let us now turn to description of the phase space of DSR1. As for all DSR
theories we have
\begin{equation}\label{5}
  [x_0, x_i] = -\frac{1}{\kappa}\, x_i, \quad [x_i, x_j] = 0.
\end{equation}
As shown in \cite{jsnew} there are infinitely many phase spaces compatible with
the DSR1 boost transformations (\ref{3}), (\ref{4}) and the brackets (\ref{5}).
Here we will describe only the two most simple ones for whose the cross
brackets take the following form
$$ [p_0,
x_0] = -1, \quad [p_i, x_0] =  \frac{1}\kappa\, p_i,
$$
\begin{equation}\label{6}
[p_i, x_j] =  \delta_{ij} \, e^{- 2p_0/\kappa}
-\frac{1}{\kappa^2}\left(\vec{p}\,{}^{ 2}\, \delta_{ij} - 2 p_{i}p_{j}\right),
\quad [p_0, x_i] = -\frac{2}\kappa\, p_i
\end{equation}
or, following \cite{maru}, \cite{Lukierski:1993wx}
\begin{equation}\label{6a}
  [p_0, x_0] = 1, \quad [p_i, x_0] =  -\frac{1}\kappa\, p_i, \quad [p_i, x_j] =-
 \delta_{ij} , \quad [p_0, x_i] =0.
\end{equation}
We choose the hamiltonian to be
\begin{equation}\label{7} { \cal H} =
\kappa^2\, \cosh \frac{p_0}\kappa  - \frac{\vec{p}\,{}^2}{2} \, e^{
\frac{p_0}\kappa}.
\end{equation}
This hamiltonian has the large $\kappa$ limit
$$
{ \cal H} \sim \kappa^2 +\frac12\left(p^2_0 -\vec{p}\,{}^2\right) + \ldots
$$
i.e., it reduces in this limit to the standard hamiltonian of relativistic
particle (up to the irrelevant constant shift). Let us now define the four
velocities in the standard way as the bracket
\begin{equation}\label{8}
 u_0 \equiv  \dot x_0 =  [x_0,{\cal H}], \quad u_i \equiv  \dot x_i =  [x_i,{\cal H}]
\end{equation}
In calculating the brackets in (\ref{8}) one should carefully take care of the
nontrivial phase space structure of DSR1 (\ref{6}) or (\ref{6a}) (in accordance
with the scheme presented in \cite{Lukierski:1993wx})
$$
  [x_0,{\cal H}] \equiv "
