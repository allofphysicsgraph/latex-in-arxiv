Symmetry breaking can produce ``Alice'' strings, which alter scattered
charges and carry monopole number and charge when twisted into loops.
We apply recent topological results, fixing Alice strings' stability
and prescribing their twisting into loops with monopole charge, to
several models.  We show that Alice strings of condensed matter
systems (nematic liquid crystals, $^3$He-A, and related systems of
non-chiral Bose condensates and amorphous chiral superconductors) are
topological, and carry fundamental monopole charge when twisted into
loops. Other models yield Alice loops that carry only deposited, and not
fundamental, charge.
