{\small
We study $SUSY-$intertwining for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with
special emphasis to the two-dimensional generalized Morse potential,
which does not allow for separation of variables. The complexified
methods of $SUSY-$separation of variables and two-dimensional shape
invariance are used to construct particular solutions - both for
complex conjugated energy pairs and for non-paired complex energies.
