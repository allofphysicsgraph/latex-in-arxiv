\item 
First of all, the untwisted bulk gaugino states lead to localized
anomalies at the fixed points of $T^6/\Intr_3$. These anomalies are
entirely determined by the local spectra of those untwisted states, that
survive the orbifold projections at the corresponding fixed points. By taking 
the twisted states at the fixed points into account, we showed that
no non--Abelian anomalies arise at any of the fixed points. 
\item 
However, the structure of the localized anomalous $\U{1}$'s turned out
to be more complicated. Using the fact that the spectrum of a model
with Wilson lines at each fixed point is equivalent to the spectrum
of a model without Wilson lines, it followed, that at most
one of essentially two types of anomalous $\U{1}$'s can be present
locally at each fixed point. The sum of the local anomalous $\U{1}$ generators
corresponds to the possible anomalous $\U{1}$ generator of the zero
mode theory. If this sum vanishes, no anomalous $\U{1}$ appears at the
zero mode level.
