\item  If $\left\| c\right\| =0$, there are three first class constraints, $%
\pi \approx 0$, $f\approx 0$ and $\chi \approx 0$, which means that the
system has $N-2$\ physical degrees of freedom. In this case, substitution of
(\ref{phi}) by the equivalent linear constraint (\ref{root}), yields a \emph{%
dynamically inequivalent} system.

\item  If $\left\| c\right\| \neq 0$, then $f\approx 0$ and $\chi \approx 0$
are second class, while $\pi \approx 0$ is first class, which leaves $N-1$
physical degrees of freedom\ and the substitution does not change the
dynamics of the system.

\item  Type I constraints are of the form $\phi =\prod f_{i}(z)$, where $%
f_{i}$ possess simple zeros. These constraints violate the regularity
conditions (RCs) on sets of measure zero on the constraint surface $\Sigma $.

\item  Type I constraints can be exchanged by equivalent constraints which
are regular giving an equivalent dynamical system.

\item  Type II constraints are of the form $\phi =f^{k}$ $(k>1)$ where $f$
has a simple zero. They violate the RCs on sets of nonzero measure on $%
\Sigma $.

\item  A type II constraint can be replaced by an equivalent linear one only
if the latter is second class; if the equivalent linear constraint is first
class, substituting it for the original constraint would change the system.

\item  In general, the orbits can cross the configurations where the RCs are
violated without any catastrophic effect for the system. If the symplectic
form degenerates at the irregular points, additional analysis is required.

\item  The naive linearized approximation of an irregular constrained system
generically changes it by erasing the irregular constraints. In order to
study the perturbations around a classical orbit in an irregular system, it
would be necessary to first regularize it (if possible) and only then do the
linearized approximation.

\item  Chern-Simons theories possess irregular and regular sectors. This
problem is independent of the presence of degeneracies in the symplectic
form, making the regularization problem much more complex.
