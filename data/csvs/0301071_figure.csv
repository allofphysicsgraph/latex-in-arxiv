\caption{Cuts in the $\lambda$- or ``eigenvalue"" plane for the
planar limit of 1-matrix model. The eigenvalues are supposed to be
located ``on"" the cuts. The distribution of eigenvalues is governed by the
period integrals ${\bf S} = \oint_{\bf A} \rho(\lambda)d\lambda$ along the
corresponding cycles
and the dependence of partition function on ``distributions"" $S_i$ is
given by the quasiclassical tau-function ${\d{\cal F}\over\d {\bf S}} =
\oint_{\bf B} \rho(\lambda)d\lambda$.
%In case of many variables the integrability condition follows from the Riemann
%bilinear relations for the first-kind and third-kind Abelian differentials.

\caption{Cut Riemann surface with boundary $\d\Sigma$. The integral over the
boundary can be divided into several pieces (see formula (\ref{derdpm})). In
the process of computation we use the fact that the boundary values of
Abelian integrals
$v_j^\pm$ on two copies of the cut differ by period integral of
the corresponding differential
$d\omega_j$ over the dual cycle.}
