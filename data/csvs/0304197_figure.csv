\caption{LH panel: The solution $T(x)$ of equation (\ref{v0}) for the potential
$V = e^{-T^2}$. As discussed in the text, the solutions are periodic and
their amplitude increases as $V_0$ decreases: the 3 curves correspond to
$V_0 = 0.5$ (green curve), $V_0=0.85$ (red curve), and $V_0=0.99$ (blue 
curve).  Note, as will be discussed later, that the wavelength of the solutions
decreases as $V_0$ decreases.  RH panel: the energy density $V^2/V_0$
corresponding to the 3 curves in the LH panel. The kinks and anti-kinks are 
labeled. Note that as $V_0$ decreases
the energy density in the kinks and anti-kinks have more
localised energy density.}

\caption{Schematic plots of $\zeta$ and $E_R$ as a function of
$V_0$.  In the RH panel, the values of $V_0$ are discrete 
due to the finite size $2\pi R$ of the circle: the exception is
the horizontal line which, in both panels, corresponds to the
potential $V=v/\cosh(\beta T)$.  When $V_0 \rightarrow 0$ and
$\zeta \rightarrow 0$ (red curves in both figures), the energy
diverges even for finite $R$ as seen in the RH panel: the lowest
energy state is the one with constant vanishing $T$ and hence no
kinks, as discussed in the text. Such a situation occurs for
potentials of the form $V \sim e^{-T^a}$, $(a>1)$.  If $\zeta
\rightarrow \infty$ as $V_0 \rightarrow 0$ (blue curves in both
figures), the lowest energy state has the lowest value of $V_0$
allowed for that $R$ and corresponds to a state with one kink and
anti-kink. In the limit $R \rightarrow \infty$, $V_0 \rightarrow
0$ its energy tends to $E_{\rm Sen}.$}
