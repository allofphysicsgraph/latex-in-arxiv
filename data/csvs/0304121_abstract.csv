All consistent interactions in a three-dimensional theory with tensor gauge
fields of degrees two and three are obtained by means of the deformation of
the solution to the master equation combined with cohomological techniques.
The local BRST cohomology of this model allows the deformation of the
Lagrangian action, accompanying gauge symmetries and gauge algebra. The
relationship with the Chern--Simons theory is discussed.
