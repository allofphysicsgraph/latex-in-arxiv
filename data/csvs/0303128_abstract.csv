  In this paper, starting from the common foundation of Connes'
noncommutative geometry ( NCG)\cite{Connes1, Connes2, Connes3,
CoLo}, various possible alternatives in the formulation of a
theory of gravity in noncommutative spacetime are discussed in
detail. The diversity in the final physical content of the theory
is shown to be the consequence of the arbitrariness in each
construction steps.
  As an alternative in the last step, when the structure equations
are to be solved, a minimal set of contraints on the torsion and
connection is found to determine all the geometric notions in
terms of metric. In the Connes-Lott model of noncommutative
spacetime, in order to keep the full spectrum of the discretized
Kaluza-Klein theory \cite{VW2}, it is necessary to include the
torsion in the generalized Einstein-Hilbert-Cartan action.
