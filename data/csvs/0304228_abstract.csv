The construction of dual theories for linearized gravity in four dimensions
is considered. Our approach is based on the parent Lagrangian method
previously developed for the massive spin-two case, but now considered for
the zero mass case. This leads to a dual theory described in terms of a rank
two symmetric tensor, analogous to the usual gravitational field, and an
auxiliary antisymmetric field. This theory has an enlarged gauge symmetry,
but with an adequate partial gauge fixing it can be reduced to a gauge
symmetry similar to the standard one of linearized gravitation. We present
examples illustrating the general procedure and the physical interpretation
of the dual fields. The zero mass case of the massive theory dual to the
massive spin-two theory is also examined, but we show that it only contains
a spin-zero excitation.
