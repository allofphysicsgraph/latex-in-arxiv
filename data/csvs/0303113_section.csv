\section{Conventions}
\label{sec-conventions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Greek indices $\mu,\nu,\rho,\ldots$ denote world tensor indices while 
Latin $a,b,c\ldots$ indices are tangent space indices.  We use hats for
11-dimensional objects and no hats for 8-dimensional objects. We
symmetrize and antisymmetrize with weight one.  Sometimes we use the
following convention: when indices are not shown explicitly, we assume
that all of them are world indices and all of them are completely
antisymmetrized in the obvious order. This is similar to
differential forms notation but the numerical factors differ.

We use mostly minus signature $(+-\cdots -)$\footnote{
  All formulae in this paragraph are valid both without and with hats.}. 
$\eta_{ab}$ is the Minkowski
spacetime metric and the spacetime metric is $g_{\mu \nu}$. Lorentz and world
indices are related by the Vielbeins $e_{a}{}^{\mu}$ and inverse
Vielbeins $e_{\mu}{}^{a}$, that satisfy
\begin{equation}
e_{a}{}^{\mu}e_{b}{}^{\nu}g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{ab}\, ,
\hspace{1cm}
e_{\mu}{}^{a}e_{\nu}{}^{b}\eta_{ab}=g_{\mu\nu}\, .  
\end{equation}
The spin connection $\omega_{abc}$ is defined by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:spincon}
\omega_{abc} = -\Omega_{abc}+\Omega_{bca} -\Omega_{cab}\, , \qquad
\Omega_{ab}{}^{c} = e_{a}{}^{\mu}e_{b}{}^{\nu} \partial_{[\mu}e^{c}{}_{\nu]}\, .
\end{align}
The Riemann curvature tensor is given in terms of the spin connection by
\begin{align}
R_{\mu\nu a}{}^{b} = 2\partial_{[\mu}\, \omega_{\nu] a}{}^{b} 
-2\omega_{[\mu| a}{}^{c}\,\omega_{|\nu]c}{}^{b}\, . 
\end{align}  

The 11-dimensional gamma matrices satisfy the anticommutation relations
\begin{equation}
\{ \hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{a}},
\hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{b}}\} =
+2\hat{\eta}{}^{\hat{a}\hat{b}}\, ,
\end{equation}
We choose them to satisfy
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{a}\, \star} = -\hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{a}} \,, \qquad
  \hat{\Gamma}{}^{0}\, \hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{a}}\,
  \hat{\Gamma}{}^{0}
  =\hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{a}\, \dagger}\, ,
\end{equation}
and thus are completely imaginary.
With the definition $\bar{\epsilon} = i \epsilon^\dagger \hat{\Gamma}{}^{0}$ 
we can derive the properties
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:spintrans}
\overline{\hat{\epsilon}}\,
\hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{a}_{1}\cdots \hat{a}_{n}}\,
\hat{\psi} =  
(-1)^{n+\left[n/2\right]}\, 
\bar{\hat{\psi}} \,
\hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{a}_{1}\cdots \hat{a}_{n}}\,
\hat{\epsilon}\, ,
\end{equation}
and so the above bilinear is symmetric for $n=0,3,4,7,8$ and antisymmetric for
$n=1,2,5,6,9,10$.

\section{$D=11$ Supergravity} \label{11Dsugra}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The bosonic part of the full $D=11$ supergravity reads in our conventions
\begin{align}
\hat{S} = & \frac{1}{16\pi G_{N}^{(11)}}{\displaystyle\int} d^{11}\hat{x}\
\sqrt{|\hat{g}|}\ \left[\hat{R}(\hat{\omega})
-{\textstyle\frac{1}{2\cdot 4!}}\hat{G}{}^{\, 2} 
-{\textstyle\frac{1}{(144)^{2}}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{|\hat{g}}|}
\hat{\epsilon}\hat{G} \hat{G} \hat{C}
\right]\, ,
\label{eq:11dtruncaction}
\end{align}

\noindent
where $\hat{G} = 4 \, \partial \hat{C}$ and $G_N^{(11)}$ is the
eleven-dimensional Newton constant.
This action is invariant under the local supersymmetry transformations
with parameter $\hat{\epsilon}$ 
\begin{align}
\delta_{\hat{\epsilon}} \hat{e}_{\hat{\mu}}{}^{\hat{a}}
= & 
-\frac{i}{2} \bar{\hat{\epsilon}}\, \hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{a}}\,
\hat{\psi}_{\hat{\mu}}\, , \notag \\
\delta_{\hat{\epsilon}} 
\hat{\psi}_{\hat{\mu}} = & 
 2\hat{\partial}_{\hat{\mu}} \hat{\epsilon}
 - \frac{1}{2} {\hat{\omega}}_{\hat{\mu}}{}^{\hat{a}\hat{b}}
\hat{\Gamma}_{\hat{a}\hat{b}} \hat{\epsilon}
+\frac{i}{144}
\left(
\hat{\Gamma}{}^{\hat{\alpha}\hat{\beta}

\hat{\eta}_{\hat{\mu}}{}^{\hat{\alpha}}
\right)
\hat{\epsilon}\,
{\hat{G}}_{\hat{\alpha}\hat{\beta}
\hat{\gamma}\hat{\delta}} \, , \notag \\
\delta_{\hat{\epsilon}} 
\hat{C}_{\hat{\mu}\hat{\nu}\hat{\rho}}
= & 
\frac{3}{2} \bar{\hat{\epsilon}}\,
\hat{\Gamma}_{[\hat{\mu}\hat{\nu}}\,
\hat{\psi}_{\hat{\rho}]}\, ,
\label{eq:11Dsusy}
\end{align}

\section{The 8-Dimensional Bosonic Action} \label{full8daction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Restricting to gauge groups with traceless 
structure constants, $f_{mn}{}^n = 0$, the full bosonic 8-dimensional action reads
\begin{align}
\label{eq:d8-Q-action}
S & = \frac{1}{16\pi G_{N}^{(11)}}\, C_U
{\displaystyle\int} d^{8}x \sqrt{|g_{E}|}\,
\left\{
R_{E} 
+\frac{1}{4}{\rm Tr}\left({\cal D} {\cal M}{\cal M}^{-1}\right)^{2}
+\frac{1}{4}{\rm Tr}\left(\partial {\cal W}{\cal W}^{-1}\right)^{2}
 \right. \notag \\
& 
\hspace{2cm}
-\frac{1}{4}F^{I\, m}{\cal M}_{mn}{\cal W}_{IJ} F^{J\, n}
+\frac{1}{2\cdot 3!} H_{m}{\cal M}^{mn} H_{n}
-\frac{1}{2\cdot 4!} e^{\varphi} G^{2} - {\cal V}\, \notag \\
& 
\hspace{2cm}
-\frac{1}{6^{3}\cdot 2^{4}}
{\textstyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g_{E}|}}}\, \epsilon
\left[GG \ell -8G H_{m} A^{2\, m} +12 G(\tilde{F}^{m}+\ell F^m)B_{m} \right. \notag \\
& 
\hspace{2cm}
\left.\left.
-8\epsilon^{mnp} H_{m}H_{n}B_{p} -8G\partial \ell C 
-16 H_{m}(\tilde{F}^{m}+\ell F^m) C \right]\right\} \, .
\end{align}
where we have made the following field strength definitions:
\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{eq:fieldstrengths2}
  G & = 4 \partial C + 6 F^{m} B_{m}\, , & \qquad
  F^{m} & = 2\partial A^{m} -\chi_{np}{}^{m}A^{n}A^{p}\, , \notag \\
  H_{m} & = 3{\cal D} B_{m} + 3 \epsilon_{mnp} F^{n} V^p\, , & 
  \tilde{F}^m & = 2{\cal D} V^m - \epsilon^{mnp} f_{np}{}^{q} B_{q}\, ,
\end{alignat}
The two vector field strengths form a doublet $F^{I\,m} = (F^m,\tilde{F}^m)$
with $I=1,2$. The $SL(2,\mathbb{R}) / SO(2)$ and $SL(3,\mathbb{R}) / SO(3)$
scalar cosets are defined in \eqref{Wscalar} and \eqref{Mscalar},
respectively. The potential ${\cal V}$ reads
\begin{equation}
 {\cal V} = {\textstyle\frac{1}{4}} e^{-\varphi}\,
             \left[ 2{\cal M}^{nq}f_{mn}{}^{p} f_{pq}{}^{m}
                  + {\cal M}^{mq}{\cal M}^{nr}{\cal M}_{ps}
                  f_{mn}{}^{p}f_{qr}{}^{s}
             \right]\, .
\label{eq:potential-1}
\end{equation}

\section{The Bianchi  Classification}\label{classifications} \label{Bianchi}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this Appendix we will discuss the Bianchi classification of 
three-dimensional Lie algebras. We will also show how different algebras are 
related via analytic continuation or group contraction. We compare our 
results with the $CSO(p,q,r)$ notation which is often used in the supergravity 
literature.

We assume that the generators of the three-dimensional Lie group
 satisfy the commutation relations ($m=1,2,3$)
\begin{align}
  [ T_m , T_n ] = f_{mn}{}^p T_p \,, 
\end{align}
with constant structure coefficients $f_{mn}{}^p$ subject to the Jacobi 
identity $ f_{m[n}{}^p f_{qr]p} = 0$. For three-dimensional Lie groups the 
structure constants have nine components and can be conveniently parameterized 
by
\begin{align}
  f_{mn}{}^p = \epsilon_{mnq} \mathsf{Q}^{pq} + 2 \delta_{[m}{}^p a_{n]} \,.
\end{align}
Here $\mathsf{Q}^{pq}$ is a symmetric matrix. The Jacobi identity implies 
$\mathsf{Q}^{pq} a_q =0$. Having $a_q=0$ corresponds to an algebra with 
traceless structure constants: $f_{mn}{}^n =0$.

Of course Lie algebras are only defined up to changes of basis $T_m 
\rightarrow R_m{}^n \, T_n$. This can always be used \cite{Wald:1984rg, 
Schirmer:1995dy} to transform $\mathsf{Q}^{pq}$ into a diagonal form and 
$a_q$ to have 
only one component. We will take $\mathsf{Q}^{pq} = \tfrac{1}{2} 
\text{diag}(q_1,q_2,q_3)$ and $a_q=(a,0,0)$. The commutation relations then 
take the form
\begin{equation}
   [T_1 , T_2] = \tfrac{1}{2} q_3 T_3 -a T_2 \,, \qquad
   [T_2 , T_3] = \tfrac{1}{2} q_1 T_1 \,, \qquad
   [T_3 , T_1] = \tfrac{1}{2} q_2 T_2 +a T_3 \,.
\end{equation}
The different three-dimensional Lie algebras have been classified and are 
given in Table \ref{3Dalgebras}. There are 11 different algebras, two of which 
are a one-parameter family. Of these only $SO(3)$ and $SO(2,1)$ are simple 
while the rest are all non-semi-simple \cite{Schirmer:1995dy,Hamermesh}. Note 
that for $a \neq 0$ the rank of $\mathsf{Q}$ can not exceed two due to the 
Jacobi identity.

\caption{\label{3Dalgebras}\it The different three-dimensional Lie algebras in

\end{center}
\end{table}

We will now show relations between all algebras of Class A, i.e. having $a=0$. 
Our starting point will be $SO(3)$. Its generators take, in our basis with 
$\mathsf{Q}=\tfrac{1}{2}\text{diag}(1,1,1)$, the form
\begin{align}
  T_1 = \tfrac{1}{2} \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
    -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right) \,, \qquad
  T_2 = \tfrac{1}{2} \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
    0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right) \,, \qquad
  T_3 = \tfrac{1}{2} \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
    0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 \end{array} \right) \,.
\end{align}
One can obtain the other algebras with $a=0$ from these $SO(3)$ generators by 
the analytic continuation and/or contraction. Define the operations $A_1$ 
(analytic continuation) and $C_1$ (contraction) by
\begin{align}
  T_2 \rightarrow \lambda^{-1} \, T_2 \,, \qquad T_3 \rightarrow \lambda^{-1} \, T_3 \,, 
\end{align}
with $\lambda = i$ for $A_1$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ for $C_1$. Its effect 
on the parameters of the algebra reads
\begin{align}
  \mathsf{Q} = \tfrac{1}{2}\text{diag} (q_1,q_2,q_3) \rightarrow 
\mathsf{Q} = \tfrac{1}{2}\text{diag} (\lambda^2 q_1,q_2,q_3) \,.
\end{align}
Thus from $SO(3)$ one can obtain $SO(2,1)$ by an $A$ operation and $ISO(2)$ 
by a $C$ operation. Similarly, the other Class A algebras are related by 
various analytic continuations and contractions, as shown in Figure 
\ref{3Drelations}.


\begin{figure}[tb]
  \centerline{\epsfig{file=reductions.eps,width=.65\textwidth}}

    structure constants. The arrows give the operations: the dashed
    arrow corresponds to the reversible analytic continuation, the
    solid arrow to the irreversible group contraction. These analytic
    continuations and contractions are defined in \eqref{C7} and
    \eqref{C8}.} \label{3Drelations}
\end{figure} 


It is instructive to compare the discussion of the previous paragraph
with the $CSO(p,q,r)$ notation which is often used in the supergravity
literature, see e.g.~\cite{Hull:1985rt, Hull:2002cv}. In our case
$p+q+r=3$ but the $CSO(p,q,r)$ classification of contracted algebras
is valid more generally. The $CSO(p,q,r)$ group is a group contraction
of $SO(p+r,q)$ and can be obtained as follows. One defines the
starting point $CSO(p,q,0) = SO(p,q)$. The effect of analytic
continuation in one of the $p$ directions is
\begin{align}\label{C7}
  A_p: \qquad CSO(p,q,r) \rightarrow CSO(p-1,q+1,r) \,,
\end{align}
while the effect of contraction is
\begin{align}\label{C8}
  C_p: \qquad CSO(p,q,r) \rightarrow CSO(p-1,q,r+1) \,.
\end{align}
This defines all Class A algebras in terms of the $CSO(p,q,r)$ classification, 
as shown in Table \ref{3Dalgebras}. These can all be obtained from the 
semi-simple algebras $SO(3)$ or $SO(2,1)$ by various contractions. Using the 
fact that $CSO(p,q,r) \sim CSO(q,p,r)$ one can see that Class A exhausts the 
possibilities of distributing $p,q,r$ subject to $p+q+r=3$.
