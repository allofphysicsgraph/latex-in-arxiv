 We derive the low energy effective action for the dilatonic braneworld.
 In the case of the single-brane model, we find 
 the effective theory is described 
 by the  Einstein-scalar theory coupled to 
 the dark radiation. Remarkably, the dark radiation is not conserved 
 in general due to a coupling to the bulk scalar field.
   The effective action incorporating  Kaluza-Klein (KK)
 corrections is  obtained and the role of the AdS/CFT correspondence 
 in the dilatonic braneworld is revealed.  
 In particular, it is shown that CFT matter would not be 
  confined to the braneworld in the presence of the bulk scalar field. 
 The relation between our analysis and the geometrical projection method is
 also clarified.  In the case of the two-brane model, 
  the effective theory reduces to a scalar-tensor
 theory with a non-trivial coupling between the radion and the bulk scalar
 field.
