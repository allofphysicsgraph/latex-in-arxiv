\begin{abstract}
 We treat the two-dimensional projection of the
 $(2+1)$ BTZ black hole (known as Achucarro-Ortiz black hole or
 as $(1+1)$ dilatonic black hole) as a Casimir-type system.
The stress tensor of a massless scalar field satisfying Dirichlet
boundary conditions on two one-dimensional ``walls'' (``Dirichlet
walls'') is explicitly calculated in three different vacua.
Without employing known regularization techniques, the expression
in each vacuum for the stress tensor is reached by using the
Wald's axioms. Finally, within this asymptotically non-flat
gravitational background, it is shown that the stability of the
configuration, obtained by setting Casimir force to zero, is
controlled by the cosmological constant.
