We discuss D-braneworld cosmology, that is, the brane is described by the 
Born-Infeld action. Compared with the usual Randall-Sundrum braneworld cosmology 
where the brane action is the Nambu-Goto one, we can see some 
drastic changes at the very early universe: (i)universe may experience the 
rapid accelerating phase 
(ii)the closed universe may avoid the initial 
singularity. We also briefly address the dynamics of the cosmology in the open 
string metric, which might be  favorer than the induced metric from the 
view point of the D-brane.
