Quaternionic formulation of $D=4$ conformal group and of its associated twistors and their relation to harmonic analyticity is presented. Generalization of $SL(2,{\cal{C}})$ to the $D=4$ conformal group $SO(5,1)$ and its covering group $SL(2,{\cal{Q}})$ that generalizes the euclidean Lorentz group in $R^4$ [namely $SO(3,1)\approx SL(2,{\cal{C}})$ which allow us to obtain the projective twistor space $CP^3$] is shown. Quasi-conformal fields are introduced in $D=4$ and Fueter mappings are shown to map self-dual sector onto itself (and similarly for the anti-self-dual part). Differentiation of Fueter series and various forms of differential operators are shown, establishing the equivalence of Fueter analyticity with twistor and harmonic analyticity. A brief discussion of possible octonion analyticity is provided.
