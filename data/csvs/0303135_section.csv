\appendix{Index $\Tr (-1)^FP$ in Non-linear Sigma Models}
\label{app:index}

Let $(X,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold of real dimension $n$.
We consider the supersymmetric non-linear sigma model
in $1+1$ dimensions whose classical
action on Minkowski space reads
w
\Scr{L}&=&{1\over 2}g_{IJ}(\partial_0\phi^I\partial_0\phi^J-
\partial_1\phi^I\partial_1\phi^J)
+{i\over 2}g_{IJ}\psi_-^I(D_0+D_1)\psi_-^J
+{i\over 2}g_{IJ}\psi_+^I(D_0-D_1)\psi_+^J
\nonumber\\
&&-{1\over 4}R_{IJKL}\psi_+^I\psi_-^J\psi_+^K\psi_-^L.
\nonumber
bbnd{eqnarray}
Supersymmetry is generated by
$\delta\phi^I=i\epsilon_+\psi_-^I+i\epsilon_-\psi_+^I$,
$\delta\psi_{\pm}^I
=-\epsilon_{\mp}(\partial_0\pm\partial_1)\phi^I$.
Let $\tau:X\to X$ be an isometric involution.
The classical action is invariant under the parity symmetry
$\tau\Omega$
w
&&\phi^I(x)\to \tau^I(\phi(\widetilde{x})),
\nonumber\\
&&\psi^I_{\pm}(x)\to \tau^I_{*J}\psi_{\mp}^J(\widetilde{x}),
\nonumber
bbnd{eqnarray}
where $\widetilde{x}=(x^0,-x^1)$ for $x=(x^0,x^1)$, and we assume that
it is anomaly-free.
We shall compute the twisted supersymmetric index $\Tr(-1)^F\tau\Omega$
for both closed and open strings.



The basic strategy is to represent the index as the partition function
on a flat surface and localize the path-integral
on the fixed point of the supersymmetry.
For example, the ordinary Witten index $\Tr(-1)^F$ on the RR sector is
path-integral on the 2-torus with periodic boundary condition in both
directions. The boundary condition is fully supersymmetric and the fixed points
are the constant maps.
In a constant background, the action consists only of the four-fermi terms.
The 1-loop integral on non-constant modes is $1$ as a consequence of
boson-fermion cancellation, and we are left with the zero mode integral,
with the $\exp$(four-fermi terms) as the weight.
This leads to integration over $X$ of
the Pfaffian of the Riemannian curvature.
The latter is the Euler class of the tangent bundle $T(X)$ of $X$,
and hence
fbegin{equation}
\Tr\!\!\mathop{}_{{\mathcal H}_{\rm RR}}\!\!(-1)^F
=\int_Xe(T(X))=\chi(X).
end{equation}
This method was introduced in \cite{AG,FWin}.


Now we compute the twisted index $\Tr(-1)^F\tau\Omega$
on the RR-sector (closed string).
It is represented as the path-integral on the Klein bottle
$(x_1,x_2)\equiv (x_1+L_1,x_2)\equiv
(-x_1,x_2+L_2)$
with the periodic boundary condition along $x_1$,
but with the twisted boundary condition along $x_2$:
w
&&\phi^I(x_1,x_2)=\tau^I(\phi(-x_1,x_2+L_2)),
\label{bcb1}\\
&&
\psi_{\pm}^I(x_1,x_2)=\tau_{*J}^I \psi_{\mp}^J(-x_1,x_2+L_2).
\label{bcf1}
bbnd{eqnarray}
This periodicity preserves the diagonal part of the
$(1,1)$ supersymmetry and one can still use the localization
method.
The fixed points of the supersymmetry are constant maps
into the set $X^{\tau}$ of $\tau$-fixed points.
We first note that the integral of modes that are not constant along
$x_1$ yields $1$ due to boson-fermion cancellation.
Thus, we can focus on modes that depend only on $x_2$.
This computation has been done beautifully in \cite{SS}.
Here is the outline.
We first separate the coordinates into tangent directions
$\phi^{\mu}$ to $X^{\tau}$ and normal directions $\phi^i$.
Let $n_1$ be the real dimension of $X^{\tau}$, so that
$\mu=1,...,n_1$ and $i=1,...,n-n_1$.
By (\ref{bcb1}), $\phi^{\mu}$ is periodic and $\phi^i$ is antiperiodic
along $x_2$.
By (\ref{bcf1}), the periodicity of the fermions are
w
\psi_+^{\mu}+\psi_-^{\mu}:&&\mbox{periodic}
\nonumber\\
\psi_+^{\mu}-\psi_-^{\mu}:&&\mbox{anti-periodic}
\nonumber\\
\psi_+^{i}+\psi_-^{i}:&&\mbox{anti-periodic}
\nonumber\\
\psi_+^{i}-\psi_-^{i}:&&\mbox{periodic}
\nonumber
bbnd{eqnarray}
We also note that $R_{IJKL}\psi_+^I\psi_-^J\psi_+^K\psi_-^L$
is proportional to $R_{IJKL}(\psi_++\psi_-)^I(\psi_++\psi_-)^J
(\psi_+-\psi_-)^K(\psi_+-\psi_-)^L$.
It follows that the zero mode action is the curvature of the normal bundle
to $X^{\tau}$.
The one-loop integral of the non-zero modes yields
w
\phi^{\mu}:&&
{\det}^{-{1\over 2}}_P(\partial^2+iR_{T}\partial)
=(2\pi \beta)^{-{n_1\over 2}}
\prod_{\lambda_{T}} {\lambda_{T}\beta/2\over
\sinh(\lambda_{T}\beta/2)}
\nonumber\\
\psi_+^{\mu}+\psi_-^{\mu}:&&
{\rm Pf}_P(i\partial)=1
\nonumber\\
\psi_+^{\mu}-\psi_-^{\mu}:&&
{\rm Pf}_A(i\partial+R_{T})=\prod_{\lambda_{T}}
2\cosh(\lambda_{T}\beta/2)
\nonumber\\
\phi^i:&&
{\det}_A^{-{1\over 2}}(\partial^2+iR_{N}\partial)
=\prod_{\lambda_{N}}{1\over 4\cosh(\lambda_{N}\beta/2)}
\nonumber\\
\psi_+^i+\psi_-^i:&&
{\rm Pf}_A(i\partial)=\prod_{\lambda_{N}}2
\nonumber\\
\psi_+^i-\psi_-^i:&&
{\rm Pf}_P(i\partial +R_{N})
=\prod_{\lambda_{N}}
{\sinh(\lambda_{N}\beta/2)\over \lambda_{N}\beta/2}
\nonumber
bbnd{eqnarray}
Here $\partial$ is the derivative with respect to $x_2$.
 $R_{T}$ is the curvature of the tangent bundle of $X^{\tau}$
and $(i\lambda_{T},-i\lambda_{T})$
are its eigenvalues, and similarly for the curvature of the normal bundle
$R_{N}$. (Here we assume that both $n$ and $n_1$ are even,
for simplicity.)
$\beta$ is the circumference $L_2$ in the $x_2$ direction,
on which the final expression should not depend.
In this notation, the zero mode action contributes by a factor
$$
\prod_{\lambda_{N}}\lambda_{N}\beta.
$$
Collecting all together, the zero mode integral is
 $$
\int_{X^{\tau}}(\pi\beta)^{-{n_1\over 2}}\prod_{\lambda_{T}}
{\lambda_{T}\beta/2\over\tanh(\lambda_{T}\beta/2)}
\prod_{\lambda_{N}}{\tanh(\lambda_{N}\beta/2)\over
\lambda_{N}\beta/2}
\prod_{\lambda_{N}}\lambda_{N}\beta/2.
$$
This indeed does not depend on $\beta$ because $n_1=\dim X^{\tau}$
and $\lambda_{T}$, $\lambda_{N}$ are 2-forms.
Setting $\beta=1/\pi$,
we find the following index formula
fbegin{equation}
\Tr\!\!\mathop{}_{{\mathcal H}_{\rm RR}}\!\!(-1)^F\tau\Omega
=\int_{X^{\tau}}{L(T(X^{\tau}))\over
L(N(X^{\tau}))}e(N(X^{\tau})),
end{equation}
 $L(V)$ is the Hirzebruch L-genus
defined by $\prod_{\lambda_V}(\lambda_V/2\pi)/\tanh(\lambda_V/2\pi)$.





We next consider the twisted index for an open string.
The string has one end on a D-brane wrapped on
$W\subset X$ and supporting a complex vector bundle $E$,
and the other end on the image brane $(\tau W,\tau E)$.
The boundary condition preserves the same supersymmetry as
$\tau\Omega$ preserves, and one can consider twisted Witten index
$\Tr (-1)^F\tau\Omega$.
This is represented as the path-integral on the M\""obius strip
$(x_1,x_2)=(L_1-x_1,x_2+L_2)$, $0\leq x_1\leq L_1$,
with the boundary condition at one end
w
&&\partial_2\phi^I(0,x_2),\,
(\psi_+^I+\psi_-^I)(0,x_2):\quad \mbox{tangent to $W$},
\label{bc21}
\\
&&\partial_1\phi^I(0,x_2),\,
(\psi_+^I-\psi_-^I)(0,x_2):\quad
\mbox{normal to $W$},
\label{bc22}
bbnd{eqnarray}
and similar condition at the other end $(L_1,x_2)$.
The coupling to the gauge field $A$ for the bundle
$E$ is through the Chan-Paton factor
fbegin{equation}
{\rm tr}_{\overline{E}}P\exp\left\{
-i\int_{x_1=0}
\Bigl(\,-{}^t\!A_M\partial_2\phi^M
-i\,{}^t\!F_{MN}(\psi_++\psi_-)^M(\psi_++\psi_-)^N\Bigr)
w\rm d} x_2\right\}"
