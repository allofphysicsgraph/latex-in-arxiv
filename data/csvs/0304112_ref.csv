3,"\ref {eq:detzero}). We have, 
using our renormalization scheme,  \begin{equation}
V[\rho] = -\frac {\alpha_0} {\beta^2} \cos \beta \sqrt{\rho} \rightarrow V_r[\rho_r]
\end{equation}
where now
\begin{equation}
V_r[\rho_r] =-\frac {m^2} {\beta^2} \cos \beta \sqrt{\rho_r}
\end{equation}
and
$\rho_r = \phi^2 + G_r$ with the subtraction being made at the physical mass $m$.
Taking two derivatives we find that
\begin{equation}
V''[\rho] = m^2 \frac{\beta^2}{4 x^2} \left[ \cos x - \frac{\sin x}{x}     \right]
\end{equation}
where $x= \beta \sqrt \rho_r$ , $\rho_r = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \ln \frac{m^2}{\chi}$
At the stationary phase pont we need the limit of $V''$ as $x \rightarrow 0$ 
This is
\begin{equation}
V''[\rho] \rightarrow  -m^2 \frac{\beta^2}{12}
\end{equation}
The condition for the determinant of the fluctuations to be positive is 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma(0) V^{\prime \prime} [\rho] + \frac{1}{2}  >0, \label{eq:pos}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Sigma(q=0,\chi) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \chi}.
\end{equation}
Eq. \ref{eq:pos} leads to the condition (when $\chi \rightarrow m^2$) 
\begin{equation}
\beta^2  \leq 24 \pi.
\end{equation}
This is the same result as that we found for the stability of the vacuum 

To go beyond the lowest order approximation one first includes the Gaussian
fluctuations and
considers $\rho$ and  $\chi$ as components of a new two component field with
matrix inverse propagator $D^{-1}$.
The one particle irreducible generating functional now gets a contribution
\begin{equation}
\frac{i}{2 N} Tr Ln[D^{-1}]
\end{equation}
However this naive $1/N$ expansion is secular for time evolution problems as
shown in \cite{ref:Bogdan}.  A better approximation which avoids secularity
is a resummed next to leading order
in 1/N expansion obtained from the two-particle
irreducible formalism \cite{ref:CJT} written in terms of the fields
$\phi,\chi,\rho$ and propagators ${\cal G}$ and $D$. The  self-consistent
$1/N$ correction is found from the Graph in $\Gamma_2[\Phi, {\cal G}]$
\begin{equation} \Gamma_2= \frac{i}{4} Tr \int dx dy  {\cal G}(x,y) D(x,y)
{\cal G}(y,x) \end{equation} which will give the same Schwinger Dyson
equations
as the standard 1-PI 1/N  expansion except with FULL propagators and not
leading order ones in the self energy graphs.  This is discussed in detail
in \cite{ref:dawson} \cite{ref:berges}.
\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we have shown how to generalize the Sine-Gordon equation to the case of
O(N) symmetry.  This then allows  us to go beyond the Gaussian
approximation (at large-N) in a systematic, controlable way.  We found that at
leading order in large N, the pole in the propagator looks functionally
different from that found in the Hartree approximation for $N=1$. Thus the
combinatorics of large-N for non-polynomial potentials leads to expressions for
the evolution of the one and two point function which look qualitatively
different from what is found for polynomial potentials. We also found that the
stability of the mean-field vacuum found using a Hamiltonian approach leads to
the same condition as the stability of the large-N approximation found by
studying Gaussian fluctuations about the leading order. We briefly
discussed the fact that the naive $1/N$ expansion is secular beyond leading
order and has to be replaced by a resummed $1/N$ expansion obtainable from a
two particle irreducibility approach.
