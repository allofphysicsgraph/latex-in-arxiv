\section*{Appendix}
\section*{Improved energy-momentum tensor and global conservation
law}

\setcounter{equation}{0}

In this appendix we examine the conservation of energy-momentum in the
theory with the ""improved"" energy-momentum tensor (\ref{iemt}).
The general situation in noncommutative field theories is as follows.
In deriving conserved quantities with the help of Noether's theorem,
the cyclicity property of the star product (\ref{cp}), which is proved
by integration by parts, is used.
Therefore, in the equation which arise in Noether's theorem
\begin{equation}
\label{A1}
\epsilon^k\int\partial_\mu J^\mu_k\,d^4x=0,
\end{equation}
with $\epsilon^k=const$ being arbitrary global parameters of the
symmetry transformation and $J^\mu_k$ being currents, the integration
region in noncommutative theories is the whole space-time, unlike
commutative theories where the integration region is still arbitrary,
because integration by parts is not used.
As a result, in contrast with the commutative case, we do not have
local conservation laws in noncommutative theory.
However, the quantity $\partial_\mu{}J^\mu$ must vanish at
$\theta\to0$, since there exists a smooth
commutative limit at the classical level.
Therefore, the most we may have is
(see e.g. \cite{0008057})
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\partial_\mu J^\mu
=
\Bigl\{f,g\Bigr\},
\\&&\qquad
\Bigl\{f,g\Bigr\}\equiv{}f\star{}g-g\star{}f,
\end{eqnarray}
with $f$ and $g$ being some functions of the fields. In this case, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{div}
\int\partial_\mu{}J^\mu\,d^{3}x
&=&
\int\Bigl\{f,g\Bigr\}d^{3}x.
\end{eqnarray}
The r.h.s. of (\ref{div}) vanishes only in the case
$\theta^{0i}=0$, and then the charge $Q=\int{}J^0\,d^{3}x$ is
conserved. Thus, in noncommutative field theories
there are only global conservation laws\footnote{An attempt to
construct the locally conserved energy-momentum tensor in
noncommutative scalar field theory was made in the work
\cite{0104244}.} and only when $\theta^{0i}=0$.

This situation may also be explained as follows.
In calculating (\ref{A1}) in the case of only spatial
noncommutativity $\theta^{0i}=0$, integrating by parts is
carried out only in spatial directions and not in the
time coordinate.
So, the time integration region is still arbitrary, in this case,
and we can write
\begin{eqnarray}
\int\partial_\mu{}J^{\mu}d^3x
&=&
\partial_0\int{}J^0d^3x=0.
\end{eqnarray}
Thus, we have the conserved quantity $Q=\int{}J^0d^3x$.

Let us turn to noncommutative scalar field theory. If we choose the
energy-momentum tensor as in (\ref{bemt}), it satisfies the relation
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu}
=
\frac{\lambda}{4!}
\Bigl\{\bigl\{\phi,\partial_\nu\phi\bigr\},\phi\star{}\phi\Bigr\}.
\end{eqnarray}
This means that a global conservation law exists.
However, such choice of $T_{\mu\nu}$ is not finite.
If we improve the energy-momentum tensor and make
it finite (\ref{iemt}), then
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{diviemt}
\partial^\mu T_{\mu\nu}^I
&=&
\frac{\lambda}{4!}
\Bigl\{\bigl\{\phi,\partial_\nu\phi\bigr\},\phi\star{}\phi\Bigr\}
-
\frac{1}{4}\, m^2 \partial_\nu (\phi\star\phi).
\end{eqnarray}
From (\ref{diviemt}) we see that, after integrating over the
whole space, the last term in (\ref{diviemt}) disappears if $\nu$
is a spatial index and the field $\phi$ has the proper
asymptotic behaviour. So, the momentum is always conserved, but
the energy is conserved only for a vanishing mass. Hence, in the
theory under consideration we may construct an energy-momentum
tensor which is finite and leads to conserved energy and
momentum only in a massless theory.


However, there exists another way to define global
conservation laws.
Let us introduce the quantity
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\nu}=\int{}T^0_{\nu}d^{3}x
\label{cemv}
\end{eqnarray}
with $T^\mu_{\nu}$ being the canonical energy-momentum tensor
(\ref{bemt}).
It is evident that $P_\nu$ in (\ref{cemv}) is conserved in time
$\partial^0P_{\nu}=0$ for the spatial noncommutativity.
Next, we show that in this case the quantity (\ref{cemv}) is a finite
operator, at least in the one-loop approximation.

The operator $T_{\mu\nu}$ (\ref{bemt}) is a linear combination
of five composite operators.
As a result, the operator $P_{\nu}$ in (\ref{cemv}) is a linear
combination of these composite operators at zero momentum
transfer.
We study the renormalization of the operator $P_{\nu}$ in (\ref{cemv}).
Let us begin with the operator
\begin{math}
\frac{m^2_0}{2}\int\phi_0\star\phi_0\,d^{d-1}x.
\end{math}
In order to renormalize such an operator, we put $J_1(x)=\delta(x^0-t)$ in
the integrand of (\ref{1op}).
Then, this corresponds to $J_1\sim\delta(\vec{k})$ in the expression
(\ref{f1b}), which leads to $p_\mu\theta^{\mu\nu}k_\nu=0$ in
(\ref{mf2}), and we find that the number of planar diagrams is
twice more than in the case of the renormalization of the
operator at arbitrary momentum transfer and so the counterterm
is also two times larger than (\ref{f2ct}).
Thus, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{m_0^2}{2}\int\phi_0\star\phi_0\,d^{d-1}x
&=&
\frac{m^2}{2}\left[\int\phi\star{}\phi\,d^{d-1}x\right].
\label{f^2}
\end{eqnarray}

Analogous considerations may be carried out for the other
operators and we get
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
\frac{\lambda_0}{4!}
\int\phi_0\star\phi_0\star\phi_0\star\phi_0\,d^{d-1}x
&=&
\left(1+\frac{1}{d-4}\frac{2/3\lambda}{(4\pi)^2}\right)
  \frac{\mu^{4-d}\lambda}{4!}
\left[
  \int\phi\star\phi\star\phi\star\phi\,d^{d-1}x\right]
\\
&&{}
+
\frac{1}{d-4}\frac{2/3\lambda}{(4\pi)^2}
\frac{m^2}{2}\left[\int\phi\star\phi\,d^{d-1}x\right],
\label{f^4}
\\
\nonumber
\int\partial_\mu\phi_0\star\partial_\nu\phi_0\,d^{d-1}x
&=&
\left[\int\partial_\mu\phi\star\partial_\nu\phi\,d^{d-1}x\right]
\\&&{}
%\nonumber
\label{pf^2}
\hspace*{-20mm}
+
\frac{\mu^{4-d}}{d-4}
\frac{\lambda^2}{(3!)^2\,(4\pi)^2}\,
\eta_{\mu\nu}
\left[\int\phi\star{}\phi\star{}\phi\star{}\phi\,d^{d-1}x\right]
+
\\&&{}
\nonumber
\hspace*{-20mm}
+
\frac{1}{d-4}\frac{\lambda/3}{(4\pi)^2}
\Bigl(
\frac{1}{6}\eta_{\mu\nu}\partial^2_{00}
+
\frac{1}{3}\delta^0_\mu\delta^0_\nu\partial^2_{00}
+
m^2\eta_{\mu\nu}
\Bigr)
\left[\int\phi\star\phi\,d^{d-1}x\right].
\end{eqnarray}
It should be noted here that in the case of spatial
noncommutativity $\theta^{0i}=0$ we have got the same
renormalization constants as in the case of the
renormalization of
the operators at zero momentum transfer (\ref{mff}, \ref{ffff},
\ref{fppf}).
This happened, owing to the fact that such a noncommutativity does not
affect the time components of variables, and thus there exists a
smooth limit $p_0\to0$ ($p_0$ being the time component of the
transferred momentum) at the quantum level.
So, it makes no difference, whether the operator is integrated over
time or not.

Let us turn now to the energy-momentum vector $P_\nu$ in (\ref{cemv}).
Substituting eqs. (\ref{f^2}, \ref{f^4}, \ref{pf^2}) into the r.h.s.
of (\ref{cemv}) one gets
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{\nu}
&=&
\frac{1}{2}
\left[\int\partial_0\phi\star\partial_\nu\phi\,d^{3}x\right]
+
\frac{1}{2}
\left[\int\partial_\nu\phi\star\partial_0\phi\,d^{3}x\right]
-
\frac{1}{2}\,\eta_{0\nu}
\left[\int\partial_\alpha\phi\star\partial^\alpha\phi\,d^{3}x\right]
\nonumber
\\
&&{}
+
\eta_{0\nu}\,
\frac{m^2}{2}\left[\int\phi\star{}\phi\,d^{3}x\right]
+
\eta_{0\nu}\,
\frac{\lambda}{4!}
\left[
  \int\phi\star\phi\star\phi\star\phi\,d^{3}x\right].
\label{remv}
\end{eqnarray}
We see that (\ref{remv}) is expressed in terms of renormalized
composite operators and hence is also finite.
Thus, the quantity $P_{\nu}$ in (\ref{cemv}) may be considered as
the energy-momentum vector of the field $\phi$ in the
noncommutative theory.
