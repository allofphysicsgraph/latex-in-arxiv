A regular bouncing universe is obtained in the context of a
dilaton-gravity brane world scenario. The scale factor starts in a
contracting inflationary phase both in the Einstein and in the string
frame, it then undergoes a bounce (due to interaction with the bulk
Weyl tensor), and subsequently enters into a decelerated expanding
era. This {\it graceful exit} is obtained at low curvature and low
coupling, and without violating the Null Energy Condition.
