Some methods of the ``unfolded dynamics'' machinery particularly useful
for the analysis of higher spin gauge theories are summarized.
A formulation
of $4d$ conformal  higher spin theories in $Sp(8)$ invariant space-time
with matrix coordinates  and its extension to $Sp(2M)$ invariant
space-times are discussed.  A new result on the global characterizaton
of  causality of physical events in the $Sp(2M)$ invariant space-time
is announced.
%This paper is an extended version of the  talk given at the 3rd Sakharov
%  Conference on Physics, Moscow 2002.
