Starting with a Lie algebroid ${\cal A}$ over a space $M$ we  lift
its action to the canonical transformations on the affine bundle
${\cal R}$ over the cotangent bundle $T^*M$. Such lifts are classified
by the first cohomology $H^1({\cal A})$. The resulting object is a
Hamiltonian algebroid ${\cal A}^H$ over ${\cal R}$ with the anchor map from
$\Gamma({\cal A}^H)$ to Hamiltonians of canonical transformations.
Hamiltonian algebroids generalize Lie algebras of
canonical transformations. We prove that the BRST operator for ${\cal A}^H$
is cubic in the ghost fields as in the Lie algebra case.
The Poisson sigma model is a natural example of this construction.
Canonical transformations of its phase space define a Hamiltonian algebroid
with the Lie brackets related to the Poisson structure on the target space.
We apply this scheme to analyze the symmetries of generalized deformations
of complex structures on Riemann curves $\Sigma_{g,n}$ of genus $g$
with $n$ marked points.
We endow the space of local ${\rm GL}(N,{\mC})$-opers with the Adler-Gelfand-Dikii (AGD)
Poisson brackets. Its allows us to define a Hamiltonian algebroid over
the phase space of $W_N$-gravity on $\Sigma_{g,n}$. The sections of the
algebroid are Volterra operators on $\Sigma_{g,n}$   with the Lie brackets
coming from the AGD bivector. The symplectic reduction
defines the finite-dimensional moduli space of $W_N$-gravity and in particular
the moduli space of the complex structures $\bar{\partial}$ on $\Sigma_{g,n}$ deformed
by the Volterra operators.
