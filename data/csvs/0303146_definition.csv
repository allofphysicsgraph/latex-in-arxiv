Let $(M,g)$ be a four dimensional Riemannian spin manifold and
$\nabla^\pm$ be a smooth self-dual $SU(2)$ connection of finite action on
the chiral spinor bundle $S^\pm M$. If there is a smooth function
$f: M\rightarrow\R$ such that the projected Levi--Civit\'a
connection of $f^2g$ is gauge equivalent to $\nabla^\pm$ then this
connection is called an {\em 't Hooft instanton} over $(M,g)$.
