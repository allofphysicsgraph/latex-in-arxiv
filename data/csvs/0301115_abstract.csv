field theory is applied to a simple model. Within this model
states are identified which are locally (but not globally)
in thermal equilibrium and it is shown that their local thermal 
properties evolve according to macroscopic 
equations. The largest space--time regions 
in which local equilibrium states can exist are 
timelike cones. Thus, although the model does 
not describe dissipative effects, such states fix in
a natural manner a time direction. Moreover, generically 
they determine a distinguished space--time point where 
a singularity in the temperature (a hot bang) must have 
occurred if local equilibrium prevailed thereafter. The

symmetry at macroscopic scales manifests itself in a 
microscopic setting.}
