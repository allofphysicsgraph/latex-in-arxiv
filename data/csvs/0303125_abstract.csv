Brane-induced gravity in five dimensions (Dvali--Gabadadze--Porrati
model) exhibits modification of gravity at ultra-large distances,
$r\gg r_c = M_{Pl}^2/M^3$  where
$M$ is the five-dimensional gravity scale.
This makes the model 
potentially interesting for explaining the observed
acceleration of the Universe. We argue, however,
that it has an intrinsic intermediate
energy scale $(M^9/M_{Pl}^4)^{1/5}$.
At higher energies,
the model is strongly coupled. For $r_c$ of order of the present
Hubble size, the strong coupling regime occurs at distanced below
tens of metres.
