Sen has recently drawn attention to an exact  time-dependent
Boundary Conformal Field Theory with the space-time interpretation
of  brane creation and annihilation. An interesting limit of this
BCFT  is formally equivalent to an array of D-branes located in
{\it imaginary} time.
 This raises the question: what is the
meaning of D-branes in imaginary time? The answer we propose is
that D-branes in imaginary time define {\it purely closed} string
backgrounds.
 In particular we prove that the
disk scattering amplitude of $m$ closed strings off  an arbitrary
configuration of imaginary branes is {\it equivalent} to a {\it
sphere}  amplitude with $m+1$ closed string insertions. The extra
puncture is a specific closed string state, generically
normalizable, that depends on the details of the brane
configuration. We study in some detail the special case of the
array of imaginary D-branes related to Sen's BCFT and comment on
its space-time interpretation. We point out that a  certain limit
of our set-up allows to study classical black hole creation and
suggests a relation between  Choptuik's critical behavior and a
phase-transition  {\it \` a la} Gregory-Laflamme. We speculate that
open string field theory on imaginary D-branes is dual to string
theory on the corresponding closed string background.
