We present a novel derivation of the duality between the two-dimensional 
Euclidean black hole and supersymmetric Liouville theory. We 
realise these $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field 
theories on the worldvolume of domain walls in a $(2+1)$-dimensional 
gauge theory. We show that there exist two complementary descriptions 
of the domain wall dynamics, resulting in the two mirror conformal field theories. 
In particular, 
effects which are usually attributed to worldsheet instantons are captured by the 
classical scattering of domain walls.
