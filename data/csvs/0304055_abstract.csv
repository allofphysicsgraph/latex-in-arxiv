%{{\ccc Abstract.}
We study the quantization problem of relativistic scalar and
spinning particles interacting with a radiation electromagnetic
field by using the path integral and the external source method.
The spin degrees of freedom are described in terms of Grassmann
variables and the Feynman kernel is obtained through functional
integration on both Bose and Fermi variables. We provide 
rigourous proof that the Feynman amplitudes are only determined by
the classical contribution and we explicitly evaluate the
propagators.
