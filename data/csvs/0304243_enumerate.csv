\item {\it Lattice translation}: Although this is not a symmetry of
the gauge group, it is the redundancy of the formulation by the
  shift vector.
Under the translation
$$ V \mapsto V + \alpha, $$
by a root vector $\alpha$, the condition (\ref{master})
does not change, since the root vector is also an element of the dual lattice
(self dual),
any vector of which has only integer value when taking the dot product
with any root vector.

\item {\it Weyl reflection}: The Weyl
reflection($\sigma_\alpha$)
is defined as a reflection about the plane whose
normal vector is the root($\alpha$) of the group.
$$
V \mapsto \sigma_\alpha V = \sigma_{-\alpha} V
= V - 2\frac{\alpha\cdot V}{\alpha^2}\alpha
=V-(\alpha \cdot V)\alpha.
$$
We know that the set of any number of successive reflections form
a group. The group generated by the Weyl reflections is called
Weyl group.

\item {\it Outer automorphism}: The Dynkin diagram, which is a
diagrammatical representation of the Cartan matrix, contains
almost every information of the given group. Every small circle(or
bullet) represents a simple root and the linking lines
rerepresents the angle between the simple roots linked.[In our
case, we consider only small circles and singly connected lines.]
Some Dynkin diagram possesses some exchange symmetry, which is the
outer automorphism of the group. Some of the previous works
classifying orbifold models neglected this possibility. In fact,
many breaking patterns turn out to be the identical one.

Take $a=\frac13 \gamma_4$, or
$w=[00010000|w_{0} w_0^{SU_3} w_0^{E_6}]$.
Since $\sum n_i w_i = 5 \ne 0$ mod 3, $\alpha^0$ fails to pass the projection.
$w_0$ is determined to be 1 with $w_2 = -2$ from Eq.(\ref{w0}).
Having
$n_0^{SU_3}=1$ and $n_4^{E_6} = 2$,
the other coefficients are determined to be
$w_0^{SU_3} = 2$ and $w_0^{E_6} = 1$
from Eq.(\ref{lessn_sub_n}) and (\ref{lessn_sub_s}).
The resulting group is
$SU(2)\times SU(2)\times SU(5)$ and the final
$w$ leading to this group is $w=[00010000|121]$.
We leave $w_2$ to be zero for simplicity in this paper since it gives
no information about the group structure.

\item
Consider $a=\frac 13 \gamma_8 $. In this case $\alpha^0$ survives
since $\sum n_iw_i=3$. Thus no simple root in $SU(3)$ group fail to
pass the projection. We can take either $w_0 =0$ or $w_0 =3$, the
result is the same, being $w_0^{SU_3}=3$ or $w_0^{SU_3}=0$, respectively.
For $E_6$ part, $n_8^{E_6}=2$, thus we have $w_0^{E_6}=1$.
As a result, we have $w=[00000001|031]$ and the resulting group
is $SU(3)\times SU(6)$.

\item
A more interesting case is $a=\frac13 \gamma_5$, or $w=[00001000|030]$.
Both $\alpha^0$ and $\alpha^{E_6}$ survive.
Therefore, a fairly large group of $SU(3)^4$ survives.
By looking at the Dynkin diagram, one notes
a symmetry by permutating three of $SU(3)$'s.
This has been used for an $SU(3)^3$ unification
model\cite{kim}.

\item Determine the number of compact dimensions and the
orbifold which determines the order
$N$ of the shift.
\item Find all possible shift vector $v$  having the coefficient $s_i$
which satisfies Eq.(\ref{Kacond}) for given order $N$, for single
gauge group $E_8$.
\item The allowed shift vector $V$ for $E_8 \times E_8$ can be selected from
the combination of two shift vectors for single $E_8$ by requiring the
modular invariance condition (\ref{modinv}).
\item The surviving gauge group for the chosen shift vector can be read off
from the extended Dynkin diagram using the method explained in this paper.
\item Whenever we add Wilson line $a_i$, repeat the process from step 2,
  using Eq.(\ref{Kacond_sub}) this time.
