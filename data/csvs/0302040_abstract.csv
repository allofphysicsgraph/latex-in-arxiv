We note that the existence of physical states which are
coherent superpositions of
states with even and odd numbers of fermions means the
existence, together with $x,y,z,t$, of additional spinor
dimensions of space-time. A system with variable number of electrons is
described in which such superpositions are realized. Experiments with
mesoscopic condensed matter systems are suggested which generalize the
experiment of Nakamura et al. and may provide direct observation of
such superpositions and, thereby, justify the reality of a superspace with
additional spinor dimensions introduced in quantum field theory to account for
supersymmetry. The nature of additional dimensions of space-time is elucidated
for nonrelativistic systems.
