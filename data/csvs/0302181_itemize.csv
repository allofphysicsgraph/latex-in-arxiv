\item {\em Low energy effective string action}

The lowest order $\bar{D}$-dimensional string effective action 
coming from the beta function of the string world-sheet is characterized by 
\cite{Lidsey:1999mc} 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\bar{D}}=\int d^{\bar{D}} x \sqrt{-g_{\bar{D}}} \,
\frac{e^{-\psi}}{2} \left[ R_{\bar{D}}+(\nabla \psi)^2-\frac{1}{12} H_{\mu 
\nu \lambda} H^{\mu \nu \lambda} \right]\,,
\label{lowest}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\psi$ is the dilaton, $H_{\mu \nu \lambda}$ is the antisymmetric
tensor field.  Let us compactify the $k=\bar{D}-4$ dimensions by 
introducing a modulus field, $e^{k\bar{\chi}}$.  We define an effective 
dilaton in four dimensions as $\vp=\psi-k \bar{\chi}$. We also introduce a
pseudo-scalar axion field $\sigma$ as 
$H^{\mu\nu\lambda}=e^{\vp}\epsilon^{\mu\nu\lambda \rho} \nabla_{\rho} 
\sigma$ by taking into account the fact that $H^{\mu\nu\lambda}$ has only one 
degree of freedom in 4 dimensions \cite{Lidsey:1999mc}.  
Then we get the action (\ref{Baction}) 
with $D=4$, $\omega=-1$, $\chi=\sqrt{k}\bar{\chi}$, $n=-1$, ${\cal L}_m=0$ 
and ${\cal L}_c=0$.
 
\item {\em String/Brane-gas cosmology}

The string-gas cosmology \cite{Bassett:2003ck} is an attempt to explain why 
and how the three spatial dimensions become large and other 6 or 7 are kept 
to be small.  The bulk action in 10 or 11 dimensions is assumed to take the 
same form as (\ref{lowest}), but we have additional source matters due to 
the presence of the ideal string-gas in thermal equilibrium.  The simplest 
version of the string-gas cosmology \cite{Bassett:2003ck} corresponds to 
$\omega=-1$, $\chi=0$, $\sigma=0$, ${\cal L}_m \ne 0$ and ${\cal L}_c=0$ in 
(\ref{Baction}).  Instead of introducing a modulus field, one considers the 
evolution of one scale factor for $(D-1)$ spatial dimensions or two scale 
factors for large and small dimensions \cite{Bassett:2003ck}.  
In this work we shall also analyze 
the case where the axion is present ($\sigma \ne 0$).  Note that the 
brane-gas cosmology discussed in refs.~\cite{Alex,Brand} belongs to this 
class with a different matter source when we use the low energy bulk action 
(\ref{lowest}) with $\omega=-1$.

\item {\em Cosmology with $p$-brane or D$p$-brane solitons}

The $p$-brane or D$p$-brane are the solitonic degrees of freedom on which
string endpoints live.  These can be fundamentally important when the string 
coupling is large, since they are light in the high curvature regime 
\cite{Maggiore:1998cz,Riotto:1999kn}.  In the string $\sigma$-model whose 
metric is minimally coupled to the $p$-brane, Duff {\em et al.} 
\cite{Duff:1994an} showed that the effective action can be described by 
(\ref{Baction}) with $\chi=0$, $\sigma=0$, ${\cal L}_m \ne 0$ and 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\omega=-\frac{(D-1)(\bar{p}-2)-\bar{p}^2}{(D-2)(\bar{p}-2)-\bar{p}^2}\,,
\label{omebrane}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\bar{p}=p+1$.  
{}From this we have $\omega=-1$ for the string ($p=1$).
However $\omega$ depends upon the values of $d$ and $p$
for the $p$-branes with $p \ne 1$. 
Cosmology in this scenario was investigated 
in refs.~\cite{Park:1997dw,Park:1999xn} in the absence of higher-order 
corrections to the tree-level action (see also ref.~\cite{Rama}).

\item {\em F-theory}

The superstring type IIB theory can be reformulated geometrically 
within the framework of 12 dimensional theory-- 
called $F$-theory \cite{Vafa:1996xn,Khviengia:1997rh}.  
After the dimensional reduction from 12 to 10 dimensions, the following 
action may be obtained \cite{Fabris:2002pm}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S=\frac12 \int d^{10} x \sqrt{-g_{10}}\left[ e^{-\vp}\left( R_{10}
+3(\nabla \vp)^2-\frac{1} {12} F_{\mu \nu \lambda} F^{\mu \nu \lambda} 
\right)-\frac{1}{8} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} \right]\,,
\label{F}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the terms $F_{\mu\nu}$ and $F_{\mu\nu\lambda}$ come
from the Ramond-Ramond (RR) sector of the type IIB 
superstring.  This action is different from the standard string theory with 
$\omega=-1$.  Making the similar dimensional reduction from 10 to 4 
dimensions as (\ref{lowest}) with the isotropization of the RR terms, we 
get the action (\ref{Baction}) with $\omega =-3$, $\chi \ne 0$, $\sigma \ne 
0$ ($n=-1$) and the radiation fluid term (${\cal L}_m \ne 0$) coming from 
the 5-form of the RR sector.  The axionic terms minimally coupled to the 
dilaton can also appear from the same RR sector \cite{Fabris:2002pm}.  This 
corresponds to the case of adding another field with $n=0$ in the action 
(\ref{Baction}).

\item {\em Multidimensional cosmologies}

The low energy limit of the string effective action may be reformulated in the 
context of multidimensional theories \cite{Freund:1982pg}.  In its simplest 
form the multidimensional theories contain only the geometry, in which case 
one has $\omega=(1-\tilde{d})/\tilde{d}$ with $\chi=\sigma=0$ by the 
dimensional reduction ($\tilde{d}$ is the number of compactified 
dimensions).  When a 2-form field or a conformal gauge field with 
$(\tilde{d}+4)/2$-form is present, we have an axionic term $\sigma$ in 
eq.~(\ref{Baction}) with $n=-2/\tilde{d}+1$ or $n=-2/\tilde{d}$, 
respectively.  Therefore we keep the value of $n$ arbitrary so that 
multidimensional theories are also included in (\ref{Baction}).

\item 
Even for the general $(d+1)$-dimensional action with modulus and axion 
fields, the system is integrable for the flat FRW background if the matter 
source is radiation ($\rho=dp$) or there is no matter ($\rho=p=0$).

\item 
In the case of $\omega=-1$, we find nonsingular bouncing solutions 
where the universe starts out from the state of 
the finite scalar curvature and 
asymptotically approaches the radiation dominant stage with decreasing 
curvature and finite string coupling.  This situation naturally appears in 
the context of string-gas cosmology.

\item 
In the theories where $\omega$ is largely negative,
we have a sequence of regular bouncing solutions where the string coupling 
and the scalar curvature remain finite.  
This was already pointed out in 
ref.~\cite{Fabris:2002jt,Fabris:2002pm} for $d=3$, but we extended the 
analysis to the case of the general spatial dimension $d$ with modulus 
fields.

\item 
As a ``stringy'' matter source, we considered the ideal string-gas in thermal 
equilibrium taking into account the massive state coming from Kaluza-Klein 
and winding modes in addition to the leading massless state.
Numerically we obtained nonsingular bouncing solutions where the ``large'' 
3 dimensions asymptotically approach the almost radiation dominant universe
irrespective of the presence of the axion. 
This indicates that inclusion of the radiation-like source is crucial for the 
existence of such regular solutions.
