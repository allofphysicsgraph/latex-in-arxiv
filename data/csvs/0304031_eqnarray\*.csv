\section{Cosmos Theory}

Quantum theory treats of sharp filtration processes.
No experimenter can carry out sharp filtration
processes on the entire cosmos.
How can one make a sensible cosmos theory?

Actually field theorists do this all the time.
Laplace already did it.
Their method was to ignore the
philosophical problem and invent
an imaginary exocosmic observer.
We do the same.

The Segal criterion helps here:
The purely operationalist theory
is naive, and makes the
absolute experimenter into a destabilizing
idol.

Thus the first step is to renounce operationalism.
Instead of the usual idealized version of the physical
experimenter
$\mathbf{\widehat{S}}$
 on the system 
we introduce an imaginary
Cosmic Experimenter 
$\mathbf{\widehat{U}}$
who  inputs, propagates, and 
outtakes 
the cosmos;
a quantum version of Laplace's fictitious 
omniscient intellect.
The CE does experiments 
described by unitary operators $U$
with matrix elements
of the form
\BEq
\bra \tau=+T|U|\tau=-T\ket,
\EEq
where $2T$ is the duration of the experiment in
the proper time of the CE.
We imagine $\mathbf{\widehat{U}}$ measures
what
$\mathbf{\widehat{S}}$ measures;
and ignores
(traces over) what $\mathbf{\widehat{S}}$ ignores:
especially the proper time $\tau$ of the CE.  
Then cosmic energy
$E=(i/\hbar) d/d\tau$ is a central (``superselection'')
operator.

\section{Q/Q Kinematics}

Field theory began with classical fields on classical space-time (C/C),
evolved to quantum fields on classical space-time (Q/C),
and we can now formulate a Q/Q theory (quantum fields on quantum space-time).

Question: How do we define a  field space
\BEq
F=f^b
\EEq
with quantum fiber and base defined by mode spaces  $f, b$? By correspondence we
demand that these spaces admit a concept of dimension with
$\Dim f^b = (\Dim f)^{\Dim b}$.

Answer \cite{fs}: Set $f=(\surd\22)^{\phi}$.

Then 
\BE
\label{eq:F}
F=f^b := ((\surd\22)^{\phi})^b =(\surd\22)^{\phi\ox b}.
\EE
For this construction the field $f$ must be spinorial, of course.  So it is.



\section{Qubits to Qunats}

 We propose  to use the new algebraic
structure created by the $\Chi$ expansion
to make the observed bosons out of our fundamental
fermions. 
Fermion occupation numbers are quantum binary numbers
with eigenvalues 
$b=0, 1$: {\em qubits}.
A boson occupation number is a variable natural number 
with eigenvalues
$n=0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$:  a {\em qunat}.
We have to make qunats out of qubits.

It is easy to make ``nats'' (natural numbers)
out of bits;
evidently 1 nat = $\infty$ bits.
Likewise 1 qunat = $\infty$ qubits.
Here is one way of making a qunat $(q,p)$ from $N$ qubits
$\ga(i,n)$, 
$i=0,1,2, \quad 0\le n \le N$
in the limit $N\to \infty$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{q} &=& Q\;\Si_n \ga^{01}(n),\cr
\widehat{p} &=&P \;\Si_n \ga^{02}(n),\cr
\widehat{\imath} &=&N^{-1}\;\Si_n \ga^{12}(n),\cr
\widehat{q} \x \widehat{p}&=&\widehat{i},\cr
\widehat{\imath} \x \widehat{q}&=&\hbar'\widehat{p},\cr
\widehat{p} \x \widehat{\imath}&=&\hbar''\widehat{q},\cr
\widehat{\imath}^2&=&-1.\cr
2 NQP&=&1 , \quad 2 Q=N \hbar, \quad 2P Q=\hbar'.
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\hbar',\hbar'' << 1$
are Segal ultraquantum constants and
the value of the qunat is
the usual oscillator Hamiltonian
$H={\om\over 2} (p^2+q^2) - H_0$
with minimum eigenvalue $H_0$ reset to 0
by subtraction.
For finite $J, Q, P$, however --- and this is
supposedly the actuality ---
these are not oscillators but rotators,
namely spins,
and the nat is bounded by $2l+1$.


\section{Covariant Finite Toy Q/Q Kinematics}


The above $\Cliff(3,3)$ is a toy:
the least Clifford algebra expanding and stabilizing
the Poincar\'e and Heisenberg Lie algebras.
It doesn't accommodate the standard model.
In quantum set theory,
after the Dirac algebra $C^{2}=\Cliff(1,3)$
comes $C^{3}=\Cliff(10,6)$,
a Clifford algebra 
over a 16-dimensional space instead of a 6-dimensional one.
The additional 10 dimensions might accommodate the GUT,
and 16 resonates with the Cartan-Atiyah-Singer-Botts
octal periods. 

Let us apply the Q/Q field construction (\ref{eq:F}) to the $\Cliff(3,3)$  toy:
 \begin{eqnarray*}
\phi&=&\surd \Cliff(3,3)\sim\28 ,\cr
f&=&(\surd\22)^{\phi}\sim (\surd{\22})^{8}\sim \21\26.
\end{eqnarray*}
The number of qubits per cell in this toy is 16.
The main thing is that the number is finite and the theory is covariant.
