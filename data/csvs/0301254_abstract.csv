In this work we probe the Born-Infeld (BI) black hole in the
isolated horizon framework. It turns out that the BI black
hole is consistent with the heuristic model for colored
black holes proposed by Ashtekar {\it et al} 
[(2001){\it Class.Quant.Grav.} {\bf18} 919-940].
The model points to the unstability of the BI black hole.
