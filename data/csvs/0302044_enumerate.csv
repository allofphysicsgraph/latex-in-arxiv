\item \textbf{mass independence}: the squared mass $m^2$ gets renormalized
multiplicatively, and the massless theory corresponds to $m^2 = 0$.
\item \textbf{beta functions determine the subtractions}: the
subtractions necessary to get ultraviolet finiteness are completely
determined by the beta function and anomalous dimensions.

\item The new theory has the squared mass $m^2 (1 + \ep)$, and the
propagator is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{K(p)}{p^2 + m^2 (1+\ep)}
\end{equation}
\item If $s (p) = - \eta$, Eqs.~(\ref{Vtwoprime}, \ref{Vprime}) would
be nothing but the addition of the naive counterterms.
\item For $p^2 > 1$, $s(p)$ is momentum dependent, and it depends also
on the mass shift.
\item The new theory is physically equivalent to the original, since
they are related simply by an infinitesimal linear change of field
variables.  More specifically, the Green functions are related by
\begin{equation}
\vev{\phi (p_1) \cdots \phi (p_{2n-1}) \phi}_{m^2; \V}
= (1 - n \eta) \vev{\phi (p_1) \cdots \phi (p_{2n-1}) \phi}_{m^2
(1+\ep); \V'}
\end{equation}
if $p_i^2 < 1$ for all $i$.

\item $\beta (-t)$, $\beta_m (-t)$, $\gamma (-t)$ are determined by
$\lambda$ and $t$, since these are determined by the vertices $A_6
(-t;q,-q,0,0,0,0; \lambda)$, $A_4 (-t; q,-q,p,-p; \lambda)$, $B_4 (-t;
q,-q,0,0;\lambda)$.
\item Given an ERG trajectory, we can take any point along the
trajectory as the origin $t=0$.  No matter where we start, we can
reproduce the entire trajectory by solving the integral equations.  In
other words, the following scaling relation holds:
\begin{equation}
\V_{2n} (-t-\Delta t; p_1,\cdots,p_{2n}; m^2, \lambda) = \V_{2n} (-t;
p_1,\cdots, p_{2n}; m^2 (-\Delta t), \lambda (-\Delta t)) \label{scaling}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t$ is an arbitrary shift.  This is because the
conditions (\ref{tdepconditions}) are preserved under the modified ERG
transformation.

\item there are only two free parameters instead of four
\item the scaling relation (\ref{altscaling}) is valid for the
vertices

\item It is based upon a careless treatment of counterterms. (See
the first paragraph in sect.~\ref{sec:counter}.)
\item The renormalization scheme adopted is not mass independent.
