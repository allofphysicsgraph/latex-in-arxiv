\begin{abstract}
In this article we construct the chirality and 
Dirac operators on noncommutative $AdS_2$.     
We also derive the discrete spectrum of the Dirac operator which  is 
important in the study of the spectral triple associated to $AdS_2$. It is shown that 
the degeneracy of the spectrum present in the commutative $AdS_2$ is lifted 
in the noncommutative case. The way we construct the 
chirality operator is suggestive of how to introduce the projector operators 
of the corresponding projective modules on this space.

\section{Introduction}
Recently there has been much interest in applying the  Connes spectral triple approach to 
the study of  noncommutative manifolds such as fuzzy sphere and noncommutative $S^4$ 
\cite{BAE, CON2}. 
In this approach one starts with an algebra $\cal A$ (say the algebra of functions 
on the underlying manifold $X$), a Hilbert space $\cal H$ which is a representation of $\cal A$, 
and a Dirac operator $D$ which acts on $\cal H$. Having the triple 
$({\cal A}, {\cal H}, D)$, the geometry and topology of $X$ can be determined \cite{CON}. 
For example, the distance formula is given in terms of $D$, and knowing the spectrum 
of $D$, allows one to do the integration over $X$.   

Fuzzy sphere is the simplest example of a curved 
noncommutative manifold for which the 
spectral triple has been explicitly worked out \cite{ WATA1, WATA2}. 
Another two dimensional and non-flat example that comes to mind is the fuzzy  (noncommutative) $AdS_2$.  
Fuzzy $AdS_2$ naturally appears  
in the study of a variant form of (noncommutative) AdS/CFT 
correspondence in two dimensions \cite{HO}. 
Note that the isometry group of $AdS_2$ is $SO(2,1)$, 
and to get the fuzzy version of $AdS_2$, one 
promotes the coordinates defining the embedding of the surface in $R^{2+1}$ 
from ordinary functions to the generators of the group $SU(1,1)$. The embedding and the 
algebra satisfied by the coordinates are invariant under the automorphism group $SO(2,1)$  of the algebra and hence the name 
fuzzy $AdS_2$. 

For fuzzy sphere, a knowledge of the Dirac operator and its spectrum has allowed 
the authors of \cite{BAE} to 
compute the Chern numbers of the associated 
projective module ${\cal M}$ on fuzzy sphere.  
Here we will follow  \cite{WATA1, WATA2} to construct the Dirac operator on fuzzy 
$AdS_2$, and derive its discrete spectrum. 
In particular, we will find that the discrete spectrum of $D$ is nondegenerate. This should be contrasted with the commutative $AdS_2$ case where the discrete spectrum of $D$ is degenerate.  By this, we provide the spectral triple of fuzzy 
$AdS_2$. One may wish to build modules on this space, and, for instance, study 
the Yang-Mills theory on it. We introduce one such projective modules by constructing its 
corresponding projector on the fuzzy $AdS_2$. To compute the Chern number of these 
modules, however, one has to adapt the Connes formula to the case of noncompact algebras. 

In the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics on $AdS_2$, 
in \cite{FAKH} the spectrum of the Dirac operator, and the corresponding spinors for 
a charged particle with 
spin $\frac{1}{2}$ -- in the presence of a magnetic monopole --   
was successfully derived. There it was shown that the Dirac
spinors represent an ${\cal N}=1$ chiral supersymmetry algebra and a unitary 
parasupersymmetry algebra of an arbitrary order. Along the lines of \cite{POLY,BURES,TRA},  
it is interesting to see how 
these results are modified on fuzzy $AdS_2$. This is one of our 
motivations to study the Dirac operator on fuzzy $AdS_2$. 


\section{$\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermiticity and $AdS_2$ } 

In this section we study a special representation for the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$. 
This we choose to be a non-unitary representation given by $2\times 2$ matrices. 
In this representation, the 
$\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermiticity -- which will be defined shortly -- structure of the 
algebra is very clear. 
Then we will introduce an appropriate inner product between the elements of 
the Hilbert space on which $su(1,1)$ acts. This will induce the $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermiticity 
structure of the algebra on to the Hilbert space \cite{MOST}. 
The $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermiticity concept will become important when we come to 
discuss the spectrum of the Dirac operator on fuzzy $AdS_2$.
   
For every irreducible unitary finite dimensional representation of
the compact semisimple Lie group $SU(2)$, one can analytically continue 
the representation to a finite dimensional necessarily non-unitary representation of
the noncompact semisimple Lie group $SU(1,1)\cong SL(2,I\!\!R)$. Both Lie groups $SU(2)$ and $SU(1,1)$ have a common maximal compact subgroup
$U(1)$, and a common complexification which is the 
Lie group $SL(2,C\hspace{-3mm}1\,\,)$. 
Considering the lowest dimensional irreducible
representation of the Lie algebra $su(2)$, which is represented by the
Pauli matrices $\si_1$, $\si_2$ and $\si_3$, one can construct a two
dimensional non-unitary representation of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$
\be 
\Si_1 =i \si_1\hspace{10mm}
\Si_2=i \si_2 \hspace{10mm} \Si_3=\si_3 \,\, . \label{SSHH}
\ee 
It is straightforward to show that 
\be \Si_i
\Si_j=-\eta_{ij}I + i C_{ij}^{\ \ k} \Si_k \, , \label{SS} 
\ee 
where the
indices are raised and lowered by $\et_{ij}= (1,1,-1)$. The
structure constants $C_{ijk}$'s are completely anti-symmetric in
their indices, and our convention is $C_{123}=1$. 
If we parametrize the Lie group $SU(1,1)$  of $2\times 2$ matrices
of unit determinant as $U=exp(\frac{i}{2}\theta^i \Si_i)$, they will 
satisfy the following $\Si_3$-pseudo-unitary 
relation 
\be 
U^{\dagger}\Si_3U=U\Si_3U^{\dagger}=\Si_3\, \, \label{PSOU}. 
\ee
In the next section, we will see how this property of $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermiticity 
gets extended to the Dirac operator on noncommutative $AdS_2$.
The relation (\ref{PSOU}) induces essentially the property of
$\Si_3$-self-adjoint on $2 \times 2$ representation of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$
\be
\Si_i^{\dagger}=\Si_3 \Si_i \Si_3 \,\,  \label{PSOH}\, ,
\ee 
where we note that the operator $\Si_3$ is self-adjoint, involutory and unitary 
\be 
\Si_3^{\dagger}=\Si_3
\hspace{10mm} \Si_3^{2}=I \hspace{10mm}
\Si_3^{-1}=\Si_3^{\dagger}\, \, \, . 
\ee 
Therefore, the Lie algebra space
$su(1,1)$ is said to be pseudo-Hermitian with respect to $\Si_3$ (or
equivalently, we say $su(1,1)$ is $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermitian). The eigenvalues of
$\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermitian operators are known to be either real or
appear  in complex-conjugates pairs. 
Let the linear operator $u:{\cal H}\rightarrow {\cal H}$ be an arbitrary element
of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$ acting on a separable Hilbert space
${\cal H}$. $u$ is expressed as a linear combination of the
traceless $2\times 2$ matrices $\Si_1$, $\Si_2$ and $\Si_3$ with
real determinants. 
If we define the $\Si_3$-adjoint for
every $\Psi$ belonging to the Hilbert space ${\cal H}$ as 
\be
\overline{\Psi}=\Psi^{\dagger}\Si_3\, \, , 
\ee 
then we can introduce a 
natural indefinite inner product ``$\ast$"" of the two arbitrary elements
$\Psi$ and $\Phi$ belonging to the Hilbert space ${\cal H}$, as 
\be
\Psi\ast\Phi=\overline{\Psi}\Phi\, \, . 
\ee 
This  has the
following property for every arbitrary element $u$ of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$ 
\be
\Psi\ast \left(u\Phi\right)=
\overline{\Psi}u\Phi=\Psi^{\dagger}\Si_3u\Phi=\Psi^{\dagger}u^{\dagger}\Si_3\Phi
=\left(u\Psi\right)^{\dagger}\Si_3\Phi=
\overline{\left(u\Psi\right)}\Phi=\left(u\Psi\right)\ast \Phi \, \, , 
\ee 
which means that all the generators belonging to $su(1,1)$ are
$\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermitian with respect to the inner product ``$\ast$"". 
A Hilbert space equipped with such an indefinite inner product
is called the Krein space \cite{AZIZ}. Using Eq. (\ref{SS}) the Lie and Clifford
algebras corresponding to the generators $\Si_i$ are obtained, 
respectively as  
\bea
&&[\Si_i , \Si_j]= 2i C_{ij}^{\ \ k} \Si_k  \\
&&\{\Si_i , \Si_j\}= -2 \eta_{ij} I\, \, . \label{ANTIS}
\eea
It is straightforward to show that the structure constants $C_{ij}^{\ \ k}$
satisfy the following relation 
\be
C_{im}^{\ \ \ k} \eta^{ij} C_{jl}^{\ \ n}=\eta_{m}^{\ \ n}\eta_{l}^{\ k}
- \eta_{ml} \eta^{kn}. \label{SABET} 
\ee

Next let us discuss the geometrical structure of the Euclidean $AdS_2$. 
The Euclidean $AdS_2=SU(1,1)/U(1)$
is defined through the following embedding in 3-dimensional flat Minkowskian space
 ($l>0$)
\be
{\bf x}\cdot{\bf x}:=x_i\eta^{ij}x_j=-l^2\, \, . \label{EMB}
\ee
This could also be thought of as the poincare upper half-plane $H^2=\{(x,y)\in I\!\! R^{2} : y>0\}$ with
the Riemannian metric
\be
ds^2=l^2 \frac{dx^2+dy^2}{y^2}\,\, .\label{MET}
\ee
If we make the following coordinates transformations 
\be
x=\frac{2\tanh\frac{\rh}{2} \sin\tau}{1+2\tanh\frac{\rh}{2}
\cos\tau +\tanh^2\frac{\rh}{2}} \hspace{20mm}
y=\frac{1-\tanh^2\frac{\rh}{2}}{1+2\tanh\frac{\rh}{2}
\cos\tau +\tanh^2\frac{\rh}{2}}\, ,
\ee
the metric (\ref{MET}) will transform to 
\be
ds^2 =l^2 (d\rh^2 + \sinh ^2\rh \, d\tau^2 )\,\, . \label{METRIC}
\ee
The above metric can also be obtained by simply inserting the 
embedding coordinates
\bea
&& x_1= l\sinh \rh \cos \tau \\ \nn
&& x_2 =l\sinh \rh \sin \tau \\ \nn 
&& x_3=l\cosh \rho \nn 
\eea
into the Minkowskian metric 
\bea
ds^2=dx_1^2 +dx_2^2 -dx_3^2\, .
\eea
Also note that the metric (\ref{METRIC}) has a negative scalar curvature $R=-2/l^2$. 


\section{ $U(1)$ principal fiber bundles over $AdS_2$}

For the sake of completeness, here we discuss the Hopf construction of 
the $U(1)$ bundles over $AdS_2$. This will prove useful in the 
discussion of the noncommutative analogue of bundles over $AdS_2$, i.e., 
the construction of projective modules over fuzzy $AdS_2$. 
 
The $U(1)$ principal fiberation $\pi$ of the total space $AdS_3$
over $AdS_2$ can be realized as follows. First we define the total space 
in ${C\hspace{-3mm}1}^{\hspace{1mm}2}$ through the embedding 
\be
AdS_3=\left\{\left(z_1,z_2\right)\in {C\hspace{-3mm}1}^{\hspace{1mm}2}, \hspace{5mm} \left|z_1\right|^2
-\left|z_2\right|^2=-l^2\right\}\, . \label{ADS3}
\ee
In the framework of principal fiber bundle, this is projected over the base manifold 
$AdS_2$ as 
\be
U(1)\stackrel{\mbox{right}\hspace{1mm} U(1)-\mbox{action}}{\hookrightarrow} AdS_3
\stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} AdS_2 \,.
\ee
The right $U(1)$-action transforms the point $\left(z_1,z_2\right)$
of $AdS_3$ onto another point of $AdS_3$ 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{llll}
&&\nonumber\\
&&\left.
\begin{array}{llll}
&&AdS_3 \times U(1)\rightarrow  AdS_3 \\
&&\left(z_1,z_2\right)w=\left(z_1w,z_2w\right)
\end{array}
\right\}
\rightarrow \left|z_1w\right|^2-\left|z_2w\right|^2 =\left|z_1\right|^2
-\left|z_2\right|^2=-l^2\,.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
The complex Hopf bundle projection $\pi:AdS_3\rightarrow AdS_2$ is given by 
\bea
&&x_1=\frac{1}{l}\left(z_1{\bar z}_2+z_2{\bar z}_1\right) \nonumber \\
&&x_2=\frac{i}{l}\left(z_1{\bar z}_2-z_2{\bar z}_1\right)  \nonumber \\
&&x_3=\frac{1}{l}\left(\left|z_1\right|^2+\left|z_2\right|^2\right)\, .
\label{BUNMAP}
\eea
The relation (\ref{EMB}) can be directly checked. The sections of this $U(1)$ 
bundle over the base manifold $AdS_2$ are then the inverse of 
(\ref{BUNMAP}), i.e.,
\bea
\left|z_1\right|^2 =\frac{l}{2}\left(x_3-l\right)\hspace{10mm}
\left|z_2\right|^2 =\frac{l}{2}\left(x_3+l\right)\hspace{10mm}
z_1{\bar z}_2=\frac{l}{2}\left(x_1-ix_2\right)\,.
\label{REBUNMAP}
\eea
Moreover, the Hopf fibration of $U(1)$ bundles over $AdS_2$ can also be expressed 
in the group theoretical framework as follows.   
There is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between the points on $AdS_3$ and 
the elements of $SU(1,1)$, $g:AdS_3\rightarrow SU(1,1)$. 
It is sufficient to choose the one-to-one map $g$
as 
\begin{eqnarray}
g\left( \begin{array}{cc} z_1
\\ z_2
\end{array} \right)=\frac{1}{l} \left( \begin{array}{cc} {\bar z}_2 & iz_1
\\ -i{\bar z}_1  & z_2
\end{array} \right)=:U\, ,
\end{eqnarray}
in which $z_1$ and $z_2$ are arbitrary elements of $AdS_3$. It is easy to
check that it has the unit determinant, and also, satisfies $\Si_3$-pseudo-unitary
relation (\ref{PSOU}). The homogeneous manifold $SU(1,1)/U(1)$ can be obtained by
the Hopf projection as 
\begin{eqnarray}
\pi\left(U\right):=lU\Si_3U^{-1}=-{\bf x}\cdot{\bf \Si}\, , \label{PUS}
\end{eqnarray}
where the coordinates $x_i$ (for homogeneous manifold $SU(1,1)/U(1)$)
are obtained from the complex coordinates $z_1$ and $z_2$
(for the group manifold $SU(1,1)$) via Eqs. (\ref{BUNMAP}).
The right $U(1)$-action over $SU(1,1)$ keeps the base point ${\bf x}$
fixed in the sence that all the elements
$U exp\left(\frac{i}{2}\theta^3\Si_3\right)$ of $SU(1,1)$ are projected
onto the same point ${\bf x}$ on the base manifold
$SU(1,1)/U(1)$. Therefore, we can identify any equivalance class
$\left[U\right]=U exp\left(\frac{i}{2}\theta^3\Si_3\right)\in SU(1,1)/U(1)$
with the point ${\bf x}\in AdS_2$ via the projection map (\ref{PUS}).

\section{Noncommutative $AdS_2$ and finite dimensional Schwinger representation 
of the algebra ${\cal A}_N$}

As mentioned in introduction, to define the fuzzy $AdS_2$, we promote the 
coordinates $x_i$'s of $AdS_2$ to play the role of the generators of 
$su(1,1)$, in some unitary representation. For a given integer $N$ ($N>2$), 
let (${\cal A}_N$,${\cal L}_N$) denote the space of all analytic functions 
of coordinates, and derivations on fuzzy $AdS_2$, respectively. As in the 
case of fuzzy sphere we can work out a Schwinger representation for ${\cal A}_N$.   
To start with, introduce a real parameter 
$\al$ controling the strength of the noncommutativity, and take the coordinates $x_i$'s 
to satisfy the relation
\be
\left[x_i , x_j\right]= i\al C_{ij}^{\ \ k} x_k \, , \label{CMX}
\ee
such that $\f{2}{ \al}x^i$'s satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$.
Like $SU(2)$, the Lie group $SU(1,1)$ is a group of rank $1$, and so possesses one invariant
Casimir operator whose eigenvalues label the irreducible representations.
The noncommutative relation (\ref{CMX}) together with the embedding (\ref{EMB}), 
which now ascribes a negative constant
value to the Casimir operator, defines the noncommutative
$AdS_2$. In fact, this is an analytic continuation of the noncommutative structure of the fuzzy sphere to that of $AdS_2$ via the metric $\et_{ij}$.  
The passage from the fuzzy sphere to the noncommutative $AdS_2$
is equivalent analytically to the passage from the ordinary Euclidean Clifford algebra 
to the Minkowskian Clifford algebra. 

The generators $L_i$ of ${\cal L}_N$ are defined by the adjoint action of 
$x_i$ on the space ${\cal A}_N$:
\be
\frac{1}{\alpha}ad_{x_i}x_j=\frac{1}{\alpha}\left[x_i,x_j\right]=:L_ix_j\, \label{DERIV}.
\ee
This induces the commutation relations of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$ on ${\cal L}_N$ 
\be
\left[L_i , L_j\right]= i C_{ij}^{\ \ k} L_k \, . \label{CML}
\ee
The bigger algebra (${\cal A}_N$ , ${\cal L}_N$) includes the commutation relations
(\ref{CMX}) and  (\ref{CML}), as well as
\be
\left[L_i , x_j\right]= i C_{ij}^{\ \ k} x_k \, .  \label{LX}
\ee

We are now going to introduce a version of the Schwinger operator bases which realizes a representation of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$ using the $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermitian matrices (\ref{SSHH}). In this formulation, one considers the elements of ${\cal A}_N$
acting on a finite dimensional Hilbert space ${\cal F}_N$ spanned by a set of 
orthonormal bases $\left\{\left|k\right\rangle\right\}_{k=0}^{k=N-2}$.
Then, the algebra ${\cal A}_N$ can be identified with the algebra of 
$(N-1)\times (N-1)$ complex matrices, which act on an $(N-1)$-dimensional Hilbert space
${\cal F}_N$. According to the discussion above, the Hilbert space ${\cal F}_N$ can be constructed by acting a pair of creation and annihilation operators ${{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{b}$ and ${\bf a}^{b}$ 
($b=1$, $2$) on the vacuum state $\left|0\right\rangle$, i.e.,
\be
\left|k\right\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{k!(N-2-k)!}}\left({{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{1}\right)^k
\left({{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{2}\right)^{N-2-k}\left|0\right\rangle \, \hspace{20mm}k=0,1, 
\cdots ,N-2 \, ,
\ee 
where the commutation relations are
\be
\left[{\bf a}^{a} , {\bf a}^{b}\right]=\left[{{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{a} , 
{{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{b}\right]=0 \hspace{20mm}
\left[{\bf a}^{a} , 
{{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{b}\right]=\delta^a_b \, .
\ee
The number operator 
${\bf N}:={{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{b}{\bf a}^{b}$ has the eigenvalue $N-2$ over 
the Hilbert space ${\cal F}_N$ 
\be
{\bf N}|_{_{{\cal F}_N}}=N-2 \,.
\ee

The Schwinger representation for the bases of the algebra ${\cal A}_N$ is now represented
as follows
\be
x_i=\frac{1}{2}\al \left(\Si_{i}\right)^a_{\, \, b} {{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{a} 
{\bf a}^{b}\,. \label{SCH}
\ee
It is straightforward to see that the generators (\ref{SCH}) satisfy the algebra of noncommutative $AdS_2$ (\ref{CMX}), as well as the following commutation relations:
\bea
\left[x_i , {{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{a}\right]=\frac{1}{2}\al \left(\Si_{i}\right)^b_{\, \, a} {{\bf a}^{\dagger}}_{b} \nonumber \\
\left[x_i , {\bf a}^{a}\right]=\frac{-1}{2}\al \left(\Si_{i}\right)^a_{\,\, b} 
{\bf a}^{b}\, .
\eea
The Casimir operator of the generators (\ref{SCH}) is  
\be
{\bf x}\cdot{\bf x}=\frac{-\al^2}{4} {\bf N}({\bf N}+2) \,. \label{CASIMIR}
\ee
Restricting the equations over the Hilbert space ${\cal F}_N$, and 
comparing Eq. (\ref{EMB}) with (\ref{CASIMIR}), we conclude that
\be
\alpha=\frac{2l}{\sqrt{N(N-2)}} \, , \label{CONS}
\ee
which implies that 
the commutative limit $(\alpha\rightarrow 0)$ corresponds to the limit 
$N\rightarrow \infty$.


\section{Chirality and Dirac operators}

Our aim in this section is to construct the Dirac operator on 
fuzzy $AdS_2$. This is the most important ingredient in the 
Connes construction of noncommutative manifolds.  
To define the Dirac operator, however, first we need to introduce the 
chirality operator $\ga$. The existence of this latter operator provides a 
$Z_2$ grading of the Hilbert space ${\cal H}$. $\ga$ has the following properties:

\vspace{3mm} 

$\bullet$ Commutes with the elements of the algebra ${\cal A}_N$, and squares to one.

\vspace{3mm}

$\bullet$ Has a standard commutative limit.
\vspace{3mm}
\newline
This chirality operator, however, instead of being Hermitian as in 
the case of 
compact algebras, turns out to be $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermitian on fuzzy $AdS_2$.
The Dirac operator $D$ is then constructed such that: 

\vspace{3mm}

$\bullet$ It anticommutes with $\ga$. 

\vspace{3mm}

$\bullet$ Reduces to the conventional Dirac operator on commutative $AdS_2$ \cite{TRA}, when 
the noncommutativity parameter $\al$ is sent to zero. 
\vspace{3mm}\newline
Notice that the above requirements on $\ga$ and $D$ do not uniquely fix their representations. 
Let us represent the Dirac and chirality operators by the $2$-component spinors 
$\Psi=\left( \begin{array}{c}\psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{array}\right)$ as the elements of 
${\cal A}_N$-bimodule ${\cal H}:={C\hspace{-3mm}1}^{\hspace{1mm}2}\otimes {\cal A}_N$. 

Following \cite{WATA2}, to construct $\ga$, we introduce the
opposite algebra ${\cal A}_N^0$ with the product rule between the elements
\be
x_i^0 x_j^0 \equiv (x_j x_i)^0 \, .
\ee
In other words, the generators $x_i^0$, which form the opposite algebra ${\cal A}_N^0$, 
are acting from 
the right hand side on ${\cal A}_N$-bimodule:
\be
x_i^0 \Psi=\Psi x_i \hspace{20mm} \forall \Psi\in {\cal H}. \label{ZEROD}
\ee 
From these, we obtain the commutation relation of this algebra to be
\be
\left[x_i^0 , x_j^0\right]= -i\al C_{ij}^{\ \ k} x_k^0 \, . \label{ZERO}
\ee
Now let us define the chirality operator to be
\be
\ga =\f{1}{{\cal N}_N}(\Si_i \et^{ij}x_j^0 +\f{\al}{2}I)\, ,
\ee
where 
\be
{\cal N}_N =\sqrt{l^2+\frac{\al^2}{4}}  
=\frac{l(N-1)}{\sqrt{N(N-2)}}\,. \nn 
\ee
It is easy to check that $\ga$ is involutory, just note that
\bea
(\Si_i \et^{ij}x_j^0)(\Si_k \et^{kl}x_l^0) &=& 
\et^{ij}\et^{kl}(-\et_{ik}I +iC_{ik}^{\ \ n}\Si_n)x^0_jx^0_l \nn \\
&=& -\et^{jl}x^0_jx^0_l I +iC^{jln}\Si_nx^0_jx^0_l \nn \\
&=& l^2I +\f{\al}{2}C^{jln}C_{jl}^{\ \ r}\Si_nx^0_r \nn \\
&=& l^2I -\al\et^{nr}\Si_nx^0_r \, ,
\eea  
so 
\be
\ga^2 = \f{1}{{\cal N}_N^2}\lf(\f{\al^2}{4}I +\al\Si_i\et^{ij}x^0_j +l^2I 
-\al\Si_i\et^{ij}x^0_j\ri)=I\, .\label{GAMMA2}
\ee
Note that the chirality operator $\ga$ is constructed so 
that it commutes with the elements of
algebra ${\cal A}_N$. Moreover, since $\Si_i^\dag = \Si_3 \Si_i \Si_3$, 
it is $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermitian
\be
\ga^{\dagger}=\Si_3 \ga \Si_3 \,. \label{PSHER}
\ee

Next we introduce the Dirac operator
\be
D=\f{-i}{l\al}\ga\, C_{ij}^{\ \ k}\et^{il}\et^{jm}\Si_lx^0_m x_k\, . \label{DIRAC1}
\ee
In the following we show that $\ga$ anticommutes with $D$. 
First note that
\bea
(\et^{ij}\Si_ix_j^0)(\Si_lx_k^0)=\et^{ij}\Si_i\Si_l x_j^0x_k^0 &=& 
\et^{ij}(-\Si_l\Si_i -2\et_{il}I)(x^0_kx^0_j -i
\al C_{jk}^{\ \ r}x_r^0) \nn \\
&=& -(\Si_lx^0_k)(\et^{ij}\Si_ix^0_j) +i\al \et^{ij}C_{jk}^{\ \ 
r}\Si_l\Si_ix^0_r 
-2x^0_lx^0_k I \, ,
\eea 
where in the first line we have used Eq. (\ref{ANTIS}), and 
the relation 
(\ref{ZERO}). So we learn that
\bea
\lf\{ C_{ij}^{\ \ k}\et^{il}\et^{jm}\Si_l x_m^0 \, , \et^{ij}\Si_ix^0_j 
\ri\} &=& 
i\al C_{ij}^{\ \ k}C_{sm}^{\ \ p}\et^{il}\et^{jm}\et^{rs}\Si_l\Si_r 
x^0_p

&=& -\al \et^{nm}\et^{ks} C_{sm}^{\ \ p} \Si_nx^0_p \nn \\
&=& -\al \et^{ni}\et^{pj}C_{ij}^{\ \ k}\Si_n x^0_p \, .
\eea
The second and the third equality follow from Eqs. (\ref{SS}) and (\ref{SABET}). 
Since $x_i$ and $x_j^0$ commute with each other, we conclude that
\bea
\{D\, , \ga \} &=& \f{-i}{l\al {\cal N}_N}\ga 
\lf\{C_{ij}^{\ \ k}\et^{il}\et^{jm}\Si_l x_m^0 x_k\, , 
\et^{ij}\Si_ix^0_j \ri\} +
\f{\al}{{\cal N}_N}D \nn \\
&=& \f{i}{l{\cal N}_N}\ga C_{ij}^{\ \ k}\et^{il}\et^{jm}\Si_lx^0_m 
x_k+\f{\al}{{\cal N}_N} D\nn \\
&=& 0 \, .\label{ADIRAC}
\eea
Further, Eq. (\ref{PSHER}) implies that
\be
D^\dag = \Si_3 D \Si_3 \label{PDIRAC}\, , 
\ee
so it is $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermitian.

To proceed further and to discuss the commutative limit of the Dirac operator, 
there are some definitions and algebra among the operators in $({\cal A}_N , {\cal L}_N)$ that should be discussed.  
The commutation relations (\ref{CML}), (\ref{ZERO}) and also 
\be
\left[L_i , x_j^0\right]= i C_{ij}^{\ \ k} x_k^0 \,  \label{LZERO}
\ee
which is obtained from Eqs. (\ref{DERIV}) and (\ref{ZEROD}), define the algebra  
$\left({\cal A}_N^0 , {\cal L}_N\right)$ for the noncommutative $AdS_2$.
Note that the generators of the algebra ${\cal L}_N$ can also be written as a linear combination of the generators of the algebras ${\cal A}_N$ and ${\cal A}_N^0$ as 
\be
L_i = \alpha^{-1}\left(x_i - x_i^0\right). \label{LXX}
\ee
Introduce the following operators in  
$\left({\cal A}_N , {\cal L}_N\right)\otimes M_2(C\hspace{-3mm}1\,\,)$ 
\bea
&&\chi:=x_i \eta^{ij} \Si_j \\
&&\Lambda:=L_i \eta^{ij} \Si_j \\
&&\Sigma:=-i C_{ij}^{\ \ k} \eta^{il} \eta^{jm}x_l L_m \Si_k \, ,
\eea
which are invariant under the $SU(1,1)$ transformations.\footnote{Using the commutation relations of the algebra $({\cal A}_N , {\cal L}_N)$,  
the (anti)commutation relations of the operators $\chi$,
$\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ are 
\bea
\frac{1}{2}\left\{\chi , \chi\right\}&=&l^2+\alpha \chi \nonumber \\    
\frac{1}{2}\left\{\Lambda ,\Lambda\right\}&=&-{\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}+ \Lambda \nonumber \\
\frac{1}{2}\left\{\Si , \Si\right\}&=&-\alpha {\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}+l^2{\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}+\left({\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}\right)^2 
-\alpha \Si +\alpha {\bf x}\cdot{\bf L} \Lambda +l^2\Lambda\, , 
\nonumber \\ & & \nonumber \\ 
\left\{\chi , \Lambda\right\}&=&2\left(\chi-{\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}\right)  \nonumber \\
\left[\chi , \Lambda\right]&=&-2\left(\chi+\Si \right)\, , \nonumber \\ & & \nonumber \\
\left\{\Si , \Lambda\right\}&=&2\left(\Si+{\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}\right)  \nonumber \\
\left[\Si , \Lambda\right]&=&2\left(\chi {\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}-\Lambda {\bf x}\cdot{\bf L} \right)\, , \nonumber \\ & & \nonumber \\
\left\{\Si , \chi\right\}&=& -2 l^2 +\alpha \left(\Si-\chi\right)  \nonumber \\  
\left[\Si , \chi\right]&=& -2 l^2 \left(I-\Lambda\right)-2 \alpha {\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}
+\left\{\chi , {\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}\right\}. \nonumber
\eea} 
Using Eq. (\ref{PSOH}), one can easily show that 
\bea
\chi^{\dagger}&=&\Si_3 \chi \Si_3     \label{PSX} \\
\Lambda^{\dagger}&=&\Si_3 \Lambda \Si_3     \label{PLX}\\
\Sigma^{\dagger}&=&-\Si_3\left(\Sigma+2\chi \right)  \Si_3 \, .  \label{PSIX}
\eea
 
If we define\footnote{Note that the generators 
$J_i$ are $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermitian with respect 
to the inner product ``$\ast$"" defined in the ${\cal A}_N$-bimodule 
${\cal H}:={C\hspace{-2.5mm}1}^{\hspace{1mm}2}\otimes {\cal A}_N$, because
\[
\Psi\ast \left(J_i\Phi\right)=
\Psi^{\dagger}\Si_3\left(L_i+\frac{1}{2}\Si_i\right)\Phi=\Psi^{\dagger}
\left(L_i+\frac{1}{2}\Si_i^{\dagger}\right)\Si_3\Phi
=\left(\left(L_i+\frac{1}{2}\Si_i\right)\Psi\right)^{\dagger}\Si_3\Phi=
\left(J_i\Psi\right)\ast \Phi \, \,. \nn
\] 
Also note that the generators 
$J_i$, which like the bases of  
${\cal A}_N$ and ${\cal L}_N$, constitute the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$, satisfy the 
following commutation relations
\[
\left[L_i , J_j\right]= i C_{ij}^{\ \ k} L_k \nn \, \, . 
\]}
\be
J_i=L_i+\frac{1}{2} \Si_i \label{JLS} \, ,
\ee
and
\be
\Omega_i=C_{ij}^{\ \ k} \eta^{jl} x_l \Si_k 
\ee
then, using Eqs. (\ref{SS}), (\ref{SABET}) and (\ref{CMX}), it follows that
\be
C_{ij}^{\ \ k} \eta^{il} \eta^{jm} \Si_l x_m^0 x_k= - \alpha {\bf \Omega}\cdot{\bf J}
=i \alpha \left(\Si + \chi \right) \, .  \label{OJSX}
\ee
Therefore the Dirac operator 
can be written in the following compact forms
\be
D=\frac{i}{l} \ga {\bf \Omega}\cdot{\bf J}=\frac{1}{l} \ga 
\left(\Si + \chi \right) \, .\label{DOJ}
\ee
In this form the $\Si_3$-pseudo-Hermiticity relation (\ref{PDIRAC}) can easily be 
derived from the second equality in (\ref{DOJ}) upon taking its dagger and using Eqs. 
(\ref{GAMMA2}), (\ref{PSHER}), (\ref{ADIRAC}), (\ref{PSX}) and (\ref{PSIX}). 

Now let us discuss the status of the Casimir operators in ${\cal L}_N$. Unlike 
the commutative case where the only Casimir is ${\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}$, here we get 
an additional Casimir operator. Though, it will  
scale to zero in the commutative limit $\al\to 0$. 
First of all, it is clear that the operator 
${\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}$, the Casimir operator of the 
bases of the algebra ${\cal L}_N$, satisfies the following relation 
\be
\left[L_i , {\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}\right]=0 \, .\label{LLL}
\ee
On the other hand, from the commutation relations (\ref{CML})
and (\ref{LX}), one obtains
\be
\left[L_i , {\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}\right]=0  \, ,   \label{LXL}
\ee
giving the second Casimir mentioned above. If we define 
the generalized momentum operators
\be
P_i=-i C_{ij}^{\ \ k} \eta^{jl} x_l L_k \, ,   \label{PPP}
\ee
which are invariant under the $SU(1,1)$ group transformations, 
we can obtain the following relations in the algebra 
$({\cal A}_N , {\cal L}_N)$ 
\bea
&&\left[x_i , {\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}\right]=2 \left(x_i+ P_i\right)  \label{XLLP} \\
&&\left[x_i , {\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}\right]=\alpha \left(x_i+ P_i\right)\,.  \label{XXLP}
\eea
And finally, one can obtain
the action of both operators ${\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}$ and ${\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}$
on the polynomials in the 
algebra ${\cal A}_N$ using the inductive procedure $(n=1,2,3,\cdots)$
\bea
&&{\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}\left(x_i\right)^n= -2 n \left(x_i\right)^n    \label{LL}  \\
&&{\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}\left(x_i\right)^n= - n \alpha \left(x_i\right)^n \,.  \label{XL}
\eea 
Comparing Eqs. (\ref{LLL}) and (\ref{LXL}), (\ref{XLLP}) and
(\ref{XXLP}), and also, (\ref{LL})  and (\ref{XL}), it is readily
found that
\be
{\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}=\frac{\alpha}{2} {\bf L}\cdot{\bf L} \, ,   \label{XLLL}
\ee
which shows that the commutative limit is reached when $\alpha\rightarrow 0$. 
 
We notice that in the commutative limit $\alpha\rightarrow 0$ 
( or $N\rightarrow \infty$ ), the generators of the opposite algebra, $x_i^0$'s, 
get transformed into the generators of ${\cal A}_N$, i.e. 
$x_i$'s. Therefore, using Eqs. (\ref{SS}) and (\ref{SABET}) we get
\be
D_{\infty}=-\left(\Lambda-I\right)-\frac{1}{l^2}\chi {\bf x}\cdot{\bf L}\, . \label{DINFTY}
\ee
However, taking into account the relation (\ref{XLLL}), the second term of $D_{\infty}$ also vanishes, and we are left with
\be
D_{\infty}=-\left(\Lambda-I\right)\, , \label{DINFT}
\ee
which is in agreement with the results of \cite{TRA}.
Therefore Dirac operator (\ref{DIRAC1}) 
reduces to the conventional Dirac operator on
commutative $AdS_2$ when
the noncommutativity parameter $\al$ is sent to zero. 



Before concluding this section, let us briefly discuss the related subject of 
projective modules on fuzzy $AdS_2$. Projective modules are analogue of fiber 
bundles on noncommutative spaces. So if we are to study, for instance, the Yang-Mills 
theory on noncommutative spaces, the concept of projective modules becomes 
indispensable. 
To construct a projective module, of a rank say 2, we proceed as follows. 
First we introduce a projector $p$, which is a 2$\times$2 matrix 
with elements in the algebra ${\cal A}$. This, in turn, allows us to 
define the projective 
module ${\cal M}= p\, {\cal A}^2 $ of sections $s\in \cA ^2$ such that $p\circ s =s$. 
The connection 
$\nabla = p\circ d$ on ${\cal M}$ 
is then a map from sections to one-form valued sections in ${\cal M}$. 

From what we did in the case of chirality operator $\ga$, which squares 
to $I$, it is not difficult to guess the form of $p$. We define
\be
p=\f{1}{2}(I+\Pi)\, ,\label{P}
\ee
where
\be
\Pi =\f{1}{{\cal N}_N}({\widetilde \Si}_i \et^{ij}x_j-\f{\al}{2}I)\, ,
\ee
such that $\Pi^2 =I$, therefore $p^2=p$ and $p$ is a projector.
Note that in the above, ${\widetilde \Si}_i$'s are again the 2-dimensional 
representations of the $su(1,1)$ generators such that 
$[{\widetilde \Si}_i , \Si_j]=0$. Now, as mentioned earlier, $p$ 
defines the projective module ${\cal M}= p\, {\cal A}^2$ over ${\cal A}$ with 
the sections $s\in \cA ^2$ such that $p\circ s =s$.
Let us introduce the differential operator $d$ through
\be
du=i[D , u]\, ,
\ee 
for any $u$ in the Lie algeba of $su(1,1)$. If $s$ is a section of the 
projective module ${\cal M}$ then $s=p\circ s$, and we define the connection 
on ${\cal M}$ to be $\nabla =d\circ p$. Therefore the curvature of $\cal M$ is 
$\nabla^2= p dp^2$ with the first Chern class of 
\be
C_1(p)=\tr(pdp^2)\, .\label{C}
\ee
For compact algebras, the first Chern number of ${\cal M}$ is then calculated by 
taking the Dixmier trace over the Hilbert space ${\cal H}$. The formula for the 
first Chern number is \cite{CON}
\be
c_1(p)=-{\mbox{Tr}}_w \lf(\f{1}{|D|^2}\ga \,  p [D,p][D,p] \ri)\, ,\label{CHERN}
\ee
where $|D|=\sqrt{D^{\dagger} D}$. For the projective module defined by the 
projector (\ref{P}), it is straightforward to compute the first Chern class 
defined in (\ref{C}). But to calculate the first Chern number and to see whether 
the associated module is nontrivial needs a modification of the Connes formula 
(\ref{CHERN}) to the case of noncompact algebras. This is a problem that we would like 
to further study in future works.  


\section{The discrete spectrum of Dirac operator on noncommutative $AdS_2$}

In order to analyze the spectrum of the Dirac operator on noncommutative $AdS_2$,
first note that using Eqs. (\ref{EMB}) and (\ref{CONS}) we can write 
\be
{\bf X}\cdot{\bf X}={\bf X^0}\cdot{\bf X^0}=\frac{-N}{2}\left(\frac{N}{2}-1\right)\, ,   \label{XXXX}
\ee
where 
\be
X_i=\alpha^{-1} x_i \hspace{20mm} X_i^0=-\alpha^{-1} x_i^0 \,. \label{XAX}
\ee
The square of the Dirac operator, on the other hand, is calculated by using 
Eqs. (\ref{SS}), (\ref{SABET}), (\ref{CMX}), (\ref{ZERO}), and the definition 
(\ref{DIRAC1}) 
\be
\frac{l^2}{\alpha^2}D^2={\bf X}\cdot{\bf X}\,{\bf X^0}\cdot{\bf X^0} 
-{\bf X}\cdot{\bf X^0}\left({\bf X}\cdot{\bf X^0}-I+{\bf \Si}\cdot\left({\bf X}+{\bf X^0}\right)\right).   \label{DXXXX}
\ee
This can be simplified further using (\ref{LXX}) and (\ref{JLS})
\bea
&&{\bf X}\cdot{\bf X^0}=\frac{1}{2}\left({\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}-{\bf X}\cdot{\bf X}-{\bf X^0}\cdot{\bf X^0}\right)  \label{XXSQ}   \\
&&{\bf \Si}\cdot\left({\bf X}+{\bf X^0}\right)={\bf J}\cdot{\bf J}-{\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}
+\frac{3}{4}I \,,  \label{SXXJJ}
\eea
the last equation is obtained noticing 
$\left(\frac{1}{2}{\bf \Si}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}{\bf \Si}\right)
=-s(s-1)I$ with $s=\frac{-1}{2}$.
Finally, applying Eqs. (\ref{XXSQ}) and (\ref{SXXJJ}), the square of Dirac operator 
transforms to the form
\bea
\frac{l^2}{\alpha^2}D^2&=&{\bf X}\cdot{\bf X}\,{\bf X^0}\cdot{\bf X^0} 
-\frac{1}{2}\left({\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}-{\bf X}\cdot{\bf X}-{\bf X^0}\cdot{\bf X^0}\right)
\nonumber\\
&&\times \left[\frac{1}{2}\left({\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}-{\bf X}\cdot{\bf X}-{\bf X^0}\cdot{\bf X^0}\right) 
+{\bf J}\cdot{\bf J}-{\bf L}\cdot{\bf L}
-\frac{1}{4}I\right]\,.   \label{DSQR}
\eea

There are four classes of irreducible representations of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$.
The first and the second classes include two principal discrete representations, which are realized in the Hilbert space through 
\be
{\cal D}^{\pm}(j)=\left\{\left| j,m_j \right\rangle : \hspace{5mm} j>0, \hspace{5mm} m_j=\pm j,  \pm\left(j+1\right),   \pm\left(j+2\right),\cdots \right\} \label{DPM}
\ee
where
\be
{\bf J}^2 \left| j,m_j \right\rangle=-j(j-1)\left| j,m_j \right\rangle ,  \hspace{25mm} 
J_3 \left| j,m_j \right\rangle=m_j\left| j,m_j \right\rangle \,. 
\label{REPRE}
\ee
It is clear that the state $\left| j,j \right\rangle$ has the lowest weight $j$ in the 
Hilbert space ${\cal D}^{+}(j)$, while the state $\left| j,-j \right\rangle$ has the highest
weight $-j$ in the Hilbert space ${\cal D}^{-}(j)$. Also, there exist principal
continuos representations on the Hilbert space
\be
{\cal C}_{\alpha}(\varsigma)=\left\{\left|\varsigma ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle : \hspace{5mm} \varsigma \in I\!\!R^+ ; \hspace{5mm}  0\leq\alpha<1; \hspace{5mm} m_{\alpha}=\alpha+n ,\hspace{5mm} n\in Z \right\}
\ee
where
\be
{\bf J}^2 \left|\varsigma ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle=\left(\varsigma^2+\frac{1}{4}\right)
\left|\varsigma ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle ,  \hspace{25mm} 
J_3 \left|\varsigma ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle =m_{\alpha} \left|\varsigma ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle .
\ee
Furtheremore, the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$ has complementary continuos representations, which are realized in the Hilbert space as 
\bea
&&{\cal C}_{\alpha}(\tau)=\{\left|\tau ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle : \hspace{5mm} 
-\frac{1}{2}<\tau<-\alpha , \hspace{3mm} 0\leq\alpha<\frac{1}{2}  
\nonumber \\
&&\hspace{30mm} \mbox{or} \hspace{2mm} -\frac{1}{2}<\tau<\alpha-1 , \hspace{3mm} \frac{1}{2}<\alpha<1 ;
\hspace{5mm} m_{\alpha}=\alpha+n , \hspace{5mm} n\in Z \}
\eea
where
\be
{\bf J}^2 \left|\tau ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle=-\tau\left(\tau+1\right)
\left|\tau ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle ,  \hspace{25mm} 
J_3 \left|\tau ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle =m_{\alpha} \left|\tau ,\alpha;m_{\alpha} \right\rangle .
\ee
It is clear that the eigenvalues of the Casimir operator ${\bf J}^2$
corresponding to the principal and complementary continuos representations
are the same if we choose $\tau=-\frac{1}{2}+i\varsigma$ .
It is well known that the decomposition of the tensor product of positive
(or negative) discrete representations of the Lie algebra $su(1,1)$ is
\be
{\cal D}^{\pm}(j)\otimes {\cal D}^{\pm}(s)\cong
\bigoplus_{l\geq j+s }{\cal D}^{\pm}(l)\,. \label{DISCRET}
\ee
And, for $j\geq s$ 
the decomposition of the discrete representations become
\bea
&&{\cal D}^{+}(s)\otimes {\cal D}^-(j)\cong
{\int_0^{\oplus}}^\infty {\cal C}_{s-j+\mu}(\varsigma) d\varsigma
\hspace{25mm} j-s \leq \frac{1}{2} \hspace{4mm} \mbox{and} \hspace{4mm}
j+s\geq \frac{1}{2} \nonumber  \\
&&{\cal D}^{+}(s)\otimes {\cal D}^-(j)\cong
{\int_0^{\oplus}}^\infty {\cal C}_{s-j+\mu}(\varsigma) d\varsigma
\oplus {\cal C}_{s-j+\mu}(\tau=-j-s)
\hspace{17mm} j+s<\frac{1}{2} \nonumber \\
&&{\cal D}^{+}(s)\otimes {\cal D}^-(j)\cong
{\int_0^{\oplus}}^\infty {\cal C}_{s-j+\mu}(\varsigma) d\varsigma
\oplus\bigoplus_{\frac{1}{2}<l\leq j-s}{\cal D}^-(l)
\hspace{28mm} j-s>\frac{1}{2}\, ,   \label{CONTIN}
\eea
where $j-s\leq\mu<j-s+1$, and all the direct sums  are in integer steps.
Suppose the kets $\left| j,m_j \right\rangle$ span the two principal
discrete representation spaces of the operator ${\bf J}$, as given in
(\ref{JLS}) as (\ref{REPRE}). According to the decomposition (\ref{DISCRET}) 
and (\ref{CONTIN}), and since $m_{l}=m_{j}\pm\frac{1}{2}$,
the allowed discrete representations of ${\bf L}^2$ with the
spectrum ${\bf L}^2=-(j+m-\frac{1}{2})(j+m-\frac{3}{2})$ is in 
${\cal D}^{\pm}(l=j+m-\frac{1}{2})$. Note that $m\geq 0$ for both 
possitive and negative principal
discrete representations in (\ref{DISCRET}), and 
$1-j<m\leq -1$ for the negative principal
discrete representation in the last equation of (\ref{CONTIN}). 
If we denote the eigenvalues of $D$ by $\lambda_{j,m}$, 
using Eqs. (\ref{XXXX}),  
the spectrum of the squared Dirac operator is then calculated as
\be
\lambda_{j,m}^2=
\left(j+m-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\left[1
+\frac{1-\left(j+m-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}
{N(N-2)}\right]+m(2j+m-1)
\left[\frac{4\left(j+m-1\right)^2-1}
{2N(N-2)}-1\right]\, ,   
\label{SPECTR}
\ee
where the operators ${\bf J}^2$  and ${\bf L}^2$ are restricted over their common
eigenstates. According to the above equation the spectrum of the Dirac operator on noncommutative $AdS_2$ depends on both quantum numbers $j$ and $m$, whereas in the commutative 
case (hyperbolic plane) the spectrum depends  only on $j$. It is interesting to
see whether the commutative spectrum can be reobtained from the above 
noncommutative expression. In the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, observe that
$\lambda_{j,m}^2\rightarrow \left(j-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2$ which depends
only on the quantum number $j$, and this is consistent with the fact
that the spectrum of the Dirac operator on $AdS_2$ is
degenerate. Hence, noncommutativity has lifted the degeneracy. Finally note that 
for a finite $N$, the state $j=N-\frac{1}{2}$ and $m=0$ is a zeromode, and 
if we require the spectrum $\lambda_{j,m}$ to be real, we find
that $j+m\leq N-\frac{1}{2}$.
