\begin{quote}
The 7--particle form factors of the fundamental spin field of the O(3) 
nonlinear $\sigma$--model are constructed. We calculate the corresponding
contribution to the spin--spin correlation function, and compare 
with predictions from the spectral density scaling hypothesis. 
The resulting approximation to the spin--spin correlation function 
agrees well with that computed in renormalized (asymptotically free) 
perturbation theory in the expected energy range. 
Further we observe simple lower and upper bounds for the sum of the 
absolute square of the form factors which may be of use for 
analytic estimates.
