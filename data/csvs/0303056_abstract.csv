New algebraic approach to analytical calculations of
$D$-dimensional integrals for
multi-loop Feynman diagrams is proposed.
We show that the known analytical methods of evaluation of
multi-loop Feynman integrals,
such as integration by parts and star-triangle
relation methods, can be drastically simplified by
using this algebraic approach.
To demonstrate the
advantages of the algebraic method of analytical evaluation of
multi-loop Feynman diagrams, we calculate ladder diagrams for the massless $\phi^3$
theory.
Using our algebraic approach we show that the problem of evaluation
of special classes of
Feynman diagrams reduces to the calculation of the Green functions
for specific quantum mechanical problems.
In particular, the integrals for ladder massless diagrams in the $\phi^3$
scalar field theory are given by the Green function for the
conformal quantum mechanics.
