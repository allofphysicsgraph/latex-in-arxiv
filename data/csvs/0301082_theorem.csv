(main theorem of the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory) Let ($\mathcal{A,H}%
,\Omega$) denote a weakly closed (von Neumann) operator algebra $\mathcal{A}$
acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H,}$ with $\Omega\in\mathcal{H}$ a vector
on which $\mathcal{A}$ acts in a cyclic and separating manner. Then there
exists an antilinear closed involutive operator $S$ which has the dense
subspace $\mathcal{A}\Omega$ in its domain such that
\begin{align}
SA\Omega &  =A^{\ast}\Omega,\,A\in\mathcal{A}\\
S  &  =J\Delta^{\frac{1}{2}},\,J\Delta=\Delta^{-1}J\nonumber
\end{align}
The polar decomposition of $S$ leads to an antiunitary $J$ and a positive
$\Delta$ which in turn defines the unitary modular group $\Delta^{it}.$ Their
significance results from their adjoint action on the algebra
\begin{align}
J\mathcal{A}J  &  =\mathcal{A}^{\prime}\\
\sigma_{t}(A)  &  \equiv\Delta^{it}A\Delta^{-it}\in\mathcal{A}\nonumber
\end{align}
The modular automorphism $\sigma_{t}$ fulfills the following KMS property
(with $\beta=-1,$ see below$)$%
\begin{equation}
\omega(\sigma_{t}(A)B)=\omega(B\sigma_{t-i}(A)B),\,\omega(\cdot)\equiv\left(
\Omega,\cdot\Omega\right)
\end{equation}
and depends only on the state $\omega$ (and not on its implementing vector
$\Omega).$
