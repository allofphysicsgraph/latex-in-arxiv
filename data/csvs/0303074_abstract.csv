We study ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $U(N)$ gauge theory coupled to 
an adjoint scalar superfiled with a cubic superpotential
containing a multi trace term. We show that the field theory 
results can be reproduced from a matrix model which its 
potential is given in terms of a linearized potential obtained 
from the gauge theory superpotential by adding some auxiliary 
nondynamical field. Once we get the effective action from this 
matrix model we could integrate out the auxiliary field getting 
the correct field theory results.
