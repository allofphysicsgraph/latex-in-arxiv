A partial wave analysis using the basis of the total angular momentum
operator $J_{3}$ is carried out for the first order Born amplitude of a Dirac
particle in an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) potential. It is demonstrated that the
s-partial wave contributes to the scattering amplitude in contrast to the case
with scalar non-relativistic particles. We suggest that this explains the
fact that the first order Born amplitude of a Dirac particle coincides with
the exact amplitude expanded to the same order, where it does not for a
scalar particle. An interesting algebra involving the Dirac velocity operator and
the angular observables is discovered and its consequences are exploited.
