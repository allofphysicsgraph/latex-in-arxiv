Smooth-throat wormholes are treated on as possessing quantum
fluctuation energy with scalar massive field as its source. Heat
kernel coefficients of the Laplace operator are calculated  in
background of the arbitrary-profile throat wormhole with the help
of the zeta-function approach. Two specific profile are
considered. Some arguments are given that the wormholes may exist.
It serves as a solution of semiclassical Einstein equations in the
range of specific values of length and certain radius of
wormhole's throat and constant of non-minimal connection.
