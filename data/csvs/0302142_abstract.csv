The heat kernel method is extended to the case of finite temperature. Special emphasis
is given to the study of gauge theories. Due to the
compactness of space in the Euclidean time direction (inverse temperature) the field
strength cannot completely characterize the gauge fields. This is just a
manifestation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The field strength has to be supplemented
by the Polyakov loop. Only if the latter is taken into account one obtains gauge
covariant results for the generalized Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the heat kernel 
expansion.
