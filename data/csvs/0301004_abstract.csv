We derive recurrence relations between phase space expressions in
different dimensions by confining some of the coordinates to tori
or spheres of radius $R$ and taking the limit as $R \rightarrow \infty$.
These relations take the form of mass integrals, associated with extraneous
momenta (relative to the lower dimension), and produce the result in the 
higher dimension.
