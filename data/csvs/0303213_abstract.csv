Recently, gauged supergravities in three dimensions with Yang-Mills
and Chern-Simons type interactions have been constructed. In this
article, we demonstrate that any gauging of Yang-Mills type with
semisimple gauge group ${\rm G}_0$, possibly including extra couplings
to massive Chern-Simons vectors, is equivalent on-shell to a pure
Chern-Simons type gauging with non-semisimple gauge group ${\rm
G}_0\ltimes {\rm T}\subset {\rm G}$, where ${\rm T}$ is a certain
translation group, and where ${\rm G}$ is the maximal global symmetry
group of the ungauged theory. We discuss several examples.
