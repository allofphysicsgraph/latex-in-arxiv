\item
The generator of $Z_N$ acts on the directions $X^3+ i X^8, X^4 + i
X^5$ in the standard way.  In the deconstruction setup one needs to
move into the Higgs branch, so our branes will need to be   in the
regular representation of $Z_N$.
\item
The generator of $Z_r$ acts   on the directions $X^4+ i X^5, X^6 + i
X^7$. The CP assignments for this generator are as before
(section 3.1) only taken with multiplicity of $k N$, to account
for all images with respect to the $Z_N$ orbifold action, and to
generate a nonabelian $SU(k)$ gauge group in four dimensions.
