In conventional gauge theory, a charged point particle is described by
a representation of the gauge group. If we propagate the particle
along some path, the parallel transport of the gauge connection acts
on this representation. The Lagrangian density of the gauge field
depends on the curvature of the connection which can be calculated
from the holonomy around (infinitesimal) loops. For Abelian symmetry
groups, say $G=\U(1)$, there exists a generalization, known as
$p$-form electrodynamics, in which $(p-1)$-dimensional charged objects
can be propagated along $p$-surfaces and in which the Lagrangian
depends on a generalized curvature associated with (infinitesimal)
closed $p$-surfaces. In this article, we use Lie $2$-groups and ideas
from higher category theory in order to formulate a discrete gauge
theory which generalizes these models at the level $p=2$ to possibly
non-Abelian symmetry groups. An important feature of our model is that
it involves both parallel transports along paths and generalized
transports along surfaces with a non-trivial interplay of these two
types of variables. Our main result is the geometric picture, namely
the assignment of non-Abelian quantities to geometrical objects in a
coordinate free way. We construct the precise assignment of variables
to the curves and surfaces, the generalized local symmetries and gauge
invariant actions and we clarify which structures can be non-Abelian
and which others are always Abelian. A discrete version of connections
on non-Abelian gerbes is a special case of our construction. Even
though the motivation sketched so far suggests applications mainly in
string theory, the model presented here is also related to spin foam
models of quantum gravity and may in addition provide some insight
into the role of centre monopoles and vortices in lattice QCD.
