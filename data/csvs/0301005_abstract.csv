We give an elementary introduction to the structure of supergravity
theories. This leads to a table with an overview of supergravity and
supersymmetry theories in dimensions 4 to 11. The basic steps in
constructing supergravity theories are considered: determination of the
underlying algebra, the multiplets, the actions, and solutions. Finally,
an overview is given of the geometries that result from the scalars of
supergravity theories.

\bigskip
\it Key words: Supergravity, gauge theories, superalgebras, K{\""a}hler
geometry, quaternionic geometry
