We describe the supergravity solutions dual to D6-branes with both time-dependent
and time-independent $B$-fields. These backgrounds generalize the
Taub-NUT metric in two key ways: they have asymmetric warp factors and
background fluxes. In the time-dependent case,
the warping takes a novel form. Kaluza-Klein reduction
in these backgrounds is unusual, and we explore some of the new
features. In particular, we describe how a localized
gauge-field emerges with an analogue of the open string metric and
coupling. We also describe a gravitational analogue of the
Seiberg-Witten map. This provides
a framework in supergravity both for
studying non-commutative gauge theories, and for constructing novel
warped backgrounds.
