In this paper we show that the entropy of cosmological horizon in
4-dimensional Topological Kerr-Newman-de Sitter  spaces can be
described by the Cardy-Verlinde formula, which is supposed to be
an entropy formula of conformal field theory in any dimension.
Furthermore, we find that the entropy of black hole horizon can
also be rewritten in terms of the Cardy-Verlinde formula for these
black holes in de Sitter spaces, if we use the definition due to
Abbott and Deser for conserved charges in asymptotically de Sitter
spaces. Such result presume a well-defined dS/CFT correspondence,
which has not yet attained the credibility of its AdS analogue.
