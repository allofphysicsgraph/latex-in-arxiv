\begin{abstract}
We study different Penrose limits of supergravity solution of NS5-brane in the
presence of RR field. Although in the case of NS5-brane we get a 
4-dimensional plane wave, in the case with RR field we will get two
different plane waves; a 4-dimensional and a 3-dimensional one. These
plane wave solutions are the backgrounds that a particular string solution 
feels at
one loop approximation. Using the one loop correction one can identify a 
particular subsector of LST/deformed LST which is dual to type II string
theories on these plane waves.
