\begin{abstract}
  A general method of the BRST--anti-BRST symmetric conversion of
  second-class constraints is presented.  It yields a pair of
  commuting and nilpotent BRST-type charges that can be naturally
  regarded as BRST and anti-BRST ones.  Interchanging the BRST and
  anti-BRST generators corresponds to a symmetry between the original
  second-class constraints and the conversion variables, which
  enter the formalism on equal footing.

\section{Introduction}
For first-class constraints, the well-known BFV--BRST quantization
method provides an adequate description of general constrained systems
at the classical and quantum levels~\cite{BFV}.  But for second-class
systems, a proper counterpart of the BFV--BRST method is not yet
known.  Most of the well-established approaches to second-class
systems are based on the construction of an effective first-class
system that is equivalent to the original second-class
system~\cite{FSh,BF,BF87, Split,BMgauge}.  Among these methods, the
most developed one is the so-called \textit{conversion
  method}~\cite{FSh,BF,BF87,BT,BGL}.  In this approach, one introduces
additional variables $\phi$, called \textit{conversion variables}, and
extends second-class constraints by $\phi$-dependent terms such that
the extended constraints become first-class.

The conversion method has proved a powerful tool for description and
quantization of second-class systems.  But the general conversion is
too ambiguous, and it seems natural to reduce this ambiguity by
imposing additional conditions on the conversion procedure.  A
well-known restriction consists in requiring the effective gauge
algebra to be of a fixed rank; a common choice is to take a $0$-rank
(Abelian) effective gauge algebra.  This \textit{Abelian} conversion
is well studied; in particular, the existence theorem and a
constructive procedure are known for the effective
constraints~\cite{BT}.

In this paper, we take another route and reduce the ambiguity by
requiring the conversion procedure to respect extra symmetries.
Namely, we treat the original second-class constraints and conversion
variables on equal footing.  Technically, this implies that the
conversion variables appear as constraints $\bar\theta^\alpha$ dual to
the original second-class constraints $\theta_\alpha$.  We then
proceed with the conversion keeping the symmetry between
$\theta_\alpha$ and $\bar\theta^\alpha$ explicit.


The conversion is carried out in the framework of the BFV--BRST
approach.  At the level of the effective gauge system (converted
system), the symmetry between $\theta^\alpha$ and $\bar\theta^\alpha$
results in the BRST--anti-BRST invariance.  The BRST and anti-BRST charges
are associated to the appropriately
extended original constraints $\theta_\alpha$ and the extended dual
constraints $\bar\theta^\alpha$ respectively.


The paper is organized as follows: in Sec.~\textbf{\ref{sec:basics}}, we
develop basics of our approach to conversion and show that the
resulting gauge system is naturally described by a pair of nilpotent
and commuting generators identified as the BRST and anti-BRST
generators.  In Sec.~\textbf{\ref{sec:QA}}, generating equations of the
BRST--anti-BRST symmetric conversion are reformulated as a certain
type of master equations with respect to the~\textit{quantum
  antibracket}~\cite{BMQA}.  A more restricted version of the
formalism is considered in Sec.~\textbf{\ref{sec:special}}.  In this more
special approach, generating operators satisfy stronger conditions.
These conditions are also shown to allow the existence of a conversion
procedure for arbitrary original constraints $\theta_\alpha$.  In
Sec.~\textbf{\ref{sec:Hamiltonian}}, we consider construction of a unitarizing
Hamiltonian in the BRST--anti-BRST symmetric formulation.



\section{Basics}\label{sec:basics}
Let a second-class constrained system be determined by constraints
$\theta^\alpha\,,\alpha=1,\ldots\,,2N$.  Their Dirac matrix is given
by
\begin{equation}
\ih  \Delta^0_{\alpha\beta}=[\theta_\al\theta_\beta,\theta_\beta]\,,
\end{equation}
and is assumed to be invertible. To each constraint $\theta^\alpha$ we
associate its dual $\bar\theta^\alpha$. We choose
$\varepsilon{(\bar\theta^\alpha)}=\varepsilon{(\theta_\alpha)}$ where $\varepsilon{(f)}$ denotes
Grassmann parity of $f$. Dual constraints plays a role of extra
degrees of freedom and therefore are defined on the appropriate
extension of the original phase space.  A basic example is provided by
taking $\bar\theta^\alpha=e_\beta^\alpha \phi^\beta$ where
$\phi^\alpha$ are conversion variables and $e^\alpha_\beta$ depend on
phase space variables only.

In what follows we prefer to work in terms of generating functions (operators)
and not in terms of constraints. To this end let us introduce ghost variables
${\mathcal C}^\alpha$ and $\bar{\mathcal P}_\alpha$ associated either to
constraints $\theta_\alpha$ or $\bar \theta^\alpha$. One assignees the 
following
Grassmann parities to the
ghost variables:
$$
\varepsilon{({\mathcal C}^\alpha)}=\varepsilon{(\bar{\mathcal P}_\alpha)}=\varepsilon{(\theta_\alpha)}+1=\varepsilon{(\bar\theta^\alpha)}+1\,, 
\qquad
\alpha=1,\ldots,2N\,.
$$
We also choose standard commutation relations and ghost number gradings
for variables ${\mathcal C}^\alpha$ and $\bar{\mathcal P}_\alpha$
$$
[{\mathcal C}^\alpha\bar{\mathcal P}_\beta,\bar{\mathcal P}_\beta]=\ih \delta^\alpha_\beta\,,\qquad
{\rm gh}({\mathcal C}^\alpha)=1\,, \quad {\rm gh}(\bar{\mathcal P}_\alpha)= -1\,.
$$
The ghost number operator is then assumed to have the following
form:
$$
G=\half({\mathcal C}^\alpha\bar{\mathcal P}_\alpha(-1)^{\varepsilon_{\alpha}}-\bar{\mathcal P}_\alpha{\mathcal C}^\alpha)\,.
$$
Generating operators encoding constraints $\theta_\alpha$
and $\bar\theta^\alpha$ are denoted by $\mathbf{\Theta}$ and $\bar\mathbf{\Theta}$
respectively; their expansions with respect to ghost variables start as
$$
\mathbf{\Theta}={\mathcal C}^\alpha \theta_\alpha+\ldots\,,\qquad
\bar\mathbf{\Theta}=\bar\theta^\alpha \bar{\mathcal P}_\alpha (-1)^{\varepsilon_{\alpha}}+\ldots\,,
$$
and are subjected to the following ghost number prescriptions:
\begin{equation}
  [G,\mathbf{\Theta}]=\ih \mathbf{\Theta}\,,\qquad
  [G,\bar\mathbf{\Theta}]=-\ih\bar\mathbf{\Theta}\,.
\end{equation}


We are interested in constructing first-class constrained (gauge) system
equivalent to the original second-class one and entering constraints $\theta$
and $\bar\theta$ in a symmetric way. To this end we are looking for a pair
of generators $\Omega$ and $\bar\Omega$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
\label{eq:nilpotency}
[\Omega,\Omega]=0\,,\qquad
[\bar\Omega\bar\Omega,\bar\Omega]=0\,,\\
[\Omega,\bar\Omega]=0\,.
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
$\Omega$ and $\bar\Omega$ are to be understood as appropriate
extensions of the original generating operators $\mathbf{\Theta}$ and
$\bar\mathbf{\Theta}$ respectively.

It is useful to introduce the following condensed notations:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
 \mathbf{\Theta}^{a}&\,,\quad a=1,2\, \qquad
 \mathbf{\Theta}^1=\mathbf{\Theta}\,,\quad
\mathbf{\Theta}^2=\bar\mathbf{\Theta}\,,\\
 {\Omega^{a}}&\,,\quad a=1,2\, \qquad
 {\Omega^1}={\Omega}\,,\quad 
{\Omega^2}={\bar\Omega}\,.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The ghost number assignments then take the form
\begin{equation}
[G,\mathbf{\Theta}^a]=\ih g^a_b \mathbf{\Theta}^b \,,
\qquad
[G,{\Omega^a]}=
\ih g^a_b {\Omega^b}\,,\label{eq:ghost}
\end{equation}
where the only nonvanishing components of $g^a_b$ are
$g^1_1=1$ and $g^2_2=-1$. We also introduce operator $\Delta^{ab}$
defined by
$$
2\ih\Delta^{ab}=[\mathbf{\Theta}^a,\mathbf{\Theta}^b]\,.
$$
In terms of new notations conditions \eqref{eq:nilpotency}
read as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nilpotency-short}
