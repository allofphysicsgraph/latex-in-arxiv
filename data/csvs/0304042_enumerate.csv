\item 
In any theoretical framework that requires charge to be quantized,
there will exist magnetic monopoles.
\item 
In any fully unified theory, for every gauge field there will exist
electric and magnetic sources with the minimum relative Dirac quantum
$n=1$ (more precisely, the lattice of electric and magnetic charges is
maximal).
