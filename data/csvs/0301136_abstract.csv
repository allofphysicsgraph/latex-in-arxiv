We describe an expedient way to derive the CIV-DV prepotential
 in power series expansion in $S_i$. This is
based on integrations of equations for its derivatives
$\partial {\cal F}/\partial T_m$ with respect to additional
(Whitham) moduli $T_m$.
For illustrative purposes, we calculate explicitly the
leading terms of the expansion and explicitly check
some components of
the WDVV equations to the leading order.
Extension to any higher order is simple and algorithmic.
