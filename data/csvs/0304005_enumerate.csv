\item  The star product in Witten's string field theory is mapped to the
Moyal star product \cite{B1} after an appropriate change of variables. The
string field $A\left( \bar{x},x_{e}.p_{e}\right) $ in the new basis is a
function of the string midpoint $\bar{x}$ and the phase space $\left(
x_{e},p_{e}\right) $ of even string modes $e=2,4,6,\cdots $. While Witten's
star product, written in terms of Neumann coefficients \cite{GJ}, is very
complicated to manipulate in computations, the Moyal star product in MSFT,
which is diagonal in mode space labelled by $e$, is the simplest form of the
star product that occurs in standard noncommutative geometry. This feature
vastly simplifies the structure of string field theory and is very helpful
in explicit computations.

\item  The change of variables introduces a set of simple but infinite
matrices $T_{eo},R_{oe},v_{o},w_{e},$ labelled by $e=2,4,6,\cdots ,$ and $%
o=1,3,5,\cdots ,$ which contain basic information about even $\left(
e\right) $ and odd $\left( o\right) $ string modes. These matrices obey a
matrix algebra that has an associativity anomaly, which in turn feeds into
an associativity anomaly among string fields \cite{BM1}. The origin of the
anomaly is the infinite number of string modes that cause the appearance of
ambiguous terms of the form $\infty /\infty .$ In order to resolve this
problem, we proposed \cite{BM1, BM2} a regularization by truncating the
number of the oscillators to finite $2N$, and defined a deformed set of
finite matrices $T,R,v,w$ as functions of the oscillator frequencies $\kappa
_{e},\kappa _{o}$ of the $2N$ modes. After such regulation, the
associativity is restored and all manipulations become well-defined. The
original open string field theory is restored by taking the original
frequencies, $\kappa _{e}=e,$ $\kappa _{o}=o,$ and the large $N$ limit at
the end of the computation. Through explicit computation of specific
examples, it has been shown that this regulation procedure correctly
reproduces results computed independently in conformal string theory.

\item  In the regularized basis, we computed the Neumann coefficients
analytically by using only the Moyal product. These coefficients are not
needed for computations in MSFT, but they provide a check of MSFT relative
to the operator formulation given in \cite{GJ}. We have shown that the
Neumann coefficients derived in the regularized MSFT framework satisfy the
Gross-Jevicki nonlinear relations, and thus provide a generalization of
Neumann coefficients for any set of frequencies $\kappa _{e},\kappa _{o}$
and any $N.$ This provided the first consistency check of MSFT \cite{BM2}.
Furthermore, we found that the Neumann coefficients for any $n$-point vertex
are all simple functions of a single matrix $t_{eo}=\kappa
_{e}^{1/2}T_{eo}\kappa _{o}^{-1/2}.$ Diagonalizing the matrix $t$
diagonalizes all the Neumann coefficients simultaneously for all $n$-point
vertices \cite{BM2}. At large $N$ our diagonal form agrees with the one
given in \cite{spectro}\cite{DLMZ}, and explains in particular why there is
Neumann spectroscopy for the 3-point vertex \cite{spectro}, and generalizes
it to any $n$-point vertex \cite{BM2}.

\item  One of the nice features of MSFT is that the star product is diagonal
in mode space (i.e. independent and same for each mode). The only cost for
this simplification is that the kinetic term given by the Virasoro operator $%
L_{0}$ becomes off-diagonal in mode space $\left( x_{e},p_{e}\right) $ \cite
{BM2}. However, this has not hindered explicit computations. In particular,
we have derived the Feynman rules, including the propagator $\left(
L_{0}-1\right) ^{-1},$ and shown that we can evaluate efficiently and
explicitly the Feynman graphs in open string field theory \cite{BKM1}.

\item  The off-diagonal part of the kinetic term depends on a specific
combination of momentum modes, namely $\hat{p}=\left( 1+\bar{w}w\right)
^{-1/2}\sum_{e}w_{e}p_{e}$ which we refer to as the \textquotedblleft
anomalous midpoint mode'' \cite{BM1}\cite{B2}. This mode appears in the
kinetic operator in the form $L_{0}=\gamma +\cdots ,$ with $\gamma \sim \hat{%
p}^{2}$, while the remaining part of the kinetic term is diagonal in mode
space. We named the term $\gamma $ the \textquotedblleft midpoint
correction'' . We found that if it were not for this midpoint correction, the
rest of the kinetic plus interaction terms would define a theory, equivalent
to an infinite matrix theory, that is vastly simpler and completely solvable 
\cite{BKM2}. However we determined that the $\gamma $ term is essential for
the correct definition of string field theory. Thus we have isolated the
hard part of string field theory in the form of the quadratic
\textquotedblleft midpoint correction'' term $\gamma .$ We have shown that
all classical solutions, including the true vacuum, of the interacting
string theory, are obtained analytically by first solving the nonlinear
equation explicitly by ignoring $\gamma ,$ and then including the effect of $%
\gamma $ in a closed formal expression that can be evaluated to any order in
a perturbative expansion in powers of $\gamma $ \cite{BKM2}.

\item  In Fock space we choose $n$ coherent states for $\langle \Psi_r|,$ 
$r=1,2,\cdots n,$ labelled by parameters $\mu ^{*\left( r\right) }$. The
left hand side of (\ref{e_basic_corresp}) can be computed in the operator
formalism. The result takes the form of an exponential that contains a
quadratic form in the parameters of the coherent states $\mu ^{\left(
r\right) }$. The Neumann coefficients that define $|V_{n}\rangle $ appear as
the coefficients in the quadratic form. We treat the Neumann coefficients as
unknown matrices.

\item  We calculate 
$\hat{A}_r(\xi _{0},\xi )=
\langle \xi _{0},\xi |\tilde{\Psi}_r\rangle $ 
which gives the Moyal image of the coherent states in the form of  monoids, 
with the $\lambda^{(r)}$ related to the parameters $\mu ^{*\left(r\right) }$ 
of the coherent state.

\item  We compute the right hand side of (\ref{e_basic_corresp}) by using
the result in Eqs.(\ref{eq:star_a}--\ref{eq:star}). 
As in item (1) this is also an exponential
containing a quadratic form in the coherent state parameters $\mu ^{*\left(
r\right) }$, but with the coefficients determined by the monoid algebra
given above.

\item  We compare the coefficients of the parameters in both sides and thus
determine the Neumann coefficients completely. 
They turn out to be simple functions of a single matrix 
$t_{eo}=\kappa _{e}^{1/2}T_{eo}\kappa_{o}^{-1/2}.$
