In this letter we propose to obtain a lower bound for the mass scale of space-time non-commutativity,
considering the photon--neutrino interaction. 
We evaluate a non-commutative ``$\star$--dipole moment'' and ``$\star$--charge
radius''.
{}From the ``$\star$--dipole moment'' 
we obtain the bound $\Lambda_{\rm NC}\;\geq M^*=2\,\pi\,(\sqrt 2
G_F)^{-1/2}{\simeq}\;1.5$ TeV by comparing it with the standard model contribution
assuming it to be correct. 
This is a generic estimate, whereas details depend on the neutrino mass matrix.
Next we find that the ``$\star$--charge radius'' depends on the non-commutativity between space and time as 
$\langle r^2_{\nu}\rangle^2_{\rm NC}=3\sum_{i=1}^3 ({\theta}^{0i})^2$, and is 
$\stackrel{<}{\sim} 0.3 \times 10^{-33}\; {\rm cm}^2$ at a scale of non-commutativity of $\Lambda_{\rm NC}
\geq 1.5\;\rm TeV$.
This number is smaller than the bounds obtained from astrophysics.
