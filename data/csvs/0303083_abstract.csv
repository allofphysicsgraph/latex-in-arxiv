0,"\begin{abstract}We present  a conformal field theory
 calculation of four-point and three-point correlation
functions  for the bosonic  twist fields  arising at the
intersections of  D-branes    wrapping  (supersymmetric) homology
cycles of Type II orientifold compactifications. Both the quantum
contribution from local excitations at the intersections and the
world-sheet disk instanton corrections are computed.  As a
consequence we obtain the complete  expression for the Yukawa
couplings  of chiral fermions with the Higgs fields. The
four-point correlation functions in turn lead to the determination
of the four-point couplings in the effective theory, and may be of
phenomenological interest.
