We incorporate running parameters and anomalous dimensions into the
framework of the exact renormalization group.  We modify the exact
renormalization group differential equations for a real scalar field
theory, using the anomalous dimensions of the squared mass and the
scalar field.  Following a previous paper in which an integral
equation approach to the exact renormalization group was introduced,
we reformulate the modified differential equations as integral
equations that define the continuum limit directly in terms of a
running squared mass and self-coupling constant.  Universality of the
continuum limit under an arbitrary change of the momentum cutoff
function is discussed using the modified exact renormalization group
equations.
