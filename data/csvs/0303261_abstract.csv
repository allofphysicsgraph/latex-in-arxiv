The critical effective potential is the nonperturbative part of the effective action
at a phase transition. It equals the scale invariant effective average potential and
can be calculated from the renormalization group flow of the effective average action.
In some cases this requires only the solution of an ordinary differential equation 
without actually simulating the renormalization group flow. Here the Ising model is 
examined beyond leading order and with full field dependent effective potential.
