$\hat{X}_{\alpha_1\beta_1}^{k_1}\dots\hat{X}_{\alpha_n\beta_n}^{k_n}$, 
with $k_i\geq 0$, form a basis of ${\cal U}(\cG)$.

1,"\begin{thm} Let 
\[{\cal I}_{\cas}=\prod_{\alpha=1}^N(\hat{C}_\alpha-\hbar^\alpha\cas_\alpha)
{\cal U}(\cG)\] 
be the ideal generated by the Casimir operators $\hat{C}_\alpha$. 
The quotient $\cL_{\cas}(\cG)={\cal U}(\cG)/{\cal I}_{\cas}$ is a Lie algebra (roughly speaking,
this quotient means that we replace $\hat{C}_\alpha$ by the complex c-number
$C_\alpha\equiv\hbar^\alpha\cas_\alpha$ whenever it appears in the commutators of elements of
${\cal U}(\cG)$). We shall refer to $\cL_{\cas}(\cG)$ as a $c$-tensor operator algebra.

2,"\begin{thm}\label{Burnside}(Burnside) When $\cas_\alpha, \alpha=1,\dots,N$ coincide with the
eigenvalues of $\hat{C}_\alpha$ in a $d_{\cas}$-dimensional irrep $D_{\cas}$ of
$G$, there exists an ideal $\chi\subset\cL_{\cas}(\cG)$ such that
$\cL_{\cas}(\cG)/\chi=sl(d_{\cas},\mathbb{C})$,
or $su(d_{\cas})$, by taking a compact real form of the complex Lie
algebra.

decomposes,

into factor algebras $\cL_{\cas}({\cal

irreducible representations  of $G$ of dimension $d_{\cas}$.

${\cal 
I}_{\alpha_1\beta_1\alpha_2\beta_2}=x_{\alpha_1\beta_1\alpha_2\beta_2}C^\infty(\cG^*)$
represent ideals of the algebra $C^\infty(\cG^*)$ of smooth functions $L$ on the coalgebra $\cG^*$, with 
Poisson-Lie bracket (\ref{poissonlie}), generated by polynomials like 
(\ref{reord}) in the coordinates $x_{\alpha\beta}$.  Then, the Poisson 
algebra (\ref{nPoisson}) is 
equivalent to the quotient $C^\infty(\cG^*)/{\cal 
I}_{\alpha_1\beta_1\alpha_2\beta_2}$.
