The interpretation of D-branes in terms of open strings has lead to much 
interest in boundary conditions of two-dimensional conformal field theories 
(CFTs). These studies have deepened our understanding of CFT and allowed
us to develop new computational tools. The construction of CFT correlators 
based on combining tools from topological field theory and non-commutative
algebra in tensor categories, which we summarize in this contribution,
allows e.g.\ to discuss, apart from boundary conditions, also 
defect lines and disorder fields.
