We study the dynamical behavior of the dilaton in the background
of three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space which is  inspired from
the low-energy string effective action. The Kerr-de Sitter space
describes the gravitational background of a point particle whose
mass and spin are given by $1-M$ and $J$ and  its curvature radius
is given by $\ell$. In order to study the  propagation of metric,
dilaton, and Kalb-Ramond two-form, we perform the perturbation
analysis in the southern diamond of  Kerr-de Sitter space
including a conical singularity. It reveals a mixing between the
dilaton and other unphysical  fields.  Introducing a gauge-fixing,
we  can disentangle this mixing completely and obtain one
decoupled dilaton equation. However it turns out to be a tachyon
with $m^2=-8/\ell^2$. We compute the absorption cross section for
the dilatonic tachyon  to extract information on the cosmological
horizon of Kerr-de Sitter space. It is found that there is no
absorption of the dilatonic tachyon in the presence of the
cosmological horizon of Kerr-de Sitter space.
