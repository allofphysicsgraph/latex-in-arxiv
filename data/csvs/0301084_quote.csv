Returning to the old problems in ordinary QED,by an appropriate
extension of the dimensional regularization method in
noncommutative space we try to provide a quite coherent look into
NCQED.The renormalisation of theories, the $\beta$ function,the
vacuum polarisation of photon,the general structure of vertex
fermion-photon ,the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of fermions
and the validity of Ward identity at the one-loop level are
reinvestigated.
