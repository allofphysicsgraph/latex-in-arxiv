We examine the possibility of rolling tachyon to play the dual roll of inflaton at early epochs 
and dark matter at late times. We argue that enough inflation can be generated with the rolling tachyon either by 
invoking the large number of branes or brane world assisted inflation. However, reheating is problematic in this model.
