The recurrence relation becomes much more interesting for the three-body case,
\begin{equation}
 4\pi^2\rho^{2\ell}_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2+m_3}=\int\!\!\!\int\!\!\!\int\!  
 d\mu_1\,d\mu_2\,d\mu_3\,\delta(\mu_1+\mu_2+\mu_3)
 \rho^{2\ell-1}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu_1}+m_{2\mu_2}+m_{3\mu_3}}
\end{equation}
upon recalling that even and odd dimensional phase space behave rather 
differently: odd $D$ leads to a Laurent series in the masses, while even $D$ 
generally leads to elliptic functions \cite{BDR,Alm,BBBB}; eq.(8) signifies 
that there exists an integral relation between elliptic functions and 
polynomials/poles. 
Moreover the nature of the integral displays {\em explicit} symmetry in the 
masses which is useful. Because of the $\delta$ function constraint and the 
fact that the $\mu$ run over positive and negative values, the rhs of (8) can 
be broken up into the sum of three terms:
$$ 4\pi^2\rho^{2\ell}_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2+m_3}=2\int_0\!\!\int_0
   d\mu_1\,d\mu_2 
  \rho^{2\ell-1}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu_1}+m_{2\mu_2}+m_{3\mu_1+\mu_2}}
 \,{\rm~+~2~cyclic~perms.}$$
We may quickly check the truth of relation (8) for the test case $\ell=2$
when all particles are massless, since that limit of phase space simply 
yields
$$\rho^{4}_{m_0\rightarrow 0+0+0} =
  \lim_{\ell\rightarrow 2}\frac{(4\pi)^{1-2\ell}[\Gamma(\ell-1)]^3
   m_0^{4\ell-6}}{2\Gamma(3\ell-3)\Gamma(2\ell-2)} =\frac{m_0^2}{256\pi^3}$$
for the lhs. On the other hand for the rhs, substituting the 3-D result 
\cite{Raj},
$$\rho^3_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2+m_3}=(m_0\!-\!m_1\!-\!m_2\!-\!m_3)
\theta(m_0\!-\!m_1\!-\!m_2\!-\!m_3)/16\pi m_0,$$
each of the three permutations produces the same answer and we obtain a perfect
check of the recurrence relation. However one learns something new in the 
massive case since a {\em new} symmetrical representation for 4-D phase space
emerges:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \rho^4_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2+m_3}\!\!\!&=&\!\frac{1}{32\pi^3 m_0}
 \int_0\!\int_0 d\mu_1 d\mu_2\,
 (m_0\!-\!m_{1\mu_1}\!-\!m_{2\mu_2}\!-\!m_{3(\mu_1+\mu_2)}) \nonumber\\
 & & + {\rm 2~other~perms}.
\end{eqnarray}
One expects the right hand integral to produce elliptic functions, but the 
main virtue of (9) is that we get a pleasingly symmetrical sum of them which 
in principle ought to match an earlier form \cite{DD}, albeit obtained in a 
different manner. Although we have not yet succeeded in establishing the 
precise relation with the Jacobian zeta function form, we have performed a
series of {\em successful} numerical checks of (9), using typical mass values.

The same thing happens for larger $N$. For instance in 4-body decay there
arise four permutations with three of the $\mu_i$ having the same sign, 
opposite to the last one, plus six permutations where two pairs of $\mu_i$
have the same sign and opposite to the other pair. This would provide an
elegant symmetrical way of evaluating 4-body decay without resorting to
Almgren's nonsymmetrical way \cite{Alm} of pairing two bodies together and 
then summing over their pairwise mass sums.

One may of course continue in this vein and discuss spaces with the topology
$M^{D-n}\otimes T^n$, but one learns very little new by this ruse because the 
process just yields a set of angles $\theta_j=y_j/R_j$ and a set of mode 
numbers $k_j$ which collectively lead to $m_{\bf k}^2=m^2+\sum_j(k_j/R_j)^2$.
There is little gain in taking the limit as each $R_j\rightarrow\infty$
separately because we only care for the final result where none of the
radii is finite.

\section{Relations between $D$ and $D-2$ phase space}

Next we shall suppose that w are dealing with the direct topology $M^{D-2}
\otimes S^2$ so that the two extra angular coordinates are confined to the
surface of a 2-sphere having radius $R$; thus $\vec{y} = R
(\sin\theta\cos\varphi,\sin\theta\sin\varphi,\cos\theta)$, whereas previously
$y$ was identified with the circumference $R\theta$ rather than the radius 
vector. In such a situation expand the fields in spherical harmonics,
\begin{equation}
 \Phi({\bf x},\hat{y})=\sum_{j,k}\phi_{jk}({\bf x})Y_{jk}(\theta,\varphi)/R,
\end{equation}
before considering the limit of large $R$. The chosen factors ensure that
the lower-dimensional field modes $\phi$ are properly normalized:
\begin{equation}
 S_{\rm free}\!=\!\frac{1}{2}\int\!\! d^D\!x[(\partial_x\Phi)^2\!-\!m^2\Phi^2]
 =\sum_{j,k}\!\frac{1}{2}\int\!\!d^{D-2}\!{\bf x}[(\partial_{\bf x}\phi_{jk}^*)
 (\partial_{\bf x}\phi_{jk})\!-\!m_{j}^2\phi_{jk}^*\phi_{jk}],
\end{equation}
where $m_{j}^2=m^2+j(j+1)/R^2$. [In eq. (11) it is really meant that
$d^Dx = d^{D-2}{\bf x}R^2d^2\Omega$ and $(\partial \Phi)^2 = g^{ab}
\partial_a\Phi\partial_b\Phi$.] Again we note that $\phi_{jk}=\phi_{j-k}^*$
so the complex modes are found by just summing over positive $k$ and
discarding the factor of 1/2.

The two-body recurrence relation can be verified in its entirety, since the
effective coupling of a zero-mode mass $m_0$ field 
$\Sigma =\sigma/\sqrt{4\pi}R$ to two others yields a uniform amplitude, 
independently of the angular momentum eigenvalues $j,k$ as we see from
\begin{equation}
 \int d^Dx\, \Phi_1\Phi_2\Sigma= \sum_{j,k}
     \int d^{D-2}{\bf x}\,\,\sigma\Phi_{1j\,k}\Phi_{2j\,-k}/\sqrt{4\pi}R.
\end{equation}
The $(2j\!+\!1)$ degeneracy in $k$ leads to
\begin{equation} 
\rho^D_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2}=\frac{1}{4\pi R^2}\sum_j(2j+1)
  \rho^{D-2}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1j}+m_{2j}};\qquad 
  m_{ij}^2=m_i^2+\left(\frac{j}{R}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
In the limit $(R,j)\rightarrow \infty$, with $\mu=j/R$, this reduces to the 
continuum prediction,
\begin{equation}
 \rho^D_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2}=\int_0 d\mu^2\,\,
 \rho^{D-2}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu}+m_{2\mu}}/4\pi,
\end{equation}
which is readily verified from the explicit result (6).

The three body case is altogether more fascinating. Here the effective 
interaction reduces to
\begin{eqnarray}
 \int d^Dx\, \Phi_1\Phi_2\Phi_3\Sigma&=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi}R^2}
  \sum_{j_1,k_1}\sum_{j_2,k_2}\sum_{j_3,k_3}\int d^{D-2}{\bf x}\,
  \sigma\Phi_{1j_1\,k_1}\Phi_{2j_2\,k_2}\Phi_{3j_3\,k_3}\cdot\nonumber \\
 & &\qquad\qquad\int d^2\Omega\,Y_{j_1k_1}Y_{j_2k_2}Y_{j_3k_3}.
\end{eqnarray}
To make progress, use the orthogonality property of spherical 
harmonics \cite{sphharm},
$$\int d^2\Omega\,Y_{j_1k_1}Y_{j_2k_2}Y_{j_3k_3}\!=\!
   \sqrt{\frac{(2j_1\!+\!1)(2j_2\!+\!1)(2j_3\!+\!1)}{4\pi}} 
   \left(\!\begin{array}{ccc} j_1\!&\!j_2\!&\!j_3\\0\!&\!0\!&\!0\end{array}
    \!\right)
 \left(\!\begin{array}{ccc} j_1\!&\!j_2\!&\!j_3\\k_1\!&\!k_2\!&\!k_3\end{array}
  \!\right).$$
This then specifies the magnitudes of the mode couplings. When evaluating
the sum over modes, apply the completeness relation of C-G coefficients,
$$\sum_{k_2,k_3}  
 \left(\!\begin{array}{ccc} j_1\!&\!j_2\!&\!j_3\\k_1\!&\!k_2\!&\!k_3\end{array}
 \!\right)
 \left(\!\begin{array}{ccc} j_4\!&\!j_2\!&\!j_3\\k_4\!&\!k_2\!&\!k_3\end{array}
 \!\right)
 =\frac{\delta_{j_1j_4}\delta_{k_1k_4}}{2j_1+1},$$
signifying
$$\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3} \left(\!
 \begin{array}{ccc}j_1\!&\!j_2\!&\!j_3\\k_1\!&\!k_2\!&\!k_3\end{array}\!\right)^2
 =\sum_{k_1}\frac{1}{2j_1+1} = 1. $$
Therefore the summation over modes produces the discrete recurrence relation,
\begin{equation}
\rho^D_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2+m_3}\!=\!\!\!\!\sum_{j_1,j_2,j_3}\!\!\!
 \frac{(2j_1\!+\!1)(2j_2\!+\!1)(2j_3\!+\!1)}{(4\pi R^2)^2}\left(\!\!
 \begin{array}{ccc}j_1\!&\!j_2\!&\!j_3\\ 0\!&\!0\!&\!0\end{array}\!\!\right)^2
 \!\!\rho^{D-2}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1j_1}\!+m_{2j_2}\!+m_{3j_3}}
\end{equation}
whose continuum limit is of interest. To take $R\rightarrow\infty$, first note
that Wigner's 3-j symbol \cite{sphharm}
$$\hspace{-2in}\left(\!\!
 \begin{array}{ccc}j_1\!&\!j_2\!&\!j_3\\ 0\!&\!0\!&\!0\end{array}\!\!\right)
 \equiv (-1)^{-(j_1+j_2+j_3)/2}\times$$
$$\qquad\qquad\qquad\frac{ (\frac{j_1+j_2+j_3}{2})! \sqrt{(-j_1+j_2+j_3)!
   (j_1-j_2+j_3)!(j_1+j_2-j_3)!}} {\sqrt{(1+j_1+j_2+j_3)!}
 (\frac{-j_1+j_2+j_3}{2})!(\frac{j_1-j_2+j_3}{2})!(\frac{j_1+j_2-j_3}{2})!}.$$
Since we are concerned with the large $j$ limit, apply Stirling's formula,
$$ \frac{a!}{(a/2)!^2} \simeq \frac{2^{a+1/2}}{\sqrt{\pi a}},$$ 
to the previous expression. The square of the 3-j symbol then magically 
simplifies to the inverse area of a triangle having sides $j_1,j_2,j_3$:
\begin{equation}
 \left(\!\!
 \begin{array}{ccc}j_1\!&\!j_2\!&\!j_3\\ 0\!&\!0\!&\!0\end{array}\!\!\right)^2
 \simeq \frac{2\theta(\lambda_E)}{\pi\lambda_E(j_1^2,j_2^2,j_3^2)};
 \qquad \lambda_E^2\equiv -\lambda^2,
\end{equation}
which makes good sense, recalling the vector addition formula for
angular momenta. One finishes with the continuum result
\begin{equation}
 \rho^{D}_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2+m_3}\!=\frac{1}{4\pi^3}
 \int_0\!\!\int_0\!\!\int_0 \!\!d\mu_1\,d\mu_2\,d\mu_3
 \frac{\mu_1\mu_2\mu_3}{\lambda_E(\mu_1^2,\mu_2^2,\mu_3^2)}
 \rho^{D-2}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu_1}+m_{2\mu_2}+m_{3\mu_3}}.
\end{equation}

This recurrence is very difficult to verify in general, especially for even
$D$. We can however make a fist of it for 5-D in the massless limit when
the check collapses to the veracity of
\begin{equation}
 \rho^5_{m_0\rightarrow 0+0+0}\!=\frac{1}{64\pi^4}
 \int_0\!\!\int_0\!\!\int_0 \!\!d\mu_1 d\mu_2 d\mu_3
 \frac{\mu_1\mu_2\mu_3\theta(\lambda_E)}{\lambda_E(\mu_1^2,\mu_2^2,\mu_3^2)}
 \left( 1\!-\frac{\mu_1+\mu_2+\mu_3}{m_0} \right).
\end{equation}
The lhs of (19) is known to equal $m_0^4/53760\pi^3$. To integrate the rhs, 
change variables according to $ \mu_1=w/2-u,\quad\mu_2=w/2-v,
\quad\mu_3=v+u\qquad {\rm so}$,
$$ \int_0\!\!\int_0\!\!\int_0\!\!d\mu_1d\mu_2d\mu_3\,X=2\int_0^{m_0}\!dw
  \int_0^{w/2}\!dv\int_0^{w/2-v}\!du\, X$$
may be carried out with $X\propto 
  \frac{(w/2-u)(w/2-v)(u+v)(m_0-w)}{\sqrt{uv[2w(u+v)-w^2]}}$. The result indeed 
reproduces the lhs. We have also verified the truth of (19) numerically.

The miraculous birth of the Euclidean K\""allen function $\lambda_E$ in (17) 
and (19) can be rendered less mysterious if we look upon this as the result of 
integrating over the last 2 components of momentum $\vec{\mu}$, corresponding 
to a `radial kernel'. Thus from the mathematical fact that
$$\left(\prod_{i=1}^3\int\frac{d^2\vec{\mu_i}}{(2\pi)^2}\right)(2\pi)^2\delta^2
 (\sum_{i=1}^3 \vec{\mu_i})F(|\vec{\mu_j}|) =
 \left(\prod_{i=1}^3 \int\frac{\mu_i d\mu_i d\theta_i}{(2\pi)^2} \right)\!
 F(\mu_j)\!\int\!\!d^2\vec{k}\,\,{\rm e}^{i\vec{k}\cdot\sum\vec{\mu}} $$
we find that this expression equals \cite{GH,MOSGrad}
$$\left(\!\prod_{i=1}^3\!\int\!\frac{\mu_id\mu_i}{2\pi}\!\!\right)\!\!F(\mu_j)
 2\pi\!\!\int_0^\infty\!\!\!\!\!\!J_0(k\mu_1\!)J_0(k\mu_2\!)J_0(k\mu_3\!)\,kdk
=\!\!\left(\!\prod_{i=1}^3\!\int\!\frac{\mu_id\mu_i}{2\pi}\!\!\right)\!
\!\frac{4\theta(\lambda_E)F(\mu_j)}{\lambda_{\!E}(\mu_1^2,\!\mu_2^2,\!\mu_3^2)}.$$
Moreover the extension to $N$-body phase space suggests itself immediately
via an $N$-fold kernel, associated with the integral
$2\pi\!\int_0^\infty\left(\prod_{i=1}^N J_0(k\mu_i)\right)\,kdk$
although this is not readily stated in terms of simple functions for $N>4$;
something geometrical associated with the lengths $\mu_i$ is certainly involved.
This kernel has to be folded over 
$\rho^{D-2}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu_1}+\cdots +m_{N\mu_N}}$
and integrated with respect to all $\mu_i d\mu_i$ to establish the recurrence.

\section{Relations between $D$ and $D-n$ phase space}

With the torus and 2-sphere thoroughly understood, it is natural to extend
the argument to coordinates confined to an $n$-sphere where the topology
is $M^{D-n}\otimes S^n$. Here we need to make use 
of hyperspherical harmonics \cite{Bateman} defined over $n$ angles. Associated 
with them are the generalized quadratic Casimir operator with eigenvalue 
$j(j+n-1)$ and $n-1$ angular momentum components (generically labelled 
${\bf k}$), producing a degeneracy of 
$h_{jn}=(2j+n-1).(j+n-2)!/j!(n-1)!$ Thus the free action may be
normalized according to eq. (11), where
$$\Phi({\bf x},\hat{y}) = \sum_{j,{\bf k}}\phi_{j,{\bf k}}({\bf x})\,
 Y_{j,{\bf k}}(\hat{y})/R^{n/2},$$
and we must sum over $(n-1)$ of the ${\bf k}$ labels. Now the squared mass
equals $m^2 + j(j+n-1)/R^2$ of course, because the last term corresponds to a 
hyperspherical Laplacian eigenvalue \cite{Bateman}.

Running through similar steps as before and skipping details, we arrive at
the two-body recurrence relation for finite $R$,
\begin{equation}
 \rho^D_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2} = \sum_{j} h_{jn}
 \rho^{D-n}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1j}+m_{2j}}/\Omega_nR^n,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_n = 2\pi^{(n+1)/2}/\Gamma((n+1)/2)$ is the total solid angle
corresponding to $n$ angular coordinates. In the limit of large $R$ and 
therefore large $j$, since $h_{jn} \simeq 2j^{n-1}/\Gamma(n)$, we obtain the 
continuum limit,
\begin{equation}
 \rho^D_{m_0\rightarrow m_1+m_2}=\frac{\Gamma((n+1)/2)}{\pi^{(n+1)/2}\Gamma(n)}
 \int_0 d\mu \mu^{n-1} \rho^{D-n}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu}+m_{2\mu}}
\end{equation}
and this is readily checked via the explicit answer (6). Eqs. (7) and (14)
are particular cases of (21).

While we have succeeded in treating the two-body decay by this procedure, it
clearly becomes unwieldy and probably useless for $N>2$ and larger values
of $n$, since we would have to integrate over multiproducts of hyperspherical
harmonics, which are not exactly well-known, though some fancy generalisations 
of 3-j symbols and the like must exist. On the other hand one can make much 
better progress by regarding the recurrence as the result of
integrating over the last $n$ momenta $\vec{\mu}$:
\begin{equation}
 \rho^{D}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1}+\cdots +m_{N}}=
 \left(\prod_{i=1}^N\int\frac{d^n\!\vec{\mu_i}}{(2\pi)^n}\right)
 \int d^n\vec{k}\,\,{\rm e}^{i\vec{k}.\sum_i\vec{\mu_i}} 
 \, \rho^{D-n}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu_1}+\cdots +m_{N\mu_N}}
\end{equation}
Now in general \cite{ADM},
$$\int d^n\!{\vec{\mu}} \exp(i\vec{k}.\vec{\mu})\,f(\mu)=
 \int_0^\infty (2\pi\mu)^{n/2}J_{n/2-1}(k\mu)\,f(\mu)\,d\mu/k^{n/2-1},$$
and $\,d^n\!\vec{k}=k^{n-1}dk\,\Omega_{n-1}=2k^{n-1}d\mu.\pi^{n/2}/\Gamma(n/2)$,
so (20) simplifies to
\begin{eqnarray}
 \rho^{D}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1}+\cdots +m_{N}}&=&
 \left(\prod_{i=1}^N \int_0^\infty\frac{\mu_i^{n/2}d\mu_i}{(2\pi)^{n/2}}\right)
 \int_0^\infty \frac{2\pi^{n/2}k^{n-1}\,dk}{\Gamma(n/2)}\,
 \left(\prod_{i=1}^N \frac{J_{n/2-1}(k\mu_i)}{k^{n/2-1}}\right) \nonumber \\
 &&\qquad\qquad\times\rho^{D-n}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu_1}+\cdots +m_{N\mu_N}}.
\end{eqnarray}
As far as we are aware there is no amenable formula for the radial kernel: an 
integral over the product of $N$ Bessel functions of the first kind with 
different arguments for all $N$. However the cases $N=2$ and $N=3$ are known 
and for positive $a,b,c,$ read \cite{GH}:
$$\int_0^\infty J_\nu(ax)J_\nu(bx)\,xdx=2\delta(a^2-b^2),$$
$$\int_0^\infty J_\nu(ax)J_\nu(bx)J_\nu(cx)\,x^{1-\nu}dx =
 2\theta(\lambda_E)\lambda_E^{2\nu-1}/(8abc)^\nu\Gamma(\nu+1/2)\sqrt{\pi}.$$
For $N=4$ it is even known that \cite{MOSGrad}
$$\int_0^\infty J_0(ax)J_0(bx)J_0(cx)J_0(dx)\,xdx={\bf K}
  \left(\sqrt{abcd}/\Delta\right)/\pi^2\Delta,$$
where $16\Delta^2=(a+b+c-d)(b+c+d-a)(c+d+a-b)(d+a+b-c)$ is associated with the
maximal area of a (cocyclic) quadrilateral formed by the lengths $a,b,c,d$
and ${\bf K}$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. Anyhow,
this means that we may at least write a simple closed form for the three-body
recurrence relation, when $n$ is arbitrary:
\begin{equation}
 \rho^{D}_{m_0\rightarrow m_1\!+m_2\!+m_3}\!=\!\!
 \left(\!\prod_{i=1}^3\!\int_0^\infty\!\frac{\mu_i d\mu_i}{(2\pi)^{n/2}}\!
 \right)\!\!\frac{2^{3-n/2}\theta(\lambda_E)\pi^{n/2-1}}
                    {\lambda_E^{3-n}(\mu^2,\mu_2^2,\mu_3^2)\Gamma(n\!-\!1)}
 \rho^{D-n}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu_1}\!+m_{2\mu_2}\!+m_{3\mu_3}}.
\end{equation}
An interesting case occurs when $N=n=3$, whereupon (24) reduces to
\begin{equation}
 \rho^{D}_{m_0\rightarrow m_1\!+m_2\!+m_3}\!=\!\int_0^\infty\!\!\int_0^\infty\!
 \!\int_0^\infty d\mu_1^2d\mu_2^2d\mu_3^2 \frac{\theta(\lambda_E)}{64\pi^4}
 \rho^{D-3}_{m_0\rightarrow m_{1\mu_1}\!+m_{2\mu_2}\!+m_{3\mu_3}}
\end{equation}
and because 3-D phase space is so simple \cite{Raj}, we obtain an intriguing 
representation for 6-D phase space on setting $D=6$. Specifically,
$$ \rho^6_{m_0\rightarrow m_1\!+m_2\!+m_3}\!\!=\!\int_0^\infty\!\!\!\!\!da
  \!\int_0^\infty\!\!\!\!\!db\!\int_0^\infty\!\!\!\!\!dc
  \frac{\theta(\lambda_E(a,\!b,\!c))}
  {64\pi^4}\frac{m_0\!-\!\sqrt{m_1^2\!+\!a}\!-\!\sqrt{m_2^2\!+\!b}
 \!-\!\sqrt{m_3^2\!+\!c}}{16\pi m_0}.
$$

With larger $N$, presumably the radial kernel on the right of (23) involves all 
lengths $\mu_i$ and something geometrically more complicated than $\lambda_E$, 
connected with the closed figure $\sum_i\vec{\mu_i}=0$. [Thus we expect it to 
vanish when any length exceeds the lengths of the other three, amongst other 
conditions. This is a very interesting topic worth future investigation.]

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we have established the connection between relativistic phase 
space for different dimensions by two methods. They complement Almgren's 
connection between phase space
in the same dimension, but for different numbers of decay products. Our 
recurrence relations have practical utility when the difference in dimensions
$n$ is odd since it leads to elegant symmetrical representations of
$\rho$ for even $D$ involving elliptic functions.

Last but not least, one should observe that phase space is nothing but
the imaginary part of a sunset Feynman diagram. Since recurrence relations
between sunset diagrams differing in dimensionality by 2 have been found by
other methods \cite{DT}, it should be possible to rewrite our results that way, 
for even $n$ at any rate. We should also point out that as a rule those
relations do not connect even and odd $D$ because they are obtained by 
integration by parts from scalar particle Feynman graphs.
