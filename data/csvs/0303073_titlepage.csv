\centerline{\large\textbf {Abstract}}

A Brane evolving in the background of a charged AdS black-hole displays in general a 
{\textit{bouncing}} behaviour with a smooth transition from a contracting to 
an expanding phase. We examine in detail the conditions and consequences of
this behaviour in various cases. For a cosmological-constant-dominated Brane, we
obtain a singularity-free, inflationary era which is shown to be compatible only
with an intermediate-scale fundamental Planck mass. For a radiation-dominated Brane,
the bouncing behaviour can occur only for background-charge
values exceeding those allowed for non-extremal black holes. For a 
matter-dominated Brane, the black-hole mass affects the proper volume or
the expansion rate of the Brane. We also consider the Brane evolving  in an
asymmetric background of two distinct charged AdS
black hole spacetimes being bounded by the Brane and find that, in the case
of an empty critical Brane, bouncing behaviour occurs only if the black-hole
mass difference is smaller than a certain value. The effects of a Brane
curvature term on the bounce at early and late times are also investigated.
