{\large Abstract}\newline
A graphical representation of supersymmetry
is presented. It clearly expresses the chiral flow 
appearing in SUSY quantities, by representing
spinors by {\it directed lines} (arrows). The chiral indices
are expressed by the directions (up, down, left, right)
of the arrows. 
The SL(2,C) invariants are represented by {\it wedges}. 
Both the Weyl spinor and the Majorana spinor
are treated. 
We are free from the messy symbols of spinor indices.
%A visually appealing representation is presented.
The method is applied to the 5D supersymmetry. 
Many applications are expected. 
The result is suitable for coding a computer program
and is highly expected to be applicable to 
various SUSY theories (including Supergravity) 
in various dimensions.

\section{Introduction}
Since supersymmetry was born, more than quarter
century has passed. Although super particles
are not yet discovered in experiments, everybody now
admits its importance as one possible extension
beyond the standard model. Some important models,
such as 4 dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ susy YM 
%and 11 dim supergravity
, give us 
a deep insight in the non-perturbative aspects
of the quantum field theories. 
Because of the high 
symmetry, the dynamics is strongly constrained and
it makes possible to analyse the nonperturbative
aspects. The BPS state is such a
representative. 

The beauty of SUSY
theory comes from the harmony between bosons and fermions. 
At the cost of the high symmetry, the SUSY fields
generally carry many suffixes:\ 
chiral-suffixes ($Calpha$), anti-chiral suffixes (${\dot Calpha}$)
in addition to usual ones:\ 
gauge suffixes ($i,j,..$), Lorentz suffixes ($m,n,\cdots$).
The usual notation is, for example, $\psi^{i~{\dot Calpha}}_{mCalpha}$.
Many suffixes are ``crowded'' within one character $\psi$.
Whether the meaning of a quantity is clearly read, 
sometimes crucially depends on
the way of description. In the case of quantities
with many indices,  
we are sometimes lost in the ``jungle'' of suffixes.
In this circumstance we propose a new representation
to express SUSY quantities.
It has the following properties.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
All suffix-information is expressed.
\item
Suffixes are suppressed as much as possible. 
Instead we use the ""geometrical"" notation:\ lines, arrows, $\cdots$.
\footnote
{In this sense, the use of ``forms'' instead of the
tensorial quantities is the similar line of
simplification.
}
Particularly, 
contracted suffixes (we call them ``dummy'' suffixes) are
expressed by vertices (for fermion suffixes) or lines.
\item
The chiral flow is manifest.
\item
The graphical indices specify a spinorial quantity.
\end{enumerate}

Another quantity with many suffixes
is the Riemann tensor appearing in the general relativity.
It was already graphically represented \cite{SI95CQG}
and some applications have appeared\cite{II97JMP,
GI00CQG}. 
%A computer program\cite{SI98IJMPC}using the graph symbol also appeared.

We follow the notation and the convention of the textbook by
Wess and Bagger\cite{WB92}. Many (graphical) relations
appearing in the present paper (except Sec.6 and Sec.8)
appear in that textbook.

\section{Definition}

\subsection{Basic Ingredients}
Let us represent the Weyl fermion $\psi_Calpha,{\bar \psi}_{\dot Calpha}$
(2 complex components, $Calpha,{\dot Calpha}=1,2,$ ) 
and their 'suffixes-raised' partners as in Fig.1.
Raising and lowering the spinor suffixes is done by
the antisymmetric tensors $\epsilon^{\alpha\beta}, \epsilon_{{\alpha\beta}}$:\ 
%*** def1%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
\psi^Calpha=\epsilon^{\alpha\beta}\psi_Pbeta{\quad ,}\quad
{\bar \psi}^{\dot Calpha}=\epsilon^{{\dot Calpha}{\dot Pbeta}}{\bar \psi}_{\dot Pbeta}{\quad ,}\quad
\epsilon^{12}=\epsilon_{21}=1{\quad ,}
\label{def1}
\end{eqnarray}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $\epsilon^{\alpha\beta}$ and $\epsilon_{\alpha\beta}$ are in the inverse relation:\ 
$\epsilon^{\alpha\beta}\epsilon_{Pbeta"
