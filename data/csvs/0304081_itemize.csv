\item It is a localized wave that solves the wave equation.
  
\item It is a Lorentz covariant classical field configuration that
  lives in physical Minkowski space.

\item 
The field is everywhere finite and nonsingular, and has quadratic
falloff in both space and time.
  
\item The total energy is finite, depending on the peak field and the
  width of the pulse.
  
\item The total action is zero.

\item Like the soliton it lives in physical time (Minkowski space, not
  Euclidean space), and possesses a well-defined 4-velocity.

\item Like the instanton it ``dies away'' in the infinite past and future.
  
\item Like the instanton it possesses a continuously adjustable scale
  parameter.

\item Like the sphaleron it is unstable to dispersal.
