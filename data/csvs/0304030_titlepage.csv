In this paper the Seiberg-Witten map for a time-dependent background
related to a null-brane orbifold is studied. The commutation
relations of the coordinates are linear, i.e. it is an example of the
Lie algebra type. The equivalence map between the Kontsevich star product for
this background and the Weyl-Moyal star product for a background with
constant noncommutativity parameter is also studied.
