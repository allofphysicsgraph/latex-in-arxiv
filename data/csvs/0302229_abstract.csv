The exact fermion propagator in a classical time-dependent gauge field is
derived by solving the equation of motion for the Dirac Green's functions.
From the retarded propagator obtained in this way the momentum spectrum for
the produced fermion pairs is calculated. Different approximations and the
exact solution for the propagator and the momentum spectrum are presented.
