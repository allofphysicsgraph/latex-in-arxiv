\caption{Here you can see the z-plane and the u-plane and how
the loops are mapped. The imaginary axis between the cuts in the z-plane
are mapped to the imaginary axis in the u-plane, where $\omega=0$
and the imaginary axis above the cut in the z-plane is mapped to
the line $u=\pm \omega$ and $z=\pm 2\beta$ goes to $u=\pm \omega'$.}
