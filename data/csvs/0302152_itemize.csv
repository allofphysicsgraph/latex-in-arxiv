\item We have clarified the physical meaning of
non-discrete-torsion orbifold group actions on $B$ fields,
by showing those additional orbifold group actions correspond to 
momentum-shift phases \cite{dgh,katrin}.
The answer was implicit in our previous work \cite{medt}; we have
hopefully clarified the matter here.
Also, in principle our methods allow us to make sense of momentum-shift
phases for orbifolds of non-simply-connected spaces other than tori,
though we have not pursued that possibility.
\item We have explicitly described the M-theory dual of IIA discrete torsion,
which is slightly obscure as M theory has no $B$ field.
