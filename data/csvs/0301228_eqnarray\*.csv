where $ R_{0}=R(r_{0},\tau) $.  Substituting Eqs. $(26-29)$ back
into Eq. $(17)$ and noting that for the metric LTB, $ F(r_{0}) $
is just the square of the Schwarzschild radius of the part of the
spherical thick brane within the comoving surface $ r_{0} $
denoted by $ {\cal R} (r_{0}) $, we obtain after some
simplification and rearrangement the equation of motion of the
dust thick brane written up to the first-order in $\delta $
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha-\beta= \delta \frac{F^{'}(r_{0})}
{R_{0}^2\left(1+\dot{R}_{0}^2-\frac{F(r_{0})}{R_{0}^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad

\hspace*{3.5cm}-\delta \left( \frac{R^{'}_{0}}{R_{0}}(\alpha -

R_{0}^2}\Bigl({\cal R}^{'}(r_{0})+\frac{R^{'}_{0}}{R_{0}}{\cal
R}(r_{0})\Bigr)\right),
\end{eqnarray*}
with
\begin{equation}
\label{alpabeta2} \alpha\equiv(1+\dot{R}_{0}^2)^\frac{1}{2}
,\quad\quad  \beta\equiv\left(1+\dot{R}_{0}^2 -\frac{{\cal R}^2
(r_{0})}{R_{0}^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}.
\end{equation}
Now, we would like to explore the zero-thickness limit of our
formalism applied to the collapse of a dust thick brane in
vacuum. In order to do this, we take the following definition for
the four dimensional energy density of the infinitely thin brane
[9]
\begin{equation}
\rho=\int_{-\epsilon}^\epsilon\check{\rho}(r,\tau)dn ,
\end{equation}
where $ n $ is the proper distance in the direction of the normal
$ n_{\mu} $ and $ 2\epsilon$ is the proper thickness of the shell,
with the metric $(1)$, the definition $(32)$ takes the form
\begin{equation}
\rho=\int_{-\delta}^\delta
\check{\rho}(r,\tau)\frac{R^{'}(r,\tau)}{\left(1+E(r)\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}dr.
\end{equation}
Using Eqs. $(9-10)$, we see that Eq. $(33)$ can therefore be
written as
\begin{equation}
16\pi G_{5}
\rho=\int_{-\delta}^\delta\frac{3F^{'}(r)}{R^3\left(1+\dot{R}^2-\frac{F(r)}{R^2}
\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}dr.
\end{equation}
Now, by using Eqs. $(23-24)$, we may integrate Eq. $(34)$ up to
the first order in $ \delta $ to yield
\begin{equation}
16\pi G_{5}\rho =
\frac{3F^{'}(r_{0})}{R^3_{0}\left(1+\dot{R}^2_{0}
-\frac{F(r_{0})}{R_{0}^2} \right)^\frac{1}{2}}2\delta + {\cal
O}(\delta^2).
\end{equation}
Substituting $(35)$ back into Eq. $(30)$, we find the following
result
\begin{equation}
\label{alpabeta3}
 \alpha - \beta =
 \frac{8\pi G_{5}}{3}\rho
R_{0}-\delta \left(\frac{R^{'}_{0}}{R_{0}}(\alpha -
\beta)+\dot{{R}_{0}} \dot{{R}^{'}_{0}}(\frac{\alpha - \beta}
{\alpha\beta})+\frac{{\cal R}(r_{0})}{\beta R_{0}^2}\Bigl({\cal
R'} (r_{0})+\frac{R^{'}_{0}}{R_{0}}{\cal R}(r_{0})\Bigr)\right).
\end{equation}
Note that in the zero thickness limit of the brane as $ \delta
\rightarrow 0$, the second term on the right hand side of Eq.
$(36)$ is regular and goes to zero such that Eq. $(36)$ reduces to
the Israel's equation of motion written for the dust thin brane in
vacuum(see [9,10] for the dust thin shell in 4D gravity). To see
the explicit effect of the finite thickness on the thick brane
dynamical equation $(36)$ obtained up to the first order in $
\delta $, we rewrite it as
\begin{equation}
\label{alpabeta4} \alpha-\beta=\frac{8\pi G_{5}}{3}\varrho R_{0},
\end{equation}
where $ \varrho $ is defined by
\begin{equation}
\varrho=\rho-\frac{3\delta}{8\pi
G_{5}R_{0}}\left(\frac{R^{'}_{0}}{R_{0}}
(\alpha-\beta)+\dot{R}_{0}\dot{R}^{'}_{0}(\frac{\alpha-\beta}{\alpha\beta})
+\frac{{\cal R}(r_{0})}{\beta R_{0}^2}\Bigl({\cal R'}
(r_{0})+\frac{R^{'}_{0}}{R_{0}}{\cal R}(r_{0})\Bigr)\right).
\end{equation}
Equation (37) has the same form as the well-known Israel's
junction equation for a thin brane with the effective energy
density $\varrho$.\\
 Now, for a dust brane starting its collapse at rest, the
velocity $\dot{R}_{0}$, being negative during the collapse,
becomes more negative with increasing $r$, i.e. $\dot{R'}_{0}< 0$.
Therefore, the combination $\dot{R}_{0}\dot{R'}_{0}$ is positive.
On the other hand, the Schwarzschild radius of the brane layers
are increased with $r$ so that ${\cal R'} (r_{0})>0$. We therefore
see that all terms within the bracket on the right hand side of
Eq. (38) are positive, meaning that $\varrho<\rho$.\\
 Now, solving Eq. (37) for $\dot{R}^{2}$ we get
\begin{equation}
\dot{R}_{0}^{2} =\frac{16}{9}\pi^{2} G_{5}^{2} R_{0}^{2}
\varrho^{2}+\frac{9{\cal R}^{4}
(r_{0})}{256\pi^{2}G_{5}^{2}R_{0}^{6} \varrho^{2}} +\frac{{\cal
R}^2 (r_{0})}{2R_{0}^2} -1.
\end{equation}
From Eq. (39), it follows that for a given $R_{0}$ and ${\cal R}
(r_{0})$, as long as $R_{0}>{\cal R}(r_{0})$, smaller $\varrho
(\varrho <\rho )$ leads to a larger $\dot{R}^{2}$. Therefore, the
first-order thickness corrections to the Israel thin brane
approximation yield a faster collapse of the dust brane in vacuum.
\subsection*{III. Conclusions}
\hspace*{0.5cm}Motivated by the idea that our universe  is a slice
of a higher dimensional spacetime, we have applied our earlier
approach based on the Darmois matching conditions to obtain the
dynamical equation describing the motion of a spherical thick
3-brane for which the matter on it is in the form of a dust fluid,
the bulk is empty, and no cosmological constants were
introduced.\\
It turns out that the effect of thickness up to the first order in
the brane thickness is to speed up the collapse of the brane in
vacuum. Our results have a well defined zero thickness limit which
are just the Israel thin shell approximation for 3-branes. In the
present work, we have made a number of assumptions to simplify the
analysis. It would be interesting to see how the results may be
changed by relaxing some of these assumptions. For example, what
would be changed if instead of comoving thickness of the brane the
proper brane thickness is assumed to be constant in time. What
would be the effect of taking into account the peculiar velocity
of the brane layers with respect to the background?  An obvious
generalization would also be a non-zero cosmological constant in
the bulk. A non-zero pressure fluid in the brane is another
interesting generalization.\\
