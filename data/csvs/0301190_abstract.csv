Three-dimensional gravity with a minimally coupled self-interacting scalar
is considered. 
The fall-off of the fields at infinity is assumed to be
slower than that of a localized distribution of matter, so that the
asymptotic symmetry group is the conformal group.

The counterterm Lagrangian needed to render the action finite is found
by demanding that the action attain an extremum for the boundary conditions
implied by the above fall-off of the fields at infinity. These counterterms 
explicitly depend on the scalar field. As a consequence, the Brown-York
stress-energy tensor acquires a non trivial contribution from the matter
sector.

Static circularly symmetric solutions with a regular scalar field are
explored for a one-parameter family of potentials. Their masses are computed 
via the Brown-York quasilocal stress-energy tensor, and they coincide with
the values obtained from the Hamiltonian approach. The thermal behavior,
including the transition between different configurations, is analyzed, and
it is found that the scalar black hole can decay into the BTZ solution
irrespective of the horizon radius.

It is also shown that the AdS/CFT correspondence yields the same central
charge as for pure gravity.
