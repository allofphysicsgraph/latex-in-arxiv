  Abelian  dual superconductor   -    with dynamical Abelianization.    
  The effective action has the form of a magnetic $U(1)^{R}$  gauge theory, where 
  $R=$   rank of $G_c$. 
 

{\footnotesize [Examples are: $r=0,1 $ vacua in $SU(n_c);$   also   all vacua in theories with  $n_f=0$]};   

  

\item   
% {(2)}   
  Confinement by condensation of non-Abelian dual quarks    of effective
   $SU(r)  \times   U(1)^{n_c-r+1} $  theory; 

{\footnotesize [ $r=2,3,\ldots, [{n_f-1  \over  2}]$   vacua   of $SU(n_c)$;  also 
   $USp(2n_c), SO(n_c)$ models with $m\ne 0$ ]}

%{(3)}
     Confining vacua  which are   deformed   superconformal theories  
{\footnotesize [ $r= {n_f  \over 2}$   vacua of $SU(n_c)$;  also all confining vacua 
in $USp(2n_c), SO(n_c)$ models with $m= 0$ ]. }   

  

\item 
% {(4)} 
 There exist also   vacua in free-magnetic phase, with   no confinement, no DSB,   for theories with larger
$n_f$ (e.g.  $ n_f \ge  n_c, $   in  $SU(n_c)$.)

\item At $\rho=0$,  the small  branch points are  at  $(2 i,\,-2 i,\,2,\,-2)$
so that one finds  for $\tau_{11}$
$$  { 1\over 2 }  =    {  {{\vartheta}_3}^4(0  \, |  \tau_{11} )
 \over   {{\vartheta}_2}^4(0\, | \tau_{11} )  }, \label{modular} $$

$$ \tau_{11}=\frac{\pm 1+i}{2}, \qquad  \frac{\pm 3+i}{10},   \qquad   \ldots \label{tau}  $$

\item four monopole doublets $(\mp 1,0)^4$    cancel the contribution  of the gauge multiplets;
\item a dyon doublet $(\pm 2, \pm1)$  and an electric doublet   $(0, \pm1)$ cancel  each other as  
$$\sum_i (q_i+m_i
\tau)^2  =  1 + (2\, \tau  +1)^2=0, \qquad   {\hbox{\rm  for }}    \quad     \tau^*=\frac{-1+i}{2}:  $$
showing a nice (non-Abelian) generalization of Argyres-Douglas'   mechanism;  
\item   in the second section cancellation occurs because both the charges and the coupling constant $\tau^{*}$
get transformed   by  $ p_1=\pmatrix{-1& 4 \cr 0 & -1 }$,   and the above argument works for  
  $(\pm 4, \mp1)$ 
and   $(\pm 2,  \mp 1)$   with  
$\tau^*=    { 3 + i
\over10}$!   
This strengthens  our idea that different sections  are simply  different descriptions of the same physics.

\item   no dynamical Abelianization is known to occur; 
    
\item    on the other hand,   in QCD  with $n_f$  flavor,     the original and dual beta functions have the first coefficients
($n_c=3$, ${\tilde n}_c=2,3$)
$$  b_0=   - 11 \, n_c +  2 \,n_f \quad  {\hbox {\rm vs}} \quad   {\tilde b}_0  =  - 11 \, {\tilde n}_c +   n_f:    $$
they have the same sign  because of the large coefficient  in front of the color  multiplicity  ({\it cfr.} Eq.(\ref{betafund})).
