\caption{\it{Modifications for scalar perturbations due to the extra dimension. The line on the top is for $m=0, \lambda=0$, which is the spectrum generated in the conventional four-dimensional inflation. The other three lines are for nonzero $m, \lambda$, which show spectrum in the brane world inflation. We take $H=1, l=10-100$ in the calculations.}}
