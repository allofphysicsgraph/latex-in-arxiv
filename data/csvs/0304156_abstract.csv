We show how to get the one-loop beta function and the 
chiral anomaly of ${\cal N}=1$ Super QCD from a stack of fractional $N$ D3-branes localized 
inside the world-volume of $2M$ fractional D7-branes on the orbifold $C^3/(Z_2 \times Z_2)$. They are obtained by analyzing the classical supergravity background generated by such a brane configuration, in the spirit of the gauge/gravity
correspondence.
