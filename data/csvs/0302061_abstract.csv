By putting a confined inter source, we construct a model which can
give us convergent solution from free field equation. On the other
hand, the solution of new field equation can be separated into two
parts, one part is just same as the one in Quantum Field Theory
and make it survived in this model, and the other part, which we
will see doesn't take energy and momentum, just gives us a
negative propagator which can soften quadratic divergence.
