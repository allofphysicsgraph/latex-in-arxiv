We propose an alternative interpretation for the meaning of noncommutativity
of the string inspired field theories and quantum mechanics. Arguments are
presented to show that the noncommutativity generated in the stringy context
ought be assumed to be only between the particle coordinate observables, and
not of the spacetime coordinates. Some implications of this fact for
noncomutative field theories and quantum mechanics are discussed. In
particular, a consistent interpretation is given for the wavefunction in
quantum mechanics.\ An analysis of the noncommutative theories\ in the
Schr\""{o}dinger formulation employing a generalized quantum Hamilton-Jacobi
formalism originated from the polar decomposition of the wavefunction
revealed a formal structure for noncommutative quantum mechanics richer than
the one of noncommutative quantum field theory. Conditions for the classical
and commutative limits of these theories were also determined and applied in
some examples.\vspace{2cm}
