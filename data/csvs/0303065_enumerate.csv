\item All the flavors have the same mass $m_i=m$. The generalization to the case with different masses is straightforward. As described above the branches of a single gauge group factor with massless fundamentals are labeled by an integer $r$.  When there are different masses, the possible branches will be more intricate and will be labeled by a set of integers  $(r_1,r_2,...,r_k)$.   More interesting interpolations between vacua can then occur.  


\item
We have restricted ourselves  to superpotentials $W(x)$ such that $-m$  is one of the roots of $W'(x)$. This is for the following reason: if $W'(-m)\neq 0$, $Q,\widetilde{Q}$ (which are flavors under the gauge group factor $U(N_i)$ arising from $N_i$ diagonal entries of $-m$ in the VEV of $\Phi$)  must necessarily have non-zero VEVs and hence the gauge group $U(N_i)$ would be completely Higgsed. Thus we will be reduced to the case in which there are no massless flavors under any of the gauge group factor. The latter situation has already been discsussed in \cite{Cachazo:2002zk}.  

\item We mostly consider an even number of flavors (except for one example). The reason is that the computations in examples with an odd number of flavors are more involved. However, we expect that the difference between even and odd flavors is technical and will not lead to significantly different physical phenomena.

\item  $Q =\tilde{Q}=0$, which leaves $U(1)$ unbroken (we will  call this the $r=0$ vacuum).
\item
$U(1)$ is Higgsed by nonzero VEVs of squarks.
By flavor symmetry, we can set $Q=[K,0,0,...,0]$ and 
$\widetilde{Q}=[0,K,0,...,0]$. The unbroken flavor symmetry is
$SU(M_i-2)\times U(1)$.   We will call  this $r=1$ vacuum since the squark VEVs match the form of the $r=1$ Higgs branch described in the previous section.

\item  ${\psi_B\over N_i}+\Lambda x_k \neq 0,~~\forall k$ . This implies that
\begin{equation} \psi_k=0, ~~~~ e_k,\widetilde{e}_k \neq 0 ~~~{\mathrm for} ~~~~ k=1,...,N_i-r ~~~
\mathrm{and}  ~~~~~\Tr(q\widetilde{q})={ \mu \psi_B r \over \sqrt{2} N_i}.\end{equation}
{\em i.e.}  $U(1)^{N_i-r}$ is higgsed. The remaining
equations for $q,\widetilde{q}, \phi$ are:
\begin{eqnarray}
0 & = & [\phi,\phi^\dagger]=q^i_a (q^\dagger)^b_i
-(\widetilde{q}^\dagger)^i_a\widetilde{q}^b_i, \\
0 & = & \sqrt{2} q^i_a \widetilde{q}^b_i-{\sqrt{2}\over r} \delta_a^b 
(q^i_c \widetilde{q}^c_i)+\mu \phi_a^b,\\
0 & = & (\phi^a_b-{N_i\over r}\psi_B \delta^a_b) q^i_a=\widetilde{q}^b_i (
\phi^a_b-{N_i\over r}\psi_B \delta^a_b), \\
0 & = & \sqrt{2}\Tr(q\widetilde{q})-{ \mu \psi_B r \over  N_i}.
\end{eqnarray}
These equations are exactly the same equations for general $r$-th
branch (\ref{3.4}, \ref{3.7}) with $-N_i \psi_B \rightarrow \psi_0$ and $-{\psi_B r\over N_i}
\rightarrow x_0$. Hence the general solution is given by (\ref{small-q}).   In the general $r$-th branch, the authors of  \cite{Carlino:2000uk}  argued that the solutions in (\ref{small-q}) with $l<r$ cannot be trusted and do not exist quantum mechanically.  In the present case, however, all the solutions in (\ref{small-q}) with both $l<r$ and $l=r$ are valid
\cite{Carlino:2000uk} because all $\psi_k,\psi_B\sim  0$ and therefore are far from the dynamical scale of the theory.   Following the discussion below (\ref{small-q}), the $l<r$ vacua have a $SU(r-l) \times U(1)$ at low energies and the $SU$ factor confines leaving $r-l$ discrete vacua.   These vacua are the strong coupling limit of the situations with degenerate meson fields $M$ in the weak coupling analysis  in Sec.~\ref{weak} of the cases with more flavors than colors where we found $\widetilde{N}_i - l = M_i - N_i - l$ vacua.   For $l<r$ although the $U(1)^{N_i-r}$ facotr is higgsed,
there is one decoupled $U(1)\subset U(r)$ left while for $l=r$, there is no
$U(1)$ left and the whole theory is higgsed.
\item ${\psi_B\over N_i}+\Lambda x_{k_0} = 0$ for a particular
$k_0$ (because in general all $x_k$ are different). 
\newline Then,  we can have 
$e_{k_0}=\widetilde{e}_{k_0}=0$ with nonzero $\psi_{k_0}$. Thus, one of the monopoles does not condense in this case and 
only $N_i-r-1$ of the $U(1)$ factors  will be Higgsed down.  The remaining
equations for $q,\widetilde{q}, \phi$ in this case will be similar to
the generic $r$'th branch with the role of $\psi_B$ replaced by $\psi_{k_0}$.  Since only $N_i - r -1$ monopoles are condensed this is in fact one of the generic $r$'th branches that we discussed earlier in this section.   There are $N_i-r$ ways to choose $k_0$ which leads to $N_i-r=2N_i-M_i$. This matches the weak coupling counting. So following the discussion in \cite{Carlino:2000uk}  we once again only keep the $l=r$ solutions in (\ref{small-q}) .

\item Non-baryonic $r$'th branch: The factorization problem has
two parameters, thus by solving it we are
restricted to a two-parameter subspace of the Coulomb moduli
space. We will use equation (\ref{flavor-F_2n}) to find
 the tree level superpotential and equations relating the two parameters of the Coulomb moduli space to  the roots of superpotenital  $m,\alpha$.
 Then we discuss various semiclassical limits and possible
interpolations between them.   After that we will fix
the superpotential and  count the
number of vacua to check the general formulae given in previous
section.

\item Baryonic $r$'th branch: The factorization problem has only one
parameter. Also here the gauge group breaking patterns are very
restrictive:  we must have $N_1=r$ or $N_1=N_f-r$, and for either
case the number of vacua is $N_2=N_c-N_1$. 
Because of this the possible
semiclassical limits are completely determined.  We will show how this follows from the SW curve and explore the possible smooth interpolations between baryonic vacua.  We will only determine the tree level superpotential and count the number of vacua  for one example.  This is because an additional monopole is condensed in this case and therefore (\ref{flavor-F_2n}) should be generalized  before it  can be directly applied to determine the superpotential.

the constraints, only one of $b,c$ goes to zero if we keep 
keeping $\frac{\Lambda^3}{m-a}$ fixed. Suppose $b$ is finite\footnote{Since $b$ and $c$ appear symmetrically, when $c$ is kept finite, we get the same solution.}, then
$P_4(x)\rightarrow (x+m)^2(x+m+b)^2$.  This leads to a semiclassical limit with two gauge group factors.

$m\rightarrow 0$, and we can keep $v=\frac{\Lambda^3}{a^2}$ fixed. The

to keep $m$ finite by taking the limit $(\frac{a}{\Lambda}-1)\sim

$U(4)\rightarrow \widehat{U(1)}\times U(3)$.

Then  from (\ref{17}),  find two solutions 
$m_1=a$ or $m_2=-a$ when  the second and fourth term in
(\ref{17}) dominates, and the third solution $m_3\sim
\frac{a^3}{\Lambda^2}$ blows up in the $\Lambda \rightarrow 0$ limit . We will ignore this solution. For $m_1$ and $m_2$ we obtain $P_4(x)\rightarrow (x+a)^2(x-a)^2$ which implies that
the breaking pattern is  $U(4)\rightarrow \widehat{U(2)}\times U(2)$.


\item  $\Lambda\rightarrow 0$, and $a\sim \Lambda^p$ with
$0<p\leq 1$. The asymptotic behavior of $m_{1,2,3}$ can be read
off from (\ref{17}). We find the solutions  $m_{1,2}\sim \pm a$ when
second and fourth term in (\ref{17}) dominate and $m_3\sim
\frac{a^3}{\Lambda^2}$ when the first and second terms dominate. 
Thus for $m_{1,2}$ we obtain $P_4(x)\rightarrow x^4$, which yields a 
singular limit since there is only one gauge group factor. For $m_3$ if
$0<p<\frac{2}{3}$ the solution blows up and should be discarded. If
$\frac{2}{3}<p\leq 1$ we obtain $P_4(x)\rightarrow x^4$, which is a
singular limit. 
For $p=\frac{2}{3}$
we obtain a smooth semiclassical limit. In this case
$m_3=\frac{a^3}{\Lambda^2}$, and we obtain $P_4(x)\rightarrow
x^3(x+m_3)$. Hence the breaking pattern is $U(4)\rightarrow
\widehat{U(1)}\times U(3)$.

The asymptotic behavior of $m_{1,2,3}$ can be again read off from
(\ref{17}). We find $m_{1,2}\sim \pm ia$ and $m_3\sim -\frac{a^3}{\Lambda^2}$ 
For $m_{1,2}$ we get $P_4(x)\rightarrow x^3(x-\frac{2\Lambda^2}{a})$,

group breaks into $U(4)\rightarrow U(1)\times \widehat{U(3)}$. For $m_{3}$ we have $P_4(x)\rightarrow x^3(x-\frac{\Lambda^2}{a})$, which is a singular limit unless

In this case $\Lambda/a$ is small. Then $m_{1,2}\sim\pm
(\frac{a^3}{\Lambda})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $m_{3,4}\sim\pm a$. For
the solutions $m_{1,2}$, we find that $m \gg a$ in the $\Lambda \rightarrow 0$ limit. To get a  finite $z^+$, we require
$\Lambda/a^3\sim 1$,  so the constant term (in $z_+$) drops out and we get
$P_4(x)\rightarrow x^3(x+m)$ with $p=\frac{1}{3}$. In this  case
the breaking pattern is $U(4)\rightarrow \widehat{U(1)}\times U(3)$. 
From the solutions $m_{3,4}$ we always obtain a singular limit $P_4(x)\rightarrow x^4 $.
