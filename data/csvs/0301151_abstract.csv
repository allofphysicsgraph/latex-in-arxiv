 Stability of AdS space allows scalar fields to have negative
 mass squared as long as the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound is
 satisfied. In a compactification
 of AdS instead, to avoid instabilities, a tachyonic bulk mass
 must be supplemented by appropriate brane actions.
 In this paper we clarify the meaning of the lower bound in the
 Randall-Sundrum scenario with two branes
 and explain how the instability disappears in the
 infinite space limit. A CFT
 interpretation is also given as radiative symmetry breaking.
