  \item Lemma \ref{ind} gives us intuition of a geometric interpretation of
the quantization: locally the classical Poisson algebra can be identified with
a free commutative algebra generated by $1$-cycles $H_1(\S,\Z)$ with the
Poisson structure given by the intersection index.
There is an obvious but rather tautological quantization of this Poisson
algebra in geometric terms. One has a noncommutative
multiplication on $H^*(\S)$ which is just a wedge product.
On the first cohomologies it restricts as $$H^1(\S)\times H^1(\S)\longrightarrow
H^2(\S).$$ Due to Poincar\'e duality one can identify $H^1(\S,\Z)$ with
$H_1(\S,\Z)$ and $H^2(\S,\Z)$ with $H_0(\S,\Z).$ In fact this
anticommutative multiplication on cycles coincides with the intersection
index $$c_1*c_2=\#(c_1,c_2).$$ It corresponds to the quantization condition up to
the constant $2$ $$c_1*c_2-c_2*c_1=2\#(c_1,c_2).$$

A question here is to investigate different ways of quantizing this Poisson
algebra and to understand its geometric meaning. Some recent advances in
this direction were realized in \cite{Smi} where the deformed
abelian differentials were introduced and a noncommutative multiplication
over them was constructed. Let us mention that this multiplication is far
from being trivial, however it is anticommutative.
  \item We hope that the appearance of the new object in the context of Hitchin-type
systems -- the lagrangian connection, which we used for splitting the
factorization of the tangent space to the phase space, is not accidental.
Eventually it is not significant on the classical level. However it contains
some intrinsic geometrical data which could be responsible for quantum
deformations.
