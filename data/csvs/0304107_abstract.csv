Free scalar field theory in the sector with a large number of
particles can be interpreted as bosonic string theory on 
anti-de~Sitter space of vanishing radius. Different ways of writing the field
theory Hamiltonian translate to different ways of reparametrizing
the world-sheet $\sigma$ coordinate. Adding a mass term in the
field theory corresponds to cutting off the warped AdS direction,
with cut-off inversely proportional to the mass. The string theory
has neither tachyon, nor critical dimension.
