Bousso's entropy bound for two-dimensional gravity 
is investigated in the lightcone gauge. 
It is shown that due to the Weyl anomaly, 
the null component of the energy-momentum tensor 
takes a nonvanishing value, 
and thus, combined with the conditions that were recently proposed 
by Bousso, Flanagan and Marolf, 
a holographic entropy bound similar to Bousso's 
is expected to hold in two dimensions. 
A connection of our result to that of Strominger and Thompson 
is also discussed.
