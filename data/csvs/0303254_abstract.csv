{ I discuss several aspects of CP non-invariance in the strongly
interacting theory of quarks and gluons.  I use a simple effective
Lagrangian technique to map out the region of quark masses where CP
symmetry is spontaneously broken.  I then turn to the possible
explicit CP violation arising from a complex quark mass.  After
summarizing the definition of the renormalized theory as a limit, I
argue that attempts to remove the CP violation by making the lightest
quark mass vanish are not well defined.  I close with some warnings
for lattice simulations.}
