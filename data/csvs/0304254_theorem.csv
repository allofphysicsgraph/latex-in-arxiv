%
The $\hat{Q}$-cohomology can be non-zero only at zero ghost number 
%$H^n(\hat{\cal H}, \hQ)=0$ for $n\neq 0$ 
if the matter part of the Hilbert space $ {\cal H} $ can be decomposed as a sum of the following two Verma modules:
%\marginpar{$K$: unitary}
\begin{equation}
%
{{\cal H}_{h^{\rm 0},h^{K}} = \cal V}(c^0=1, h^{\rm 0}<0) \otimes {\cal V}(c^{K}=25, h^{K}>0).
%\otimes \mbox{Fock}(b_{-m}, c_{-m}).
\label{eq:hilbert}
%
\end{equation}
(Or more generally, the $c^0=1$ part is written as nondegenerate Verma modules.)

Physical states do not contain Fadeev-Popov ghosts if $ {\cal H} $ is decomposed as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:hilbert}).
