The NAHE--set, that underlies the realistic free fermionic models,
corresponds to $\bb{Z}_2\times \bb{Z}_2$ orbifold at an enhanced
symmetry point, with $(h_{11},h_{21})=(27,3)$. Alternatively, a
manifold with the same data is obtained by starting with a
$\bb{Z}_2\times \bb{Z}_2$ orbifold at a generic point on the
lattice and adding a freely acting $\bb{Z}_2$ involution. In this
paper we study type I orientifolds on the manifolds that underly
the NAHE--based models by incorporating such freely acting shifts.
We present new models in the Type I vacuum which are modulated by
$\bb{Z}_2^n$ for $n=2,3$.  In the case of $n=2$, the
$\bb{Z}_2\times \bb{Z}_2$ structure is a composite orbifold Kaluza
Klein shift arrangement. The partition function provides a simpler
spectrum with chiral matter.  For $n=3$, the two cases discussed
are $\bb{Z}_2$ modulations of the $T^6/\bb{Z}_2 \times \bb{Z}_2$
spectrum.  The additional projection shows an enhanced closed and
open sector with chiral matter.  The second example involves a
modulation using a product of Kaluza Klein and winding shifts. The
winding shift provides this model with a simpler torus spectrum,
particularly with the removal of part of the twisted sector.  In
each of the cases the brane stacks are correspondingly altered
from those which are present in the $\bb{Z}_2\times \bb{Z}_2$
orbifold. The last two incorporate twisted terms that can provide
discrete torsion, we discuss the spectral content of each model
with discrete torsion with particular choice $\epsilon=(1,1,-1)$.
