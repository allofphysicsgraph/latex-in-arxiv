Hamiltonian systems with functionally dependent constraints (irregular
systems), for which the standard Dirac procedure is not directly applicable,
are discussed. They are classified according to their behavior in the
vicinity of the constraint surface into two fundamental types. If the
irregular constraints are multilinear (type I), then it is possible to
regularize the system so that the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions
are equivalent. When the constraints are power of a linear function (type
II), regularization is not always possible and the Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian descriptions may be dynamically inequivalent. It is shown that
the inequivalence between the two formalisms can occur if the kinetic energy
is an indefinite quadratic form in the velocities. It is also shown that a
system of type I can evolve in time from a regular configuration into an
irregular one, without any catastrophic consequences.
