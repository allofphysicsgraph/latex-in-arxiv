Newton potential has been evaluated for the case of dS brane embedded 
in Minkowski, dS$_5$ and AdS$_5$ bulks. We point out that
only the AdS$_5$ bulk
might be consistent with the Newton's law from the brane-world
viewpoint when we respect 
a small cosmological constant
observed at present universe.
