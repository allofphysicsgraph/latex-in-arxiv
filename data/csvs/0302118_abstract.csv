We consider evolution of compact extra dimensions in cosmology and try
to see whether wrapped  branes can prevent the expansion of the internal
space. Some difficulties of Brandenberger and Vafa mechanism for
decompactification are pointed out. In both pure Einstein and dilaton
gravities, we study cosmology of winding brane gases in a continuum
approximation. The energy momentum tensor is obtained by coupling the
brane action to the gravity action and we present several exact
solutions for various brane configurations. T-duality invariance of
the solutions are established in dilaton gravity. Our results indicate
that phenomenologically the most viable scenario can be realized when
there is only one brane wrapping over all extra dimensions.
