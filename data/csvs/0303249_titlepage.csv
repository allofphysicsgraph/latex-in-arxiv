%ABSTRACT

\begin{abstract}




Gravity may be ``locally localized'' over a wide range of length
scales on a $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter ($AdS$) brane living inside
$AdS_{d+1}$.  In this paper we examine this phenomenon from the point
of view of the holographic dual ``defect conformal field theory''.
The mode expansion of bulk fields on the gravity side is shown to be
precisely dual to the ``boundary operator product expansion'' of
operators as they approach the defect.  From the field theory point of
view, the condition for localization is that a ``reduced operator''
appearing in this expansion acquires negative anomalous dimension.  In
particular, a very light localized graviton exists when a mode arising
from the reduction of the ambient stress-energy tensor to the defect
has conformal dimension $\Delta \sim d-1$.  The part of the stress
tensor containing the defect dynamics has dimension $\Delta = d-1$ in
the free theory, but we argue that it acquires a positive anomalous
dimension in the interacting theory, and does not participate in
localization in the regime of small backreaction of the brane.  We
demonstrate that such an anomalous dimension is consistent with the
conservation of the full stress-energy tensor.  Finally, we analyze
how to compute the anomalous dimensions of reduced operators from
gravity at leading order in the interactions with the brane.
