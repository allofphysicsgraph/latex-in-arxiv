In conclusion, any potential made of products of
$\rho_{r}$ and $\rho_{l}$  necessarily
breaks the conformal invariance.

\setcounter{equation}{0}\ssection{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

An interesting feature of the model studied here
is the two--way Galilean symmetry, and one can be
puzzled how this can happen. Let us consider the ``Moyalized''
counterpart of ${\cal L}_{0}$, namely
\begin{equation}
     {\cal L}_{0}^\star
     =i\bar{\psi}\star\p_{t}\psi-
     \frac{1}{2}\vnabla\psi\star\vnabla\bar{\psi}
     \label{staraction}
\end{equation}
Now the conventional implementation (\ref{convbimp})
of the boosts is natural for ${\cal L}_{0}$,
as is (\ref{ncbimp})
for ${\cal L}_{0}^\star$. But the integral property
$\int\! f\star g=\int\! fg$ implies  that ${\cal L}_{0}$
and ${\cal L}_{0}^\star$ are equivalent, so one can use either
of them to describe a free field.
This resolves the paradox which says that
noncommutativity does not alter the free theory.
