We show that, contrary to common belief,
the propagation of a spin-2 field in an electromagnetic background is
{\em causal}. The proof will be given in the Fierz formalism which, as we shall see,
is free of the ambiguity present in the more usual Einstein representation.
We shall also
review the proof in this latter representation.
