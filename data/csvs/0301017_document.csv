We work out the decomposition of the indefinite Kac Moody algebras
${E_{10}}$ and ${E_{11}}$ w.r.t. their respective subalgebras $A_9$ and $A_{10}$
at low levels. Tables of the irreducible representations with their 
outer multiplicities are presented for ${E_{10}}$ up to level $\ell = 18$ 
and for ${E_{11}}$ up to level $\ell =10$. On the way we confirm and extend 
existing results for ${E_{10}}$ root multiplicities, and for the first time 
compute non-trivial root multiplicities of ${E_{11}}$.

\section{Introduction}

In this contribution, we will be mainly concerned with the indefinite
Kac Moody algebras $E_{10}$ and $E_{11}$ (see \cite{Kac,MP} for the basic 
theory of Kac Moody algebras). Of these $E_{10}$ is hyperbolic (all 
its proper regular subalgebras are either finite or affine), while 
$E_{11}$ is not (its regular subalgebra $E_{10}$ is neither finite 
nor affine). Consideration of these two algebras is chiefly motivated 
by recent attempts to find out more about the still unknown symmetries 
underlying M-Theory. Following the discovery of a Kac-Moody billiard
and arithmetical chaos in superstring cosmology in \cite{DH}, a novel 
one-dimensional $\sigma$-model based on the formal coset ${E_{10}}/K({E_{10}})$ 
was proposed in \cite{DHN}, with $K({E_{10}})$ the maximal compact subgroup 
of ${E_{10}}$, and a precise identification was made in a BKL-type 
expansion between the bosonic supergravity fields at a given space 
point and their first spatial gradients on the one hand, and the 
first three levels of ${E_{10}}$ on the other (the emergence of ${E_{10}}$ 
in the dimensional reduction of $D\!=\!11$ supergravity\cite{CJS} 
to one dimension had been conjectured already long ago \cite{Julia}). 
An alternative proposal was made in \cite{West,West1}, where 
the rank-11 algebra $E_{11}$ is conjectured to be the fundamental 
symmetry of M-Theory. It is likewise based on a non-linear realization 
of the relevant ``Kac-Moody group'', but differs from \cite{DHN} in 
that it puts more emphasis on spacetime covariance. 

As in \cite{DHN} (as well as in \cite{OPR,CJLP,KNS,West,West1}) our 
investigation is based on a decomposition of these algebras 
w.r.t. to their maximal $sl(n,{\mathbb{R}})$ subalgebras, namely the two 
algebras $A_9 \equiv sl(10,{\mathbb{R}})$ and $A_{10} \equiv sl(11,{\mathbb{R}})$,
both of which can be enlarged to the Lie algebras of the full general 
linear groups $GL(10,{\mathbb{R}})$  and $GL(11,{\mathbb{R}})$ within ${E_{10}}$ and 
${E_{11}}$, respectively, by inclusion of the ``exceptional'' Cartan 
subalgebra generator. This decomposition is organized by means of 
the level $\ell$, which is the number of times a certain distinguished 
``exceptional'' root $\alpha_0$ appears in the decomposition of a 
given root $\alpha$ \cite{DHN}. The level-0 sectors then consist
of the $A_9$ and $A_{10}$ subalgebras themselves. For the first 
three levels, the representations which appear are of the same type for 
all $E_n$ with $n\geq 9$. Namely, the relevant Lie algebra generators are 
$E^{a_1 a_2 a_3}, E^{a_1 \dots a_6}$ and $E^{a_0|a_1 \dots a_8}$
(with the constraint $E^{[a_0|a_1 \dots a_8]}=0$). The associated 
Dynkin labels are 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{123}
\ell = 1 \;\; &:& \quad (001000000\dots) \nonumber\\
\ell = 2 \;\; &:& \quad (000001000\dots) \nonumber\\
\ell = 3 \;\; &:& \quad (100000010\dots) 
\end{eqnarray}
corresponding to the antisymmetric tensors with three and six indices
for $\ell=1,2$, respectively, and a mixed Young tableau for $\ell=3$;
in the physical interpretation, the first two are associated with the
electric and magnetic excitations of the 3-form field of maximal
$D\!=\!11$ supergravity, while the third can be viewed as dual 
to the graviton \cite{OPR,CJLP,Hull,West,DHN}. For the finite dimensional
Lie algebras $E_n$ with $n\leq 8$, there are no higher level 
representations beyond $\ell =3$; in particular, for $n=8$, the 
level-3 representation collapses to the $(1000000)$ of $A_7$, and for 
$E_7$ and $E_6$ it is absent altogether. For $n\geq 9$, there are
representations at all levels. While these are easy to classify for $E_9$,
a veritable explosion in the number of representations takes place
for $n\geq 10$, and this will be our main focus here. For the 
hyperbolic algebra ${E_{10}}$, we will obtain the complete list of 
$A_9$ representations up to level 18; for ${E_{11}}$, we give them up 
to level 10. In principle, these lists can be extended considerably 
further\footnote{Actually, the tables are now available up to 
level $\ell =28$ for ${E_{10}}$, where we have already 3276 inequivalent
irreducible representations of $SL(10,{\mathbb{R}})$ with maximum outer
multiplicity equal to 46450629 for the representation $(110100011)$. 
Evident lack of space prevents us from presenting the complete 
results here.}.

There is by now a substantial body of work on root multiplicities
of low rank hyperbolic KM algebras, and the corresponding decompositions
of these algebras w.r.t. to certain distinguished affine subalgebras,
starting with the rank 3 hyperbolic algebra studied \cite{FF} where 
closed formulas were derived for multiplicities of roots of affine 
level $\leq 2$. This work was extended up to affine level 5 
and to other low rank algebras in \cite{BKM1}-\cite{BKM3} and 
\cite{Ka1}-\cite{Ka5}, \cite{KaM1,KaM2}. A closed formula for the 
${E_{10}}$ root multiplicities at affine level two was derived 
in \cite{KMW} (affine levels zero and one being trivial).
The decomposition w.r.t. an affine subalgebra has the advantage of
classifying an infinite number of Lie algebra elements, but only 
``close to the lightcone'', and appears rather hopeless beyond the
very first levels. By contrast, the decomposition w.r.t. to a finite 
dimensional algebra yields only a finite amount of information at 
each step, but can be carried to rather high levels. 
Besides, it is of special interest for possible applications 
in string and M-Theory because it yields a concrete realization of 
the algebra in terms of irreducible representations of subgroups 
that have a direct physical interpretation. To penetrate the structure 
of ${E_{10}}$ even further one can try to ``intertwine'' the representation 
theory of $A_9$ and $E_9$, or to exploit the decomposition under its 
principal $sl(2,{\mathbb{R}})$ subalgebra \cite{Hu,NO}. As for ${E_{11}}$, and apart
from the $\ell\leq 3$ results of \cite{West,West1} (which do not require
knowledge of non-trivial ${E_{11}}$ root multiplicities), our results are
completely new; in particular, this is the first time that
non-trivial ${E_{11}}$ root multiplicities have been calculated.

While our methods are thus by no means sufficient to arrive at a completely 
explicit and manageable realization of these indefinite KM algebras, the 
results of this paper can nevertheless serve as useful ``raw data'' for 
future investigations. At the very least, they give a very concrete flavor 
of the stunning complexity of these mathematical structures: readers 
should keep in mind that the tables presented here represent only 
the very first steps into a structure, whose complexity will 
forever continue to grow with increasing level as one moves deeper 
and deeper into the lightcone. Even restricting attention to the 
low level representations exhibited here, the task of working out, 
say, the Lie algebra structure constants beyond the very first levels
seems too daunting even to contemplate. From the physics perspective,
the possible link noticed in \cite{DHN} between the three infinite 
towers of representations (\ref{n123}) and the spatial gradients
of the bosonic fields of $D\!=\!11$ supergravity is a tantalizing 
hint, but the task of finding a physical interpretation for all the 
other representations remains a major challenge. Realizing the full ${E_{10}}$
(or ${E_{11}}$) symmetry probably requires {\it a theory beyond} $D\!=\!11$ 
supergravity, as it seems very unlikely that these other representations 
simply correspond to auxiliary or St\""uckelberg-type degrees of freedom. 
For the time being, however, we must refer readers to the still unknown 
chapter in THE BOOK \cite{BOOK} for the answer to these and other questions!


\section{Roots and Dynkin labels}
The indefinite Kac Moody algebras $E_{10}$ and $E_{11}$ are 
characterized by the Dynkin diagrams displayed in figs.\ref{e10dynkin}
and  \ref{e11dynkin}. The simple roots of the respective $A_n$ 
subalgebras will be labeled $\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\dots$ (counting from 
left to right); the ``exceptional'' root connected to $\alpha_3$ will 
be designated by $\alpha_0$. Because both algebras are simply laced, 
the associated Cartan matrices are $A_{ij} = (\alpha_i | \alpha_j)$.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{e11-dynkin.eps}
\caption{\label{e11dynkin}$E_{11}$}
\end{figure}


As in \cite{DHN} we will decompose both algebras into irreducible
representations of their finite dimensional subalgebras $A_9$ and 
$A_{10}$, respectively. This corresponds to a slicing of the 
forward lightcone in the respective root lattices of ${E_{10}}$ and ${E_{11}}$
by spacelike hyperplanes; hence the sections will be ellipsoidal
with {\em finitely many roots in each slice}. By contrast, slicing
the lightcone by lightlike or timelike hyperplanes would result
in a decomposition w.r.t. an affine or an indefinite subalgebra, 
in both of which cases each slice contains {\em infinitely many roots}. 
As already mentioned the corresponding $SL(n+1,{\mathbb{R}})$ groups 
are enlarged to $GL(n+1,{\mathbb{R}})$, respectively, by inclusion of the
Cartan generator $h_0$ associated with the exceptional root.

For both algebras any positive root can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{root}
\alpha = \ell\alpha_0 + \sum_{j=1}^n m^j \alpha_j  
\end{equation}
with non-negative integers $\ell$ and $m^j$, and $n=9$ or $n=10$
for ${E_{10}}$ and ${E_{11}}$, respectively. The number $\ell$ is the ``level''
and counts the number of occurrences of the exceptional root $\alpha_0$ 
in $\alpha$. It must not be confused with the ``affine level'' ($=m^9$) 
used in the decomposition of $E_{10}$ w.r.t. its affine subalgebra 
$E_9$ \cite{FF,KMW}. There appears to be no useful analog of this
notion for $E_{11}$. 

The irreducible representations (or ``modules'' in more
mathematical language) of $A_9$ and $A_{10}$ are completely 
characterized their Dynkin labels, which are 9-tuples 
$(p_1 \dots p_9)$ and 10-tuples $(p_1 \dots p_{10})$
of non-negative integers, respectively, such that the 
corresponding highest weights $\lambda$ are given by
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \sum_{j=1}^n p_j \lambda^j
\end{equation}
for $n=9,10$. Here $\lambda^j$ are the fundamental weights of $A_n$  
obeying $(\alpha_i | \lambda^j) = \delta_i^j$ 
with $i,j=1,\dots,n$ for $n=9,10$, respectively. At the same time, 
$p_j$ is equal to the number of columns with $j$ vertical boxes 
in the associated Young tableau. The fundamental weights of $A_n$ 
are explicitly given by $\lambda^i = \sum_{j=1}^n S^{ij} \alpha_j$, where 
$S^{ij}$ is the inverse Cartan matrix of $A_n$ (see below). We use small 
Greek letters for the weights of $A_n$ to distinguish them from the weights 
of $E_{n+1}$, whose fundamental weights $\Lambda^j$ (for $j=0,1,\dots ,n$)
must in addition satisfy $(\alpha_0 | \Lambda^i) = \delta_0^i$
and  differ by a vector orthogonal to the simple roots of $A_n$, 
see below. The explicit relation between the coefficients $m^j$ 
and the Dynkin labels will be derived below.

Each root $\alpha$ comes with a certain root multiplicity ${{\rm mult}} (\alpha)$
counting the number of independent Lie algebra elements associated
with $\alpha$ \cite{Kac}. These Lie algebra elements will be split up according
to which representation of $A_9$ or $A_{10}$ they belong to. Any root 
$\alpha$ will therefore also appear as a weight in certain representations 
${\mathcal R}$, with corresponding weight multiplicities ${{\rm mult}}_{\mathcal R} (\alpha)$. 
Furthermore, any such representation can appear several times, and 
the number of times a representation occurs within a given level 
will be called the {\em outer multiplicity}; the outer multiplicity 
of an admissible representation (i.e. a representation satisfying 
the two conditions (\ref{mi}) and (\ref{La2}) below) may be zero. 
We thus have the following picture: the finitely many roots at a given 
level $\ell$ are superpositions of certain $A_n$ weight diagrams, each 
one of which may appear several times with a certain outer multiplicity. 

While the relevant representations that can appear are not hard to 
find, the determination of the outer multiplicities is a difficult and 
as yet unsolved problem. Knowing them in closed form would be equivalent
to a complete knowledge of the root multiplicities for indefinite and 
hyperbolic Kac Moody algebras (there is so far not a single example of 
such an algebra for which the root multiplicities are known in closed form)
and would take us a considerable way towards the ultimate goal of
finding an explicit and manageable realization of the full algebra.
All we know is that typically the root multiplicities increase 
exponentially as a function of their length $(-\alpha^2)$ \cite{Kac}, 
implying similar growth properties for the outer multiplicities.

In fact, the formulas restricting the possible representations
that can appear at level $\ell$ are easy to deduce \cite{DHN} and also 
easy to solve, especially with the help of a computer. To begin with, 
the representations which appear at level $\ell +1$ must be contained 
in the set of representations obtained by taking the product of the 
level one representation $(001000000)$ with all the representations
occurring at level $\ell$. This is because the level-$(\ell+1)$
generators are generally obtained by commuting the level-$\ell$ 
generators with a level one generator, and this is also how one
quickly derives the representations given in formula (\ref{123}).
However, many of the representations obtained in this way will drop
out, and the method becomes more and more impractical with higher levels. 

A better and much quicker way to derive the admissible representations
is by judicious analysis of the corresponding highest weights.
Indeed, the formula linking the  coefficients $m^j$ and the Dynkin 
labels of the relevant $A_9$ or $A_{10}$ is quite straightforward 
to deduce. First of all, we notice that the Chevalley generator $f_0$ 
is a highest weight state w.r.t. $A_9$ or $A_{10}$, with Dynkin label 
$(001000000\dots)$ because
\begin{eqnarray}
h_i (f_0) &\equiv& [h_i \, , f_0 ] = \delta_{i3} f_0 \nonumber\\
e_i (f_0) &\equiv& [e_i \, , f_0 ] = 0
\end{eqnarray}
for $i=1,\dots , n$. The associated highest weight is $\Lambda = - \alpha_0$.
Other highest weight states associated with roots 
$\Lambda\equiv - \alpha = -\alpha_{j_1} - \dots - \alpha_{j_k}$ are built from 
multiple commutators 
\begin{equation}
f_{j_1 \dots j_k} := [ f_{j_1} , \dots [f_{j_{k-1}},f_{j_k}]\dots ]
\end{equation}
by permuting the Chevalley generators $f_j$ in all possible ways
and taking suitable linear combinations
\begin{equation}
f^{(\Lambda)} = \sum c^{(\Lambda)}_{j_1 \dots j_k} f_{j_1 \dots j_k}
\end{equation}
which are annihilated by the adjoint action of all $e_i$ for
$i=1,\dots ,n$, i.e.
\begin{equation} 
e_i (f^{(\Lambda)}) \equiv [e_i , f^{(\Lambda)}] = 0
\end{equation}
The level of $f^{(\Lambda)}$ is the number of $j_\nu$ with $j_\nu = 0$.
The $A_n$ module is then built by acting on this state with the Chevalley
generators $f_i$, where again $i =1,\dots, n$. The weight of $f^{(\Lambda)}$ 
follows from
\begin{equation}\label{pi}
[h_i, f_{j_1 \dots j_k}] = \left( - \sum_{\nu=1}^k  A_{ij_\nu} \right) 
f_{j_1 \dots j_k}  = p_i f_{j_1 \dots j_k}
\end{equation}
An explicit basis of the module $V(\Lambda)$ is given in \cite{Verma}: all
states can be represented in the form
\begin{equation}
[f_{m_1},...,[f_{m_s}, f_{j_1 \dots j_k}]...] =
 f_{m_1 \dots m_s j_1 \dots j_k} \;\; , \quad m_\nu \in \{1,\dots ,n\}
\end{equation}
with weight labels
\begin{equation}
q_j = p_j - \sum_{\nu=1}^s A_{j m_\nu}
\end{equation}
where the $m_\nu$ are ordered according to the prescription given 
in \cite{Verma} (which is somewhat cumbersome to disentangle for
larger rank).

Setting 
$\alpha = \alpha_{j_1} + \dots + \alpha_{j_k} = \ell \alpha_0 + m^1 \alpha_1 + \dots + m^n \alpha_n$
and writing out the relation $p_i = - \sum_\nu A_{ij_\nu}$ we get 
(for $n=9,10$)
\begin{eqnarray}
p_1 &=& m_2 - 2m_1 \nonumber\\
p_2 &=& m_1 + m_3 - 2 m_2 \nonumber\\
p_3 &=& \ell + m_2 + m_4 - 2 m_3 \nonumber\\
p_4 &=& m_3 + m_5 - 2 m_4 \nonumber\\
&\cdot&\nonumber\\&\cdot&\nonumber\\&\cdot&\nonumber\\
p_{n-1} &=& m_{n-2} + m_n - 2 m_{n-1} \nonumber\\
p_n &=& m_{n-1} - 2 m_n
\end{eqnarray} 
Because this is a highest weight state by assumption, the corresponding
weight $\sum p_j \lambda^j$ is dominant, hence $p_j\geq 0$. Inverting this 
formula, we obtain \cite{DHN}
\begin{equation}\label{mi}
m^i = S^{i3} \ell - \sum_{j=1}^n S^{ij} p_j
\end{equation}
where $S^{ij}$ are the inverse Cartan matrices of $A_9$ and $A_{10}$,
respectively. This formula also allows us to express the highest
weight $\Lambda= -\alpha$ in terms of the $A_n$ weights: multiplying by
$\alpha_i$ and summing over $i$, we get
\begin{equation} 
\sum_{j=1}^n m^j \alpha_j = \ell \sum_{j=1}^n S^{3j} \alpha_j - 
                        \sum_{j=1}^n p_j \lambda^j
\end{equation}
where we have also used the definition of the fundamental $A_n$ weights.
Hence,
\begin{equation}
\Lambda \equiv - \alpha = -\ell \Big( \alpha_0 + \sum_{j=1}^n S^{3j} \alpha_j \Big) 
                  +  \sum_{j=1}^n p_j \lambda^j
\end{equation}
Observe that $p_j=(\alpha_j |\Lambda )= (\alpha_j |\lambda)$ for $j=1,\dots ,n$ because 
the first term has vanishing scalar product with these simple roots.

The inverse Cartan matrices are, respectively, given by
\begin{equation}
S^{ij}[A_9] = \frac1{10}
\left(\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
   9 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
   8 & 16 & 14 & 12 & 10 & 8 & 6 & 4 & 2 \\
   7 & 14 & 21 & 18 & 15 & 12 & 9 & 6 & 3 \\
   6 & 12 & 18 & 24 & 20 & 16 & 12 & 8 & 4 \\
   5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 20 & 15 & 10 & 5 \\
   4 & 8 & 12 & 16 & 20 & 24 & 18 & 12 & 6 \\
   3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 & 18 & 21 & 14 & 7 \\
   2 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 14 & 16 & 8 \\
   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
for $A_9$ and
\begin{equation}
S^{ij} [A_{10}]= \frac1{11}
\left(\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
   10 & 9 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
   9 & 18 & 16 & 14 & 12 & 10 & 8 & 6 & 4 & 2 \\
   8 & 16 & 24 & 21 & 18 & 15 & 12 & 9 & 6 & 3 \\
   7 & 14 & 21 & 28 & 24 & 20 & 16 & 12 & 8 & 4 \\
   6 & 12 & 18 & 24 & 30 & 25 & 20 & 15 & 10 & 5 \\
   5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 30 & 24 & 18 & 12 & 6 \\
   4 & 8 & 12 & 16 & 20 & 24 & 28 & 21 & 14 & 7 \\
   3 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 15 & 18 & 21 & 24 & 16 & 8 \\
   2 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 14 & 16 & 18 & 9 \\
   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
for $A_{10}$. Because the entries of $S^{ij}$ are all positive, and 
because $m^i$ and $p_i$ must all be non-negative integers, the formula
(\ref{mi}) strongly constrains the possible representations for each $\ell$.

A further constraint derives from the fact that the highest weight
$\Lambda = -\alpha$ must be a root; this means that its norm must obey 
$\Lambda^2\leq 2$ \footnote{This is only a necessary but not a sufficient 
criterion for $\Lambda$ to be a root, see our discussion of the ${E_{11}}$
roots in the next section.}.This requirement effectively implements 
the Serre relations. For $E_{10}$ it implies
\begin{equation}\label{La2}
\Lambda^2 = \alpha^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^9 p_i S^{ij} p_j - "
