The most general parallelizable pp-wave backgrounds which are non-dilatonic
solutions in the NS-NS sector of type IIA and IIB string theories are
considered.
We demonstrate that parallelizable pp-wave backgrounds are necessarily
homogeneous plane-waves, and that a large class of homogeneous plane-waves
are parallelizable, stating the necessary conditions.
Such plane-waves can be classified according to the number
of preserved supersymmetries. In type IIA, these include 
backgrounds
preserving 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 supercharges, while in the IIB case they 
preserve
16, 20, 24 or 28 supercharges. An intriguing property of parallelizable pp-wave
backgrounds is that the bosonic part of these solutions are invariant 
under T-duality, while the number of supercharges might change under 
T-duality. Due to their
$\alpha^\prime$ exactness, they provide interesting backgrounds for
studying string theory. Quantization of string modes, their 
compactification and behaviour under T-duality are studied.
In addition, we consider BPS $Dp$-branes, and show that 
these $Dp$-branes can be classified in terms of the locations
of their world volumes with respect to 
the background $H$-field.
