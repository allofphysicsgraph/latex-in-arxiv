\item For steep positive potentials $(V>0, \lambda ^2>12)$,
 only a circle $S$ exists, some kinetic-dominated
 scaling solutions of which are the late-time attrators.
\item For intermediate positive potentials $(V>0, 6<\lambda ^2<12)$,
 a circle $S$ and a fixed point $B$ exist. There exist no stable
 points.
\item For flat positive potentials $(V>0, \lambda ^2<6)$, all
 critical points exist. The double-kinetic -potential scaling
 solution is the unique late-time attractor.
\item For steep
 negative potentials $(V<0, \lambda ^2>12)$, all critical points
 exist. some kinetic-dominated scaling solutions of which are the
 late-time attrators.
\item For intermediate negative potentials $(V<0, 6<\lambda ^2<12)$,
 a circle $S$ and two fixed point $A$ exist.
 There exist no stable points.
\item For flat negative potentials $(V<0, \lambda ^2<6)$,
 only a circle $S$ exists, which are never stable.
