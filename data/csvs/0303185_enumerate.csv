        \item{}There are apparent violations of the GZK bound
        observed in ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) detected
        by the AGASA experiment\cite{AGASA}. The experimental situation is
        inconsistent, but the new AUGER cosmic ray detector, which
        is now operational, is expected to resolve the situation
        over the next year or two. If there is a violation of the
        GZK bound, a possible explanation is Planck scale physics
        coming from (\ref{modified}) \cite{AC-Piron}.  
	
	In Scenario A) violations of
	the GZK bounds can be explained by either $E^{3}$ or
	$E^{4}$ terms in the proton energy-momentum relation.
	However, in case B) it is less natural
	to explain a
	violation of the GZK bounds by means of a Planck scale
	modification of the energy-momentum relations, but there
	are proposals for forms of such theories that do achieve this. 

       \item{}A similar anomaly is possibly indicated in Tev
       photons coming from blazers\cite{blazers}.  Similar remarks
       apply as to the explanatory power of Scenarios A) and B) in the 
       event that the anomaly exists. 

        \item{}A consequence of (\ref{modified}) is an energy
        dependent speed of light. This effect can be looked for in
        timing data of gamma ray busts. Present data bounds
        $\alpha < \approx 10^4$ \cite{wavelets} 
	and data expected  from the GLAST
        experiment is expected to be sensitive to $\alpha$ of
        order one in 2006 \cite{glast}. Note that this applies to both
	Scenarios A) and B). 

        \item{}Present observations of synchrotron radiation in the 
	Crab nebula, together with reasonable astrophysical assumptions,
	put {\it very strong} (of order $10^{-9}$!!)
        bounds on $\alpha$ for photons and electrons, in the case
        of Scenario A only\cite{synch}.

        \item{}Present data from precision nuclear and atomic
        physics experiments puts very tight bounds on $\alpha$ for
        photons, electrons and hadrons, again in Scenario A),
        only\cite{atomic}.

        effects puts interesting bounds on $\alpha$ in the case of
        Scenario A) \cite{seth}.

        distant galaxies puts tight
        bounds on a possible helicity dependent $\alpha$  
        \cite{helicity}.

        \item{}Observations of phase coherence in stellar and 
	galactic interferometry
        is expected, given certain assumptions\footnote{See \cite{ng} 
        for discussion of them.}, 
	to put order one bounds on $\alpha$ in the 
	near future \cite{interference}.

        \item{}Certain hypotheses about the Planck scale lead to
        the prediction of noise in gravitational wave detectors
        that may be observable at LIGO and VIRGO\cite{wave}.

        \item{}Under some cosmological scenarios, modifications of
        the form of (\ref{modified}) lead to distortions of the
        CMB spectrum that may be observable in near future
        observations\cite{CMB-distort}.

\item{}Evidence for or against supersymmetry may be detected at the Tev scale

\"
6,"\begin{enumerate}

  \item{}The states of the theory are known
precisely.
  The Hilbert space ${\cal H}^{diffeo}$ 
  of spatially diffeomorphism invariant states 
  of general relativity in
 $3+1$ dimensions has an orthonormal basis, whose elements 
 are in one to one correspondence
  with the diffeomorphism equivalence classes of embeddings of
  certain labeled graphs, called spin networks\cite{sn-roger},
  into $\Sigma$ \cite{sn1}.

  A labeled graph is a graph whose edges and vertices have attached
to them elements of a certain set of labels. In the case of pure
  general relativity with vanishing cosmological constant, the labels
  on the edges are given by ordinary $SU(2)$ spins. There are
  also labels on
  nodes of the spin networks, which are invariants or intertwiners
  from the representation theory of $SU(2)$. For details
  see \cite{sn-roger,sn1}..

  \item{}Certain spatially diffeomorphism invariant 
  observables have been constructed. After a
  suitable regularization procedure these turn out to be
  represented by {\it finite} operators on ${\cal H}^{diffeo}$, the space
  of spin network states\cite{spain,volume,volume2}.
  These include the volume of the universe,
  the area of the boundary of the universe, or of any surface defined
  by the values of matter fields.   Other operators also have
  been constructed, for example an operator that measures
  angles in the quantum geometry\cite{seth-angles}.
  These operators all preserve the diffeomorphism
  invariance of the states\cite{diffeo}.
  
  
  \item{}The area and volume operators have discrete, finite
  spectra, valued in terms of the Planck length\cite{volume,volume2}.
  There is hence a
  smallest possible volume and  a smallest possible area,
  of order of the Planck volume
and area.  The spectra have been computed in closed form.

\item{}The area and volume operators can be promoted to genuine
physical observables, by gauge fixing the time gauge so that at least
locally time is measured by a physical field\cite{me-maryland,diffeo}.  
The discrete
spectra remain for such physical observables, hence the spectra of
area and volume constitute genuine physical predictions of the quantum
theory of gravity.


\item{}Due to the existence of minimal physical volumes and areas, the
 theory has no excitations that correspond to gravitons or matter
 degrees of freedom with wavelengths shorter than the Planck
 length\cite{weaves,thomas-thesis}.

  \item{}Among the operators that have been constructed and found to
  be finite on ${\cal H}^{diffeo}$ 
  is the Hamiltonian constraint (or, as it is often called,
  the {\it Wheeler de Witt} equation\cite{ham}-\cite{thomas-ham}.)
  Not only can the Wheeler
  deWitt equation then be precisely defined, it can be solved exactly.
  Several infinite sets of solutions
  have been constructed, as certain superpositions of the spin
  network basis states, for all values of the cosmological
  constant\cite{loop1,thomas}.
  These are exact, physical states of quantum general relativity.

  If one fixes a physical
  time coordinate, in terms of the values of some physical fields,
  one can also define the Hamiltonian for evolution in that physical
  time coordinate\cite{me-maryland} and it is also given by a finite
  operator on a suitable extension of ${\cal H}^{diffeo}$ including
  matter fields. 

  \item{}The dynamics of the spin network states can be expressed
  also in a path integral formalism, called
  spin foams\cite{mike-foam}-\cite{foamreviews}\footnote{For the most 
  recent review see \cite{alejandro-review}.}.
  The histories by which spin network
  states evolve to other spin network states, called spin foam
  histories,  are explicitly known.
  A spin foam history is a labeled combinatorial
  structures, which can be described as a branched labeled two complex.
Spin foam models have
  been derived in  several different ways, and the results
  agree as to the general form of a spin foam amplitude. These
include: 1) by exponentiation of the Hamiltonian
  constraint, 2) directly from a discrete approximation
  to the classical spacetime theory, 3)  by constraining the
  summations in a finite state sum formulation of a four dimensional
  topological invariant, 4) from a matrix model on the space of
  fields over the group, 5) by postulating spacetime events are local
  moves in spin networks.

   Evolution amplitudes corresponding to the
   quantization of the Einstein equations in $3+1$ dimensions,
   are known precisely\cite{alejandro-review}
   for vanishing and non-vanishing values of the cosmological
   constant, and for both the Euclidean and Lorentzian theories.


  The sum over spin foams has two parts, a sum over graphs
  representing histories of spin networks, and, on each, a sum
  over the labels.  The sums over labels are known from both analytic
  and numerical results to be
  convergent\cite{finite-foam,finite-dan} for some spin foam
  models, including some corresponding to the quantization of
  the Einstein equations in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions.

 For some spin foam model in $2+1$ dimensions, it has been shown that
 the sum over spin foam histories is Borel
  summable\cite{laurent-borel}.


  The physical inner product, which is the inner product on solutions
  to all the constraints, has an exact expression, given in terms
  of spin foam models\cite{RR-foam}.
  
  
  \item{}Matter may be added at to both the hamiltonian and spin foam
  formulations. For the hamiltonian theory it is known how to extend
  the definition of the spatially diffeomorphism invariant states to
  include all the standard kinds of matter fields, including gauge 
  fields, spinors, scalars and Kalb-Ramond fields. 
  These states are also invariant under ordinary Yang-Mills and
  Kalb-Ramond gauge transformations. 
  The forms for the
  matter field terms in the hamiltonian constraints are known 
  precisely. The spin foam models have been extended to include
  gauge and spinor degrees of freedom\footnote{To my knowledge whether 
  loop quantum gravity suffers from the fermion doubling problem is
  an open question.}.  Inclusion of matter fields does not
  affect the finiteness and discreteness of the area and volume
  observables. 
  
  \item{}Spin
  foam models appropriate for Lorentzian quantum gravity, called
  causal spin foams, have quantum analogues of all the basic features
  of general relativistic spacetimes\footnote{For more details on these
  models and the resulting physical picture, see\cite{Fotini-Wheeler}.}. 
  These include
  dynamically generated
  causal structure, light cones and a discrete analogue of
  multifingered time, which is the freedom to slice the spacetime
  many different ways into
  sequences of spatial slices\cite{F-foam}.
  The spatial slices are spin networks,
  which are quantum analogues of spatial geometries.

  \item{}Several kinds of boundaries may be incorporated in the
  theory including timelike boundaries, in the presence of both
  positive and negative cosmological constant, and null boundaries
  such as black hole and cosmological
  horizons\cite{linking}-\cite{me-holo}.
  In all these cases
  the boundary states and observables are understood in terms of
  structures derived from Chern-Simons theory.

  \item{}The boundary Hilbert spaces decompose into eigenspaces, one
  for each eigenvalue of the operator that measures the area of the
  boundary\cite{linking}.
  For each area eigenvalue, the Hilbert space is finite
  dimensional. The entropy may be computed and it agrees precisely
  with the Beckenstein-Hawking semiclassical result,
\begin{equation}
S = {A[S] \over 4 \hbar G_{Newton}}
\label{bb}
\end{equation}

 Among the boundaries that can be studied are horizons.  The boundary
 theory then provides a detailed microscopic description of the
 physics at the boundary. Furthermore, the prediction of Bekenstein
 and Hawking that an horizon should have the entropy (\ref{bb})
 is completely explained in terms of the
  statistical mechanics of the state spaces associated with the
  degrees of freedom on the horizon. This has been found
  to work for a large class of black holes, including Schwarzschild
  black holes\cite{kirill1,isolated}.

  The calculation of the entropy involves a parameter,
  which is called the Imirzi parameter. This can be understood
  either as a free parameter that labels a one dimensional family
  of spin network representations, or as the (finite) ratio of the
  bare to renormalized Newton's constant. The Imirzi parameter is
  fixed precisely by an argument invented by Dreyer, involving
  quasi normal modes of black holes\cite{dreyer}. Dreyer's argument depends
  on a remarkable precise
  coincidence between an asymptotic value
  of the quasi normal mode frequency and a number which appears in
  the loop quantum gravity description of horizons. The value of
  the asymptotic quasi normal mode frequency was at first known
  only numerically, but it has been very recently derived
  analytically by Motl\cite{motl}.  Once Dreyer's argument fixes the
  Imirzi parameter, the Bekenstein-Hawking relation (\ref{bb}) is
  predicted exactly for all black hole and cosmological
  horizons\footnote{Dreyer's calculation leads also to the conclusion that
  transitions where punctures, i.e. ends of spin networks, 
  are added or subtracted to the boundary, must be dominated by
  creation and annihilation of spin $1$ punctures.}.

  \item{}Corrections to the Bekenstein entropy have been calculated and
found to be logarithmic\cite{logcorrect}.

  \item{}Suitable approximate calculations reproduce the Hawking
  predict a discrete fine structure in the
  Hawking spectrum\cite{kirill-radiate,fineBH}. At the same time,
  the spectrum fills in and becomes continuous in the limit of
  infinite black hole mass. 
  This fine structure stands as another definitive
  physical prediction of the theory.  

  Thus, to summarize, loop quantum gravity leads to a
  detailed microscopic picture of the quantum geometry of a black hole
  or cosmological horizon\cite{isolated}. This picture reproduces
  completely and  explains the results
  on the
  thermodynamic and
  quantum properties of horizons from the work of
  Bekenstein\cite{bek1}, Hawking\cite{hawking} and Unruh\cite{unruh}.
  This picture is completely general and applies to all black hole
  and cosmological horizons.

  \item{}For the case of non-vanishing cosmological constant, of
  either sign, there is an exact physical state, called the Kodama 
  state, which is
  an exact solution to all of the quantum constraint equations, whose
  semiclassical limit exists\cite{kodama}.
  That limit describes deSitter or
  anti-deSitter spacetime.  Solutions obtained by perturbing around
  this state, in both gravitational\cite{positive}
  and matter fields\cite{chopinlee}, reproduce, at
  long wavelength, quantum field theory in curved spacetime and the
  quantum theory of long wave length, free gravitational waves on
  deSitter or anti-deSitter spacetime\footnote{For a possible
  $\Lambda=0$ analogue of the Kodama state, see \cite{mikovic}.}.

  \item{}The inverse cosmological constant turns out to be quantized
  in integral units, so that $k= 6 \pi / G \Lambda$ is an
  integer\cite{linking}.

  \item{}The thermal nature of quantum field theory in a deSitter
  spacetime is explained in terms of a periodicity in the
  configuration space of the exact quantum theory of general
  relativity\cite{positive}.

  \item{}A large class of states are known which have course grained
  descriptions which reproduce the geometry of flat
  space, or any slowly varying metric\cite{weaves,newweaves}.
  Linearizing the quantum
  theory around these states yields linearized quantum gravity, for
  gravitons with wavelength long compared to the Planck
  length\cite{graviton-weave}.  It is also understood how to
  construct coherent states which are peaked around classical
  configurations\cite{coherent}.

 
  \item{}A reduction of the exact physical state space to states
which
  are spatially homogeneous is known, and the reduction of the
dynamics
  to this subspace of states is known\cite{LQC}.
  (This is different from the
  usual quantum cosmology in that the reduction to homogeneous states
  is done in the Hilbert space of the full theory, rather than before
  quantization.)  The evolution of these states has been studied in
  detail and it has been found generically that the usual FRW
  cosmology is reproduced when the universe is very large in Planck
  units. At the same time the cosmological singularities are removed,
  and replaced by bounces where the universe re-expands (or
  pre-contracts).  When couplings to a scalar field are included,
  there is a natural mechanism which generates Planck scale inflation
  as well as a graceful exit from it\cite{LQC}.

  \item{}Many of these results extend to quantum supergravity for $N=1$
  and several have been studied also for $N=2$\cite{super}.

  \item{}The same methods can
  also be used to solve quantum gravity in $2+1$ dimensions\cite{2+1}
  and in
  many $1+1$ dimensional reductions of the theory\cite{1+1}.
  They also work to
  solve a large class of topological field theories\cite{tft,BF},
  giving results
  equivalent to those achieved by other methods. Further, loop
  methods applied to lattice gauge theories yields results equivalent
  to those achieved by other methods\cite{latticeloop}.
  
   \item{}In both flat space and around deSitter spacetime, one may
  extend the calculations that reproduce quantum theory for
  long wavelength gravitons and matter fields to higher energies.
 These calculations reveal the
  presence of corrections to the energy-momentum relations of the
  form of (\ref{modified}). However, now the parameters
 $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are computable constants, that depend on
  the ground state wavefunctional\cite{GP,AMU,positive}.
  These represent further predictions of the theory.  


  \item{}Many of these results have been checked by being derived by
  several
  different methods, involving different regularization procedures.
  Some of these employ a high energy physics level of rigor, while
  other methods are fully rigorous, at the level of mathematical
  quantum field theory\cite{gangof5,thomas,thomas-thesis}.
  All the key results have been verified by
  being rederived with completely rigorous methods.

7,"\begin{enumerate}

  \item{}Perturbative string theories are known, which are consistent
  through second non-trivial order in string perturbation
  theory\footnote{String perturbation theory is defined as an expansion
  in the genus of the topology of the two dimensional world surface
  of the string. Leading order is a sphere, first leading order is a
  torus, etc.}\cite{GSW,Joe}.
  These include five supersymmetric string theories which are
  defined in $10$ dimensional
  Minkowski spacetime.

  The one loop consistency is well
  understood\cite{GSW,Joe}, while the two loop consistency has
  only been proved recently\cite{DP}.   Beyond two loops, there are
  partial results\cite{pasttwoloops} which support the conjecture that
  the theory is consistent to all orders.  There are intuitive
  arguments that suggest that ultraviolet divergences of the kind
  that plague conventional quantum field theory cannot occur in
  string theory.  The main reason is that the interactions of strings
  involve the breaking and joining of strings and these do not take
  place at points.  However, a string theory can fail to be
  consistent for other reasons.  There may be infrared divergences, or
  ambiguities in the definition of the amplitudes, there can be
  anomalies in the action of the lorentz boosts,  or the theory may
  fail to be unitary.  The problem of the
  consistency of perturbative string theory appears to be very
  challenging, and the proof of consistency at two loops required a
  very impressive technical {\it tour de force\cite{DP}.}

  As it does not appear to be widely appreciated that the consistency
  of string perturbation theory is still open\footnote{Among other 
  claims that apparently did not stand up, a paper of
  Mandelstam\cite{mandelstam} is sometimes cited. However, the 
  opinion of experts familar with the technical issues involved
  appears to be that this paper does not contain a
  satisfactory or complete  proof of finiteness and 
  uniqueness of superstring amplitudes to all orders. For a discussion 
  of some of the technical issues involved, see \cite{marshakov} and
  \cite{kaku}, who says in part, (p 226) 
{\it `` Being able to isolate the singularities... is a great
step towards solving the main problem facing string perturbation 
theory, i.e. rigorously proving finiteness to all orders... However, 
there are many delicate points related to the question of the 
cancelation of these diverges that have not been totally solved.
Although preliminary results are encouraging, the rigorous proof of the
cancelation of divergencees is still an outstanding problem''}.}, 
I quote here from
  a recent paper by experts in the field, which announced the proof of
  consistency at the two loop level.

  \begin{quote}
      Despite great advances in superstring theory, multiloop amplitudes
      are still unavailable,
almost twenty years after the derivation of the one-loop amplitudes by
Green and Schwarz
for Type II strings and by Gross et al. for heterotic strings.
The main obstacle is
the presence of supermoduli for worldsheets of non-trivial topology. 
Considerable
efforts had been made by many authors in order to overcome this 
obstacle, and a chaotic
situation ensued, with many competing prescriptions proposed in 
the literature. These
prescriptions drew from a variety of fundamental principles such 
as BRST invariance and
the picture-changing formalism, descent equations and Cech cohomology, modular
invariance, the light-cone gauge, the global geometry of the Teichmueller curve,
the unitary gauge, the operator formalism, group theoretic methods,
factorization, and algebraic supergeometry. However, the basic problem was that
gauge-fixing required a local gauge slice, and the prescriptions ended 
up depending on the
choice of such slices, violating gauge invariance. At the most 
pessimistic end, this raised
the undesirable possibility that superstring amplitudes could be ambiguous, 
and that it
may be necessary to consider other options, such as the Fischler-Susskind
mechanism\cite{DP}.
  \end{quote}

  This situation is  a bit disappointing, given that the main claim
  for string theory as a quantum theory of gravity is that it alone
  gives a consistent perturbation theory containing gravitons. After
  all, supergravity theories, which are ordinary field theories which
  extend general relativity to incorporate supersymmetry, are also
  consistent in perturbation theory at least to the two loop
  level and $N=8$ supergravity in four dimensions is expected
  to be consistent at least to five loops\cite{sugra2loop}.  The difference is
  that there are reasons
  to expect that supergravity theories become inconsistent at
  some point beyond two loops,
  while no reason is known that the technical
  difficulties that have blocked a proof of the consistency of 
  perturbative string theory
  cannot someday be overcome.

  It is further known that bosonic string perturbation theory is not Borel
resumable and this is conjectured to extend to superstring 
theory\cite{notborel}. This means that the theory cannot be
  defined completely
  by perturbation theory because there may be excitations of the full
  theory that are not captured in the perturbation theory.
  
  From now on, when I label a string theory ``consistent'' I really 
  mean that it is known to be consistent to one or two loop order, 
  and that no reason is known why the conjecture of all orders 
  consistency may not apply to it.
  

  
  \item{}There are consistent string theories with spatially closed
  boundary conditions (so the string is a closed loop)
  and with open boundary conditions.
  The latter, called
  open string theories have spectra that include
  the quanta of Yang Mills fields\cite{GSW,Joe}. The
  Yang Mills coupling $g_{YM}$
  is related to the string coupling by $g_{YM}^2 =
  g_{string}$\footnote{In four dimensions where the Yang-Mills coupling
  is dimensionless.}.

 \item{}Consistent closed string theories have spectra that include
 massless gravitons propagating on the background\cite{GSW,Joe}.
 They couple with a
 Newton's constant given by\footnote{Again, in $d=4$.}
 $G_{Newton}= g_{string} l_{string}^2$.


 \item{}All string theories which are known to be consistent to
 second order are
supersymmetric. There are some non-supersymmetric string theories
which appear to be consistent at least to first non-trivial order.
While not supersymmetric, these  have spectra in which
fermions and bosons are grouped in pairs of equal mass\cite{nonsuper}.
As this is not a feature of our world, if
string theory is true it must be that supersymmetry (or at least
fermi-boson matching) is spontaneously broken.

 \item{}Many known consistent string theories have backgrounds
 that are $10$ dimensional manifolds, or  can be understood
 as arising from $10$ dimensional manifolds by compactifications and
 identifications\cite{GSW,Joe}.
 A simple class of example of such consistent compactified
 backgrounds are those cases in which
 the compactified $d$ dimensional manifold is a $d$-torus.

 \item{}A necessary\footnote{There is a variant of string theory,
 called non-critical string theory \cite{NCS}, in which the conformal
 anomaly does not vanish perturbatively, but it is claimed, under
 certain conditions, it may vanish as a consequence of a 
 non-perturbative regularization scheme. The literature on this
 subject describes some interesting ideas, however I do not understand
 the status of the claims made well enough to include them in this
 review. } condition for a
 perturbative string theories to
 be consistent is that the two dimensional world sheet quantum
 field theory that defines the theory be
 conformally invariant\cite{GSW,Joe,CFTstrings}. This
 means that the  conformal anomaly on the two dimensional
 worldsheet vanishes.  To leading order in $l_{string}$ this
 condition is equivalent to the Einstein equations of the
 background manifold\footnote{Corrections to the background
 field equations have been worked out.}.

 \item{}There are a very large number, perhaps infinite, of
 backgrounds of the form of four dimensional flat spacetime producted
 with a six dimensional compact manifold.  A large class exists where
 the six dimensional compact manifold is a Calabi-Yau manifold. There
 are estimated to be on the order of at least $10^{5}$ distinct
 such manifolds.

 \item{}Most of the known backgrounds of the form of
 $Mink^{10-d} \times Compact^{d}$ have
parameters  that measure the
 geometry of the compactified manifold, in many cases these parameters
 can vary over the $10-d$ dimensional manifold and hence become scalar
 fields, called moduli fields, on the $10-d$ dimensional manifold.
In many cases the energy does not depend on the values of the moduli
parameters, so the fields that represent them on
$Mink^{10-d}$ are massless.

No consistent string theories are known that have no massless
scalar fields. 

\item{}These include the case $10-d=4$, which is so far at least
supported by all observations, but consistent backgrounds
exist for any $d$ up to $9$.

\item{}There are transitions in string theory in which the
topology of the $d$ dimensional compact manifold
changes\cite{phasechange}.

\item{}There are consistent string backgrounds for $4$ large,
uncompactified dimensions that correspond to a large range of
possible values for the number of generations,  for
the number of Higgs fields and for the gauge group. Thus, string theory
makes no prediction for these characteristics of the standard
model\cite{varietyofstrings}. (See figure 1.)

 \item{}There are so far not known any consistent, stable, 
 string backgrounds
 of the form of DeSitter spacetimes times a compact
 manifold\cite{stringcosmoproblem,andyds}\footnote{The reason is
 related to the fact that there is no unitary representation of the
 supersymmetric extension of the symmetry group of deSitter spacetime.
 There have been intriguing suggestions from string theorists
 about
 quantum gravity with a positive cosmological constant, a few of them
 involve string theory explicitly. However Ed Witten recently wrote,
``In fact, classical or not, I don't know any clear-cut way
to get de Sitter space from
string theory or M-theory. This last statement is not very surprising
given the classical no go theorem. For, in view of the usual problems
in stabilizing moduli, it is hard to
get de Sitter space in a reliable fashion at the quantum level given
that it does not arise
classically\cite{stringcosmoproblem}.''}.

\item{}More generally all known consistent, stable string theories
have time-like or null 
killing fields. No consistent stable string backgrounds 
are known which are time dependent\footnote{This limitation is tied to 
supersymmetry, because the closure of even the $N=1$ supersymmetry
algebra contains the hamiltonian, and that is only well defined on
backgrounds that possess a timelike or null killing field.}. 

 \item{}There are an infinite number of consistent backgrounds that
include
 structures known as $D$-branes\cite{Joe}.
 These are submanifolds of various
 dimensions embedded in the background on which open strings may end.
 These branes may be charged, with respect to some of the generalized
 electric and magnetic fields. The $D$-branes have dynamics induced
by their coupling to the strings and charges. This includes Yang-Mills
 fields which propagate on the branes\cite{joe-branes,branes-review}.

  \item{}By a careful choice of arrangements of several branes,
 intersecting at carefully chosen angles, one can construct a string
 theory background whose low energy limit has some features of the
 supersymmetric
 standard model, including chiral fermions and parity violating gauge
 couplings\cite{mostreal}.  However, many other consistent backgrounds
 exist which
 do not have these features\cite{varietyofstrings}.

 \item{}For certain compactifications, with $d=3,4$ or $5$ flat directions,
 and in the limit of vanishing $g_{string}$, and hence
 $G_{Newton}$,
 there are $BPS$ states of string theory including $D$-branes,
 which have the same mass,
 charges and angular momenta of an extremal black hole in $d$
 dimensions. The number of such states is in all cases exactly equal
to the
 exponential of the Bekenstein entropy of the corresponding black
hole\cite{SV,otherbh,nearextremal}.

 \item{}If one perturbs away from the $BPS$ condition for the string
 theory states, to a near extremal condition, and constructs a
thermal
 ensemble, the spectrum of the Hawking radiation from the
 corresponding near extremal black hole is reproduced exactly,
 including the grey body factors\cite{nearextremal}.
