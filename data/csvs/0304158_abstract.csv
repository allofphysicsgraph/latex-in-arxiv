The infinite matrices in Witten's vertex are
easy to diagonalize. It just requires some
$SL(2,\Rh)$ lore plus a Watson-Sommerfeld transformation.
We calculate the eigenvalues of all Neumann matrices
for all scale dimensions $s$,
both for matter and ghosts, including fractional $s$
which we use to
regulate the difficult $s=0$ limit. We find that
$s=1$ eigenfunctions just acquire a $p$ term,
and $x$ gets replaced by the midpoint position.
