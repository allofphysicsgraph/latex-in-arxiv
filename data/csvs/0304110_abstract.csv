The fermion propagators in the fivebrane background
 of type II superstring theories are calculated.
The propagator can be obtained
 by explicitly evaluating the transition amplitude
 between two specific NS-R boundary states by the propagator operator
 in the non-trivial world-sheet conformal field theory
 for the fivebrane background.
The propagator in the field theory limit
 can be obtained by using point boundary states.
We can explicitly investigate
 the lowest lying fermion states
 propagating in the non-trivial ten-dimensional space-time
 of the fivebrane background:
 $M^6 \times W_k^{(4)}$,
 where $W_k^{(4)}$ is the group manifold of SU$(2)_k \times$U$(1)$.
The half of the original supersymmetry is spontaneously broken,
 and the space-time Lorentz symmetry SO$(9,1)$ reduces to
 SO$(5,1)$ in SO$(5,1) \times$SO$(4) \subset$ SO$(9,1)$
 by the fivebrane background.
We find that there are no propagations
 of SO$(4)$ (local Lorentz) spinor fields,
 which is consistent with the arguments
 on the fermion zero-modes in the fivebrane background
 of low-energy type II supergravity theories.
