\noindent All purely bosonic supersymmetric solutions of
minimal gauged supergravity in five dimensions are classified.
The solutions fall into two classes depending on whether
the Killing vector constructed from the Killing spinor is
time-like or null. When it is timelike, the solutions
are determined by a four-dimensional K\""ahler base-manifold,
up to an anti-holomorphic function, and generically preserve
1/2 of the supersymmetry. When it is null we provide a precise
prescription for constructing the solutions
and we show that they generically preserve 1/4
of the supersymmetry.  We show that $AdS_5$ is the unique
maximally supersymmetric configuration.
The formalism is used to construct some new solutions,
including a non-singular deformation of $AdS_5$,
which can be uplifted to obtain new solutions of type IIB supergravity.
