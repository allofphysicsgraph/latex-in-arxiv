A special class of mixed-symmetry type tensor gauge fields of degrees two
and three in four dimensions is investigated from the perspective of the
Lagrangian deformation procedure based on cohomological BRST techniques. It
is shown that the deformed solution to the master equation can be taken to
be nonvanishing only at the first order in the coupling constant. As a
consequence, we deduce an interacting model with deformed gauge
transformations, an open gauge algebra and undeformed reducibility
functions. The resulting coupled Lagrangian action contains a quartic vertex
and some ``mass'' terms involving only the tensor of degree two. We discuss
in what sense the results of the deformation procedure derived here are
complementary to recent others.
