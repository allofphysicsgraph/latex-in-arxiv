Using functional derivatives with respect to the free correlation function we derive a closed set of
Schwinger-Dyson equations in $\phi^4$-theory. Its conversion to graphical recursion relations allows us to
systematically generate all connected and one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams for the two- and four-point
function together with their weights.
