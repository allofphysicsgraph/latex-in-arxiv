We propose a mechanism by which electric charges deconfine 
in an Abelian Higgs model with matter fields belonging to 
the fundamental representation of the gauge group. 
Kosterlitz-Thouless like recursion relations for a
scale-dependent stiffness parameter and fugacity are given,
showing that for a logarithmic potential between point 
charges in any dimension, there exists a stable fixed point 
at zero fugacity, with a dimensionality dependent universal 
jump in the stiffness parameter at the phase transition.
