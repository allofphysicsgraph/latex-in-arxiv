\item For a given pair of isospectral systems
intertwined by differential operators of order $N$
there is always a choice of certain
intertwining operators with real coefficients
(not necessarily unique) which lead to
supercharges of a Polynomial SUSY of the same order $N$.
Thereby the $N$-fold SUSY of \cite{ast,ast2}
 for a given
quantum system {\it always} coexists with a Polynomial SUSY of the same order
(and possibly few other polynomial SUSY of different orders).
\item The complex extension of Nonlinear  SUSY
may bring a SUSY algebra different from a polynomial one just containing
non-trivial symmetry operators. These differential operators of odd order  can
be replaced by non-polynomial functions of a Super-Hamiltonian being defined in the
Hilbert space spanned on eigenfunctions of the Super-Hamiltonian. Thus for the same
Super-Hamiltonian one can simultaneously introduce the nonlinear SUSY in both a
polynomial and a non-polynomial form. In particular it
covers the propositions of the AST theorem.
\item Among the (infinite) variety of supercharges of type $Q$ (or of type 
$\bar Q$) commuting with a given
Super-Hamiltonian one can systematically find the optimal set of (no more than)
two basic SUSY
generators  
which are differential operators of even and odd order with
real coefficients. Respectively
all other supercharges of type $Q$ (or of type 
$\bar Q$) represent linear combinations of  basic
supercharge(s) with coefficient(s) polynomial in the Super-Hamiltonian.
For two essentially independent supercharges a dynamical  symmetry 
for the Super-Hamiltonian arises and the related symmetry 
operator is
unique up to a multiplier polynomial in the Super-Hamiltonian.
\item There is
a more efficient formulation of the AST theorem
which manifestly  uses the emerging
 dynamical symmetry for a Super-Hamiltonian with two supercharges
and uniquely specifies the relationship between $q^\pm$,
$\pi^\pm_1$ and $\pi^\pm_2$ and between the matrices
$\bar{\bf S}^+$ and $\bar{\bf S}^-$.
\item For isospectral systems with two independent
supercharges the notion of irreducibility for Polynomial SUSY
formulated in \cite{acdi} does not characterize firmly potentials and
the same system may be well described by a more reducible and less reducible
SUSY algebra.
