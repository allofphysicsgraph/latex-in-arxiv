\begin{abstract}
We formulate QFT on a $\mathbb{R}^{1,d}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold, in a manner which is
invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ time and space reversal. This is a
background with closed time-like curves. It is also relevant for
the elliptic interpretation of de Sitter space. We calculate the
one-loop vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor in the
invariant QFT, and show that it does not diverge at the boundary
of the region of closed time-like curves. Rather, the only
divergence is at the initial time slice of the orbifold, analogous
to a spacelike Big-Bang singularity. We then calculate the
one-loop graviton tadpole in bosonic string theory, and show that
the answer is the same as if the target space would be just the
Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1,d}$, suggesting that the tadpole
vanishes for the superstring. Finally, we argue that it is
possible to define local S-matrices, even if the spacetime is
globally time-nonorientable.
