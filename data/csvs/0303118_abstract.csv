Thirty years ago, Coleman proved
that no continuous symmetry is broken spontaneously
in a two-dimensional relativistic quantum field theory.
In his argument, however, it is difficult 
to understand the physical meaning of the assumption 
of no infrared divergence.
I derive the same result directly from the cluster property
of a local field regarded as a physically 
acceptable assumption.
