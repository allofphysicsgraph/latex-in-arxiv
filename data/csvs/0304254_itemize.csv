\item The vanishing theorem is valid if one can isolate the timelike direction as a $c=1$ CFT and if the matter Hilbert space is written as a direct product of two Verma modules (as in Theorem~\ref{thm:vanishing}), one for the $c=1$ CFT and another for the rest, which is assumed to be a unitary CFT.
\item The no-ghost theorem is also valid for the above Hilbert space (under a certain condition. See~Theorem~\ref{thm:no-ghost}.)
%\item Moreover, when the $c=1$ part is written in terms of a $U(1)$ boson, one can show the no-ghost theorem.

\item Step~1:
The first is to show the {\it vanishing theorem}. The vanishing theorem states that the $\hat{Q}$-cohomology is trivial except at the zero ghost number. This is done by choosing an appropriate {\it filtration} for your BRST operator $\hat{Q}$. A filtration allows us to use a simplified BRST operator $Q_{0}$ and we can first study the cohomology of $ Q_{0} $. If the $ Q_{0} $-cohomology is trivial, so is the $\hat{Q}$-cohomology (Lemma~3.1 of Ref.~\cite{Asano:2000fp}); this is the reason why the filtration is so useful. However, the particular filtration used in standard proofs is also part of the reason why $d \geq 2$ in those proofs. 

\item Step~2:
The second is to compute and compare the {\it index} and the {\it signature} of the cohomology group explicitly. If the index is equal to the signature, the no-ghost theorem holds provided the vanishing theorem is valid.

Write the matter Hilbert space in terms of products of two Verma modules, one for the $c=1$ CFT and the other for the unitary CFT $K$.

\item[$\circ$] Step~1.1:
Apply our filtration \'{a} la Frenkel, Garland, and Zuckerman (Ref.\cite{Frenkel:1986dg}; Eq.~(35) of Ref.~\cite{Asano:2000fp}). With FGZ's filtration, the simplified BRST operator $Q_0$ can be further decomposed as a sum of two differentials, $d'$ and $d''$. This decomposition is crucial for the proof; it reduces the problem to the $d'$-cohomology, and $d'$ acts only on a ``$c=1$"" CFT, which contains the timelike part and the $b$ ghost part. This is the reason why the proof does not require $d \geq 2$. 
%
\item[$\circ$] Step~1.2:
If the $d'$-cohomology is trivial, so is the $Q_0$-cohomology. This follows from a K\""{u}nneth formula. Then, the $\hat{Q}$-cohomology is trivial as well from the general property of filtration.
%
\item[$\circ$] Step~1.3:
Now, the problem is reduced to the $d'$-cohomology. Show the vanishing theorem for the $d'$-cohomology. 
%This is possible if the ``$\hc=1$"" part is written in terms of Verma modules.
