\caption{The behaviours of three scales. A physical scale ($R$) starts well inside the Hubble length
($H^{-1}$), then crosses outside sometime before the end of inflation, reentering long after inflation is over.
Also the de Sitter scale ($l_4$) is introduced. The vertical axis covers many powers of 10 in scale.}
