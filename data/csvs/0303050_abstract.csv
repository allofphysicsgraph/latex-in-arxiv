A multidimensional gravitational model with
several scalar fields and fields of forms is considered.
A wide class of generalized  $pp$-wave solutions
defined on a product of $n+1$ Ricci-flat spaces is obtained.
Certain examples of solutions (e.g. in supergravitational
theories) are singled out. For special cone-type internal factor spaces
the solutions are written in Brinkmann form.
An example of $pp$-wave solution is obtained using  Penrose limit
of a solution defined on product of two Einstein spaces.
