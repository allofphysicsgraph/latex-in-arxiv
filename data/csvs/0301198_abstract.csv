We investigate both analytically and numerically the evolution of
scalar perturbations generated in models which exhibit a {\em
smooth} transition from a contracting to an expanding Friedmann
universe. If the perturbation equations during the transition can
be formulated as second order equations for either the Bardeen
potential, $\Psi$ or the curvature perturbation on uniform
comoving hypersurfaces, $\zeta$, then regular variables $u$ or $v$
respectively can be found. We find that the resulting spectral
index in the late radiation dominated universe {\em depends} on
which of these two variables passes regularly through the
transition. The results can be parameterized through the exponent
$q$ defining the rate of contraction of the universe, or
equivalently through the equation of state $w=\frac{2-q}{3q}$ of
the background fluid. For $q \geqslant -\frac{1}{2}$ we find that
there are {\em no} stable cases where both $\Psi$ and $\zeta$, are
regular during the transition. In particular, for $0<q\ll 1$, we
find that the resulting spectral index is close to scale invariant
if $\Psi$ is regular, whereas it has a steep blue behavior if
$\zeta$ is regular. We also show that as long as $q\leqslant 1$,
perturbations arising from the Bardeen potential remain small
during contraction in the sense that there exists a gauge in which
all the metric and matter perturbation variables are small. The
work has important implications for the current debate concerning
the nature of perturbations evolving through a collapsing regime
into an expanding one: it shows that if in the ekpyrotic model,
where $0<q\ll 1$, the Bardeen potential passes regularly through
the transition, this leads to a nearly scale invariant spectrum
with $n=1-2q$, whereas in the case of dilaton-driven string
cosmology we have the opposite situation, where it is assumed that
$\zeta$ passes regularly through the transition, leading to a very
blue spectrum of highly suppressed perturbations.
