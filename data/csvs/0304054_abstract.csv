Simple $D=4$ supergravity is obtained from the gauge theory of the inhomogeneous orthosymplectic group IOSp$(3,1|4)$ on a $(4,4)$-dimensional base supermanifold by imposing constraints and talking a limit. Both the constraints and the limiting procedure have a clear {\it a priori} physical motivation. The construction has similarities with the space-time formulation of Newtonian gravity.
