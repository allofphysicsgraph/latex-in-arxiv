  inspired key developments in loop quantum gravity including the discovery
  that Chern-Simons theory plays a role in describing the quantum
  geometry of boundaries and horizons, leading to the present
  understanding of black hole entropy\cite{linking,isolated}.}.

    These two postulates are assumed by string theory to be exact. The

    incorporating gravitons in which they can be exactly realized.

    In contrast, loop quantum gravity takes the attitude that we must
    make a quantization of general relativity that does not rely on
    these two assumptions. Indeed, as global lorentz invariance is not a
    symmetry of classical general relativity, it cannot be assumed
    in any exact quantization of the theory. These two 
    assumptions are then to be tested, in the sense that one must see to

 \item{}{\bf Conformal induction\cite{witten-CI,matthiaslee}.}
 Consider a quantum theory, $T_1$ defined
 by a path integral, on a background $\cal B$ whose spacetime is of
 the form of ${\cal M}^{d} $ where  ${\cal M}^{d}$ is either 
 an anti-deSitter spacetime, or a
more general spacetime that is asymptotically anti-deSitter. Then it can
 be shown that this spacetime has a boundary whose timelike component
 is isomorphic to
 $M^{d-1}$ where $M^{d-1}$ is flat spacetime. One
can then argue generally that one can define a quantum field theory on
 the boundary by evaluating expectation values of local operators in
 the theory $T_1$ in which all the operators are taken to the
boundary.
 One can also argue that this new theory must be conformally invariant
 (or more specifically have exact scale invariance, with perhaps spontaneously
 broken conformal invariance.)

 Furthermore the same holds for quantum theories defined on spacetimes
 of the form given, producted by a compact manifold. 
 
 Thus in these cases a conformal field theory on the boundary is
 defined from a subset of the observables of the bulk theory, those
 in which N point functions for fields are evaluated all on the
 boundary.  We may say that the boundary theory is {\it conformally induced}
 from the bulk theory. In such cases, some
 of the observables of the bulk theory are computable in terms of
 $N$-point functions of the boundary theory. But in the general case
 there is no reason to believe that the two theories are isomorphic,
 for there will generally be observables of the bulk theory that are
 not computable in terms only of $N$-point functions on the conformal
 boundary.  One reason is that there are components of the boundary
 of an AdS spacetime besides the timelike component which is
 isomorphic to $M^{d-1}$. This includes future and past timelike infinity.

 \item{}There are many results that suggest that the
 conformal induction of linearized supergravity on
 $AdS^5 \times S^{5}$ is a certain limit of the
 $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on four dimensional flat
 spacetime\cite{witten-CI,AdS-review}.

 \item{}There are additional results that strongly indicate that the
 conformal induction of supergravity on various asymptotically
 $AdS^5$ spacetimes is
related in this way to $N=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory by reduction
 or symmetry breaking\cite{AdS-review}.
 Among them are results that are consistent
 with the conjecture that the linearization of supergravity
 on the AdS-Schwarzschild solution
 induces a thermal state in the Yang-Mills theory\cite{AdS-thermal}.

 \item{}Still other results of this kind hold for other $d$.

 \item{}It is not, however, completely established whether perturbative string
 theory is well defined on an $AdS^{5}\times S^{5}$ background, beyond
 the supergravity approximation.
 While the classical action for a
 free string on the $AdS^{5}\times S^{5}$ background has been
 constructed\cite{arkady}, there is no gauge in which it is a free theory. 
 Thus the
 free string theory cannot be solved exactly on an $AdS^{5}\times
 S^{5}$ background, as it can be in the case of flat ten dimensional spacetime.
 Instead, to define the free string theory one has to treat it as an
 interacting two dimensional quantum field theory, defined on
 the string world sheet\cite{AdS-problem}.

 The resulting theory has been studied and, in some particular
 examples, shown to be a conformal field theory at least the
 one loop level\cite{ADN}.  There are also arguments that the theory
 remains a conformal field theory to all orders\cite{renata-arivand,ADN}.
 These results are very reassuring, but we are still apparently lacking
 a general proof of the consistency of the interacting string theory,
 as is possible on flat space through at least the two loop order.


 \item{}A certain limit of $AdS^5 \times S^5$ is known which is
 a plane wave\cite{PPwave}.
 This is gotten by expanding the metric around a null
 geodesic that circles the sphere, while remaining at the center of
 the $AdS^5$.   In this case the free quantum
 string theory can be constructed and solved explicitly.
  The analogous
 limit can be constructed in the $N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.
 The resulting spectra matches
 that of the string theory on the plane wave.


 \item{}There is a general result of axiomatic quantum
 field\cite{rehren}
 theory that, given an exactly conformally invariant
 quantum field theory, without anomaly, on $Minkowski^{d}$,
 constructs an axiomatic quantum field on $AdS^{d+1}$. This
 result is rigorous, but it requires that the theory on
 $Minkowski^{d}$ have no anomaly in any of the generators of the
 conformal group. However, the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
 do not satisfy this, at least in perturbation theory\cite{anti-rehren}.
 While they
have $\beta=0$, and hence no anomaly in the action of  dilitations,
 they have anomalies in the action of the large conformal transformations.
 Hence it appears that the gauge theory cases studied are not
 examples of this particular version of the correspondence.

      \item{}There are a very large number of string theory
      backgrounds, labeled by both discrete topological classes
      and continuous parameters.

     \item{}So far, no string theory background is known which 
     is consistent with all features of the observed universe.
      They all have one or more of
the following features, which each disagree with observation:
no positive cosmological constant, unbroken supersymmetry, massless scalar
      fields.

      \item{}So far no string theory background is known which is 
      time dependent, as is our universe. Further no stable string theory 
      background is known which is
      consistent with recent observations that strongly suggest that
      there is a positive cosmological
      constant\cite{stringcosmoproblem}.

\item{}Further, we observe no massless scalar fields. Thus
in  any string background corresponding to
      nature there can be no such fields.  This means that the
      compactified geometry must be a consistent background only for
      discrete values of its parameters. At the same time, those
      parameters must have very small ratios in them, to explain the
      hierarchy problem.


      \item{}Even if a string theory background is found which is
also  consistent with everything that is observed, does this tell us anything,
      given that there is an infinite space of possible string
      backgrounds to search?  The theory would be predictive only if
      there were a unique string background consistent with what is
      observed. Is there any reason to believe this is the case,
      rather than there being a large or infinite number of such
      backgrounds\footnote{For estimates on the number of 
      non-supersymmetric string vacua, see
\cite{lenny-anthro,mikedouglas}. While no stable,
consistent, non-supersymmetric string vacua have yet been constructed, 
these authors argue, using recent developments, that the number of
such theories may be absolutely enormous.}?

      So, we should ask, even if there is a unique string theory
      background consistent with what is observed, how would nature
      pick it out? One might hope that there were a principle of
      stability or lowest energy that would pick out a unique
      string theory background. However this is unfortunately
      unlikely.
      We have good reason to believe\footnote{From
      results that support the conjecture of $S$-duality.} that many
of the
      supersymmetric vacua are stable. So it appears very unlikely that the
      observed background is the only stable one.

    Thus, even if string theory is true,
      there is so far no reason to believe that nature has a unique choice
      as to low energy phenomenology. Whatever the hopes, present
      evidence from string theory is more compatible with the idea
      that the observed background is picked out from many possible
      consistent ones by some dynamical process, occurring in the
early  universe, or even before the big bang\footnote{One such theory
      is cosmological natural selection\cite{CNS,LOTC}, which was invented
      to address
      this issue in string theory.  It remains falsifiable, but so
far  it has not been falsified and is
      consistent with all observations to date.}.

      This circumstance suggests that perhaps some attention be given
      to what might be called the search question in string theory.
      Given what we know, it is likely that if string theory is true,
      the real world is described by one out of a very large number of
      local minima of some potential or energy functional.
      This may be either a function on the space of string
      backgrounds or the expectation value of a potential or
      Hamiltonian in some fundamental Hilbert space of string theory.
      In either case, we have to find the global minimum of a function on
      a high dimensional space, which parameterizes possible string
      backgrounds. Further, we expect that the function has many
      local extrema, corresponding to the perturbatively consistent
      string theories. How do we find its global extremum?

      Further, if the global minimum is to agree with
      observed physics, there can be no
      massless moduli fields. This means that
      the true minimum must be an isolated point in the space of
      consistent string theories. However, all known
      consistent string theories have massless scalar fields, this
      means that all the local minima that correspond to them
      live in continuous submanifolds of solutions.

      How then are we to find the one true, isolated minima of
      a very complicated potential, which we know has lots of other
      minima, many of which have much more measure than the solution
      we seek?

      It is fair to ask whether examining them one by one, as they 
      are discovered by
      people putting together ever more complicated combinations of branes,
      orbifolds and complex manifolds is likely to hit on the true
      one. After all, the number of consistent backgrounds vastly
      outnumbers the number of people working in the field.
      Should we  be concerned that picking out the true minimum of a complex
      potential with a large number of local minimum is known from
      results in the theory of computation to be a
      very hard problem?

      A striking result of complexity theory is somewhat worrying in
      this regard. Called the ``no free lunch theorem'' this states that
      no specific search algorithm is likely to do better than random search in
      finding the global minimum of a randomly chosen complicated
      potential\cite{lunchcosts}. To do better than random search, a
      search procedure must be based on an algorithm which is crafted
      taking into account some properties of a given potential.

      This suggests that if we are ever to find the string vacua that
      describes our world we need to craft a search algorithm based on
     some non-trivial property of string theory, rather than just
     studying more and more complicated string vacua as the tools are
     developed to define them.


      \item{}It must also be emphasized that string theory does not
      give a genuine quantum theory of gravity, in the sense that
      each consistent string theory is defined with respect to a fixed,
      classical, non-dynamical background. So it is not background
      independent and it fails to address
      many of the questions that a quantum theory of gravity
      must answer\footnote{Some string theorists have argued that the
      Maldacena conjecture offers a non-perturbative definition of
      string theory that is background independent in the sense that
      all observables of quantum gravity are mapped into observables
      of the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The only restriction
      is that the quantum spacetime must be asymptotically
      $AdS$.  This is perhaps an attractive proposal, but it itself depends
      on a positive resolution of some of the open issues discussed 
      above.}.

      Related to this is the fact that the black hole results in
      string theory do not concern actual black holes. They concern
      instead ensembles of states in free string theory in flat
      spacetime, with the
      gravitational coupling turned off. So far, no way has so
      far been found to extend the results to black holes that are
      not extremal or near extremal\footnote{Although there are
      suggestive results in a matrix form of string theory that this
      might become possible\cite{matrixbh}.  }.

    to date involving gauge theory/supergravity or gauge theory/string theory
    correspondences are consequences of either conformal induction or
    the supersymmetry algebra applied to the $BPS$ states. Nor does
    string theory give a consistent description of quantum black hole
    spacetimes, apart from results concerning $BPS$ and near $BPS$ states.

    \item{}{\bf Weak causal set hypothesis} A quantum spacetime history
    provides a list of events $\cal E$, with a partial order,  $\cal 
    P$, representing their 
    causal relations. When that quantum spacetime has a semiclassical 
    description in terms of a manifold $\cal M$ and a 
    diffeomorphism equivalence class of Lorentzian metrics $g_{ab}$,
    then 1) the events of $\cal P$ (or coarse grained sets of them) 
    can be imbedded in $\cal M$, 2) the causal structure of $\cal P$ can be 
    imbedded, modulo
    some method of coarse graining, in that of $g_{ab}$ and 3) the volume
    measured by $\sqrt{det(g)}$ counts the number of events in each
    region of $\cal M$ given by the embedding.
    
    \item{}{\bf Strong causal set hypothesis.} At the most 
    fundamental level, a quantum spacetime history consists of nothing
    but a discrete set of events $\cal E$ together with their causal
    relations $\cal P$.

\item{}Crane:  Hilbert spaces are associated with boundaries that
split the universe into parts.  By the relationship of GR to TQFT
these will be described in terms of
{\it finite dimensional state spaces}\cite{louis-holo}.

\item{}Rovelli:   The Hilbert space describes the information one
part of the universe has about another part\cite{carlo-relate}.

\item{}Markopoulou:  Different Hilbert spaces are associated with
local observers inside the universe and describe information coming
from their past light cones. Quantum cosmology without the
wave function of the universe\cite{Fotini-QCH}.

\item{}Butterfield and Isham: The right mathematics for relational
quantum theory is topos theory\cite{BI}.

\item{}A surface in space is a channel through which quantum
information flows.  All measurements are made on such surfaces.
Each surface has associated to
it a Hilbert space that contains the possible outcomes of measurements
made on that surface.


\item{}The area of the surface is another name for its capacity as a
channel of quantum information. The log of the dimension of the Hilbert
space of each surface is hence taken to be a definition of its area. In
this way geometry is reduced ultimately to information theory.

\item{}This is the basis of a measurement theory for spatially closed
causal spin foam
