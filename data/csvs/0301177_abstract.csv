It is argued that a phenomenologically viable
grand unification model from superstring is
$SU(3)^3$, the simplest gauge group among
the grand unifications of the electroweak hypercharge embedded
in semi-simple groups. We construct a realistic 4D
$SU(3)^3$ model with the GUT scale $\sin^2\theta_W^0=
\frac38$ in a $Z_3$ orbifold with Wilson line(s).
By two GUT scale vacuum expectation values, we obtain
a rank 4 supersymmetric standard model below the GUT scale,
and predict three more strange families.
