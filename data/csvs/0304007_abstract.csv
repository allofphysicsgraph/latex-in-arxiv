We construct supergravity solutions dual to microstates of the
D1-D3-D5 system with nonzero B field
moduli. Just like the  D1-D5 solutions in  hep-th/0109154 these
solutions are generically nonsingular
everywhere, with the `throat' closing smoothly near r=0.  We write  expressions
relating the asymptotic supergravity fields to the integral brane
charges. We study the infall of a D1
brane  down the throat of the geometries. This test brane `bounces'
off the smooth end for generic initial
conditions.  The details of the bounce depend on both the choice of
D1-D3-D5 microstate and the direction
of approach of the infalling D1 brane. In the dual field theory
description we see that the tachyon mode
starts to condense, but the tachyon bounces back up the potential
hill without reaching the deepest point
of the potential.
