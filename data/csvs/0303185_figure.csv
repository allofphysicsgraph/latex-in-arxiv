\caption{A sample of the phenomenology predicted by different
     consistent string theories. The vertical axis is the number of
     Higgs fields, up to 480, the horizontal axis is related to the number of
     left handed fermion fields minus the number of
     right handed fermion fields.
     According to string theory we could equally well live in any
     of these universes. From
     \cite{varietyofstrings}. }
