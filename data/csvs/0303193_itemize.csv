\item{- Brane Probe}: Setting $Q=0$ in $H$ first, we see that, only if  $\mu_1=
\mu_2$ ,
$\theta'$ has a chance to have zero modes: $~\theta'\chi = 0 \Leftrightarrow
\Gamma_{1234}\chi = \chi$. In this case we find
4 standard spinors $\epsilon  =
e^{\frac{x^+}{4}\theta''}\chi$ with $ \Gamma_{+-5}\chi =
\chi\, ,
\theta'\chi = \Gamma_{-}
\chi = 0$ . For supernumeraries we obtain 0,
since in this case $\Omega_\alpha''  \sim
\Gamma_{-}\Gamma_{ \alpha}\theta''  $ has no zero modes.
Altogether this gives $4 (4+0)$ supersymmetries.
\item{- Sugra:}
The additional condition $\partial_\alpha\theta\epsilon = 0$ is met
iff $\theta'\epsilon=0$. So, we get the same set of projections for
standard spinors
$\eta = H^{-1/6}\epsilon= H^{-1/6}e^{\frac{x^+}{4}\theta''}\chi$. Since
there were already no supernumeraries, we get
$4 (4+0)$ supersymmetries.

\item {\underline{$(+,-, ( 0,0,0),1,0)$}}.
The brane extends along the $z_7$ coordinate. There is no smearing and
the profile exhibits no deformation:
\beqa

\item{- Brane Probe:} Setting $Q=0$ in $H$, we get  2 standard (constant)
spinors
$\epsilon =\chi$, with
$\theta'\chi =   \Gamma_{-}\chi = 0 $ and $\Gamma_{+-7}\chi = \chi$.
Also there are 2 supernumerary spinors $\epsilon =
e^{x^\alpha\Omega_\alpha}\chi$
with $\Omega_a\chi = \Omega_7\chi = 0 \Leftrightarrow \theta\chi =
0$, as well as $\Gamma_+\chi = 0$ and
$\Gamma_{+-7}\chi = \chi$.  We find altogether $4 (2+2)$ supersymmetries.
\item{- Sugra:} Here also, when $Q\neq 0$, the constraint
$\partial_\alpha\theta\epsilon = 0$ is fulfilled   if $\theta'\epsilon =
0$. Therefore, the same number of standard spinors as in the brane probe
approach occur and
$\eta=H^{-1/6}\epsilon = H^{-1/6}\chi$. Also, from
(\ref{stsiete}) we see that $\partial_\beta\Omega_\alpha = 0$,
and $\partial_\alpha\Omega_a\epsilon\sim \theta'\epsilon = 0$.
Thus,  two supernumerary spinors also survive:
$\eta=H^{-1/6}\epsilon=  H^{-1/6}e^{x^\alpha\Omega_\alpha}\chi$. Then,
we find  $4 (2+2)$ supersymmetries.

\begin{description}
\item{- Brane Probe:} There are 8 standard spinors $\epsilon=
e^{\frac{x^+}{4}\theta''}\chi$ with $\Gamma_{+-9}\chi =\chi,~\Gamma_-\chi
= 0$. We have 2 supernumeraries without scalars $\epsilon=
e^{x^9\Omega_9}\chi$,
$\Gamma_{+-9}\chi =\chi,~\Gamma_+\chi =  \theta \chi= 0$.
With scalars, the condition $\Omega''_\alpha\chi = 0$ is impossible for
$\alpha=1,...,6$ and,
hence, there are no spinors. In summary we obtain $10 (8+2)$
supersymmetries without scalars and
$8 (8+0)$ with scalars.
\item{- Sugra:} If $Q\neq 0$, still $\partial_\alpha\theta=0$,
  so the brane-probe analysis is not modified for
standard spinors. For supernumeraries, $\partial_\beta\Omega_\alpha\neq 0$
(see (\ref{stsiete})), hence one must have  $\Omega_\alpha\epsilon=0$,
which is
again impossible. Therefore we find
$8(8+0)$ supersymmetries.

Also we get

$\epsilon= e^{x^a\Omega_a}\chi; $
$\Gamma_{+-1234}\chi =\chi,~\Gamma_+\chi = \theta \chi= 0 $.
With scalars, $\Omega''_\alpha\chi = 0$ is impossible for

case.
In summary, we obtain $10 (8+2)$ and $8 (8+0)$ supersymmetries.

\item{- Sugra:}
Now, with $Q\neq 0$ the profile $W$ is difficult to
solve for. Moreover, we have the additional  integrability condition
$\partial_\alpha\theta\epsilon = 0$, which is impossible to fulfill because
$\partial_\alpha\theta\sim \Gamma_{569}$. Therefore, we do not have any
supersymmetry in this case.

\item \underline{$(+,-,(1,1,2),0,0)$}. The brane extends along $y_1,y_3,

\item{- Brane-Probe:} Setting $Q=0$, only for $\mu_1 = \mu_2$~,   four standard
spinors exist,
$\epsilon = e^{\frac{x^+}{4}\theta''}\chi $,  with $\Gamma_{+-1356}\chi =
\chi$  and
$\theta'\chi = \Gamma_-\chi = 0$. For supernumerary spinors without scalars we
must impose
$\Omega'_a \chi =  0 $. This can have a solution for $a= 5,6$ if $\mu_1=
\mu_2$,  but not for $a=1,3$.
Therefore we find no supernumerary spinors.
 \item{- Sugra:}
For $Q\neq 0$, the supergravity analysis coincides with the brane-probe
analysis because
$\partial_\alpha \theta \chi \sim \theta'\chi = 0$ is one of the
defining conditions of the standard spinors and, thus,  there are no
supernumeraries.  In all cases we find  $4 (4+0)$ supersymmetries.

\item{- Brane Probe:} with $Q=0$ we find 2 standard spinors $\epsilon =

\chi, \Gamma_-\chi = \theta' \chi = 0)$. Also we find
 0 supernumerary spinors because $\Omega'_a\chi = 0$  for
$a=z_7$ implies $\theta'\chi = 0$, but then for $a=1,3,5$ there is no solution.
\item{- Sugra:} With $Q\neq 0$, the same projections
as in the supergravity analysis are obtained, namely
$\partial_\alpha\theta \epsilon = 0
\Leftrightarrow \theta'=0$.  Altogether
we have $2(2+0)$ supersymmetries in all cases.

\item \underline{$(+,-,(1,1,1),0,1)$}. Now, contrarily to the previous
case, smearing occurs along all the $y_\alpha$ directions. Therefore only
$z_7,z_8$ are  transverse and we find:

obtained: $\epsilon = e^{\frac{x^+}{4}\theta''}\chi
~(\Gamma_{+-1359}\chi = \chi, \, \Gamma_-\chi = 0)$. Without scalars,
 we find  2 supernumerary spinors  $\epsilon =
e^{x^a\Omega_a}\chi~(\Gamma_{+-1359}\chi = \chi, \Gamma_+\chi =
\theta\chi = 0)$. When scalars are excited, $\Omega''_\alpha \chi = 0$ is
impossible for $\alpha = 2,4,6$. Altogether for this configuration we get $10
(8+2)$ and $8 (8+0)$ supersymmetries.
\item {- Sugra:} If $Q\neq 0$ no change occurs since $\theta$ is
independent of $H$, and there are no supernumerary spinors. So,
in this case one also gets $8 (8+0)$ supersymmetries.
\end{description}

\item \underline{$(+,-,(2,1,0),1,0)$}. The harmonic function can only
depend on $y_3$ and $z_8$, all other directions being either world-volume
or smeared. Thus:

The profile is difficult to solve for.  In any case the embedding is not
supersymmetric, since  $\theta'$ in this case has no zero modes.

\item \underline{$(+,-,(2,1,0),0,1)$}. In this case:
\beqa

\begin{description}
\item{- Brane Probe:} When $H=1$ and   $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ there are 4 standard
spinors
$\epsilon = e^{\frac{x^+}{4}\theta''}\chi~(\Gamma_{+-1239}\chi =
\chi,
\Gamma_-\chi = \theta'\chi = 0)$. Concerning supernumerary spinors,
they must satisfy $\Omega''_\alpha \chi = 0$. For $\alpha=7,8$
this is tantamount to $\theta''\chi = 0$, which is impossible, since
$\theta''$ has no zero modes. Hence no supernumerary spinors survive
and we have $4 (4+0)$ supersymmetries.
\item{-  Sugra:} From our general rule, the brane should be smeared in the
$y_4$ coordinate. However $F_{wave}\wedge F_{brane}$ is not zero unless the
brane is completely smeared and $H$ is constant. Thus, in this case the only
supergravity solution we find is the original pp-wave.



\end{description}
\item \underline{$(+,-,(2,0,0),2,0)$}. There is smearing along all
$y_\alpha$ coordinates. And since $z_a$ are also internal, there
is no external volume to the brane, and it dissolves completely,
reverting to the original $pp$-wave.

\item \underline{$(+,-,(2,0,0),1,1)$}. For this configuration:
\beqa

 0 supernumerary spinors, since $\Omega'_a\chi=0$ is not possible with
$a=1,2$. Thus this system is $2 (2+0)$ supersymmetric.
\item{- Sugra:} In this case $d{}^*F=0$ without any smearing. However,
$F_{wave}\wedge F_{brane}$ is zero only when $H$ is constant, which corresponds
to the pure pp-wave.

  0 supernumeraries, because $\theta''$ has no zero modes:
\ie\ this configuration is $4 (4+0)$ supersymmetric.

\item
\underline{$(+,-,(1,1,0),1,1)$}. The brane extends along $y_1,y_2,z_7, y_9$

H &=&  1 + \frac{Q}{(  y_5^2+  y_6^2 + z_8^2)^{1/2}}\,\,.
\nonumber
\eeqa
No spinors in any case, since $\theta'$ has no zero modes.
Profile $W$ seems  difficult to solve for.


\item \underline{$(+,-,(1,0,0),2,1)$}. The brane covers $y_1,z_7,z_8,y_9$
and is smeared along $y_2$. Therefore:

spinors, $\epsilon= e^{\frac{x^+}{4}\theta''}\chi$, with
$\Gamma_{+-1789}\chi = \chi$ and $\Gamma_- \chi = \theta' \chi = 0$.
No supernumeraries appear because $\theta''$ has no zero modes.
\item{- Sugra:} For $Q\neq 0$,  the condition $\partial_\alpha\theta\chi =
0$ is fulfilled with $\theta'\chi = 0$. So, the analysis goes through, and
we have 4 standard spinors $\eta=H^{-1/12}\epsilon = H^{-1/12}
e^{\frac{x^+}{4}\theta''}\chi$,  with the same $\chi$ as before.
In all cases we have $4(4+0)$ supersymmtries.
