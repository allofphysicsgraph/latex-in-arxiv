\caption{\small The dynamics corresponds to the  
particle motion under a  potential with zero energy. We depict the
shape of the potential here. We are interested in the trajectory in which 
the particle starts from infinity, reflected at $f_{min}$ and goes back
to infinity.}

of our solutions is depicted here for the Poincare type coordinate. 
Each point on the plane corresponds to ${ R}^2$.
The coordinate $\mu$ is the polar angle and $y$ is the radial coordinate
with $W$ as the origin.   
The total boundary consists of two parts, each of which has the geometry of
a half of ${R}^3$.  These two parts are joined through $W$, which may be 
viewed as a kind of  domain wall on the boundary. }
