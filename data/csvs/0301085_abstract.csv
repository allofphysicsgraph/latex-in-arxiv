  A general method of the BRST--anti-BRST symmetric conversion of
  second-class constraints is presented.  It yields a pair of
  commuting and nilpotent BRST-type charges that can be naturally
  regarded as BRST and anti-BRST ones.  Interchanging the BRST and
  anti-BRST generators corresponds to a symmetry between the original
  second-class constraints and the conversion variables, which
  enter the formalism on equal footing.
