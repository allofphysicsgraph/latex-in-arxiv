Using the technique \cite{holgernorma2002} to construct a basis for spinors and families of
spinors in terms of Clifford algebra objects, we define other Clifford algebra objects, 
which transform a state of one ''family'' of spinors into a state of another ''family'' of spinors,
changing nothing but the ''family'' number.  
The proposed transformation  works - as does the technique - for all dimensions and any signature,
opening a way for understanding families of quarks and leptons.
