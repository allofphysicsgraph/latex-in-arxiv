\noi In order to evaluate the Feynman path integral in
noncommutative quantum mechanics, we consider properties of a
Lagrangian  related to a quadratic Hamiltonian with noncommutative
spatial coordinates. A quantum-mechanical system with
noncommutative coordinates is equivalent to another one with
commutative coordinates. We found connection between quadratic
classical Lagrangians of these two systems. We also shown that
there is a subclass  of quadratic Lagrangians, which includes
harmonic oscillator  and particle in a constant field, whose
connection between ordinary and noncommutative regimes can be
expressed as a linear change of position in terms of a new
position and velocity.
