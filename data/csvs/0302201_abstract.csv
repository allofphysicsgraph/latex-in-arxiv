Recently, it was pointed out that quantum orders and the associated
projective symmetry groups can produce and protect massless gauge bosons and
massless fermions in local bosonic models. In this paper, we demonstrate that
a state with such kind of quantum orders can be viewed as a string condensed
state.  The emerging gauge bosons and fermions in local bosonic models can be
regarded as a direct consequence of string condensation.
The gauge bosons are fluctuations of large 
closed strings which are condensed in the ground
state.  The ends of condensed open strings are the charged particles of the
corresponding gauge field.  For certain types of strings, the ends of strings
can even be fermions.  According to the string picture, 
fermions always carry gauge charges. This suggests the existence of
a new discrete gauge field that couples to neutrinos and neutrons.  We also
discuss how chiral symmetry that protects massless Dirac fermions can emerge
from the projective symmetry of quantum order.
