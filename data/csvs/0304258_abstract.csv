 We propose three supersymmetric $G^3$ models
with $S_3$ symmetry and minimal stacks of D6-branes
 from the intersecting D6-branes
 on Type IIA orientifolds. In those
 models, the RR tadpole can be cancelled and the 4-dimensional
$N=1$ supersymmetry is preserved elegantly. Phenomenologically,
there exists the gauge coupling unification, the Standard Model
fermions and Higgs doublets can be embedded into the bifundamental
representations, but there are no symmetric or anti-symmetric
 representations. Especially in Model I where the gauge group is
$U(4)^3$, we just have three famililes of fermions
 and three pairs of Higgs particles. We also show that
 the $G^3$ gauge symmetry can be broken down to
the Standard Model gauge symmetry by introducing the light open
 string states.
