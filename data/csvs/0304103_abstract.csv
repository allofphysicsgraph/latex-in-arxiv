$N=2$ closed strings have been recently 
divided in hep-th/0211147 to two T-dual families
denoted by $\alpha$ and
$\beta$.
In $(2,2)$ signature both families have one scalar in the spectrum.
The scalar in the $\beta$-string is known to be a deformation 
of the target space K\""ahler potential and the dynamics is that
of self-dual gravity.
In this paper we compute the effective action of the scalar
in the $\alpha$-string. The scalar is a deformation of a potential
that determines the metric, torsion and dilaton.
The scalar is free and the 
dynamics is that of a self-dual curvature with torsion.
