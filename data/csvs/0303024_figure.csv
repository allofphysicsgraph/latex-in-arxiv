A D$p$-brane ending on a D$(p+2)$-brane with volume along some component 
of $H_3$. This represents a consistent way of wrapping a D$(p+2)$-brane on 
a cycles with non-zero $H_3$ flux, or a process mediating the decay of a 
D$p$-brane wrapped on a homologically non-trivial cycle $W$.}

\caption[]{\small A system D8 - (anti-D8)-branes with volume along some 
component of $H_3$ is consistent if there are additional D6-branes 
starting and ending on them. The T-dual version is that a system of D9 -
(anti-D9)-branes with volume along some component of $H_3$ is consistent 
if additional fractional D5-branes are present.}
