\noindent In this paper we present new results on the core
instability of the 't~Hooft Polyakov monopoles we reported on
before. This instability, where the spherical core decays in a
toroidal one, typically occurs in models in which charge conjugation
is gauged. In this paper we also discuss a third conceivable
configuration denoted as ``split core'', which brings us to some
details of the numerical methods we employed. We argue that a core
instability of 't~Hooft Polyakov type monopoles is quite a generic
feature of models with charged Higgs particles.
