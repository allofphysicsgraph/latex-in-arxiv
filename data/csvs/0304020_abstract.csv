We study
various  $Sp(2M)$ invariant field equations corresponding to rank $r$
tensor products of the Fock (singleton) representation of $Sp(2M)$.
These equations are shown to
describe localization on  ``branes'' of different dimensions
embedded into the generalized space-time ${\cal M}_M$ with matrix (i.e.,
``central charge'') coordinates.  The case
of bilinear tensor product is considered in detail.
The conserved currents built from bilinears
of rank 1 fields in ${\cal M}_M$ are shown to satisfy the field equations of the
rank 2 fields in ${\cal M}_M$. Also,
the rank 2 fields in ${\cal M}_M$ are shown to be
equivalent to the rank 1 fields in ${\cal M}_{2M}$.
