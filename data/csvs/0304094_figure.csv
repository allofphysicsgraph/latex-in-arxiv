  \caption{\emph{Left:} Profile of $\tau(\sx)$ in the upper half plane
  for the 2-centered example described in the text.
  The shaded region is the domain of allowed values of $\tau_\infty$.
  The red curve is the line of marginal stability. \emph{Right:} $e^U$ as a
  function of $x$ with the two charges located on the $x$-axis.}
