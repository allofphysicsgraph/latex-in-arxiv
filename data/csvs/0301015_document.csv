We show how, modulo the distinction between the antipode and the
``twisted'' or ``renormalized'' antipode, Connes and Kreimer's
algebraic paradigm trivializes the proofs of equivalence of the
(corrected) Dyson--Salam, Bogoliubov--Parasiuk--Hepp and Zimmermann
procedures for renormalizing Feynman amplitudes. We discuss the
outlook for a parallel simplification of computations in quantum field
theory, stemming from the same algebraic approach.

\section{Introduction}

The present authors have dealt in a Hopf algebraic context with the
relation between the Dyson--Salam, Bogoliubov--Parasiuk and Zimmermann
renormalization schemes in~\cite{Ananke}. This we did using the
algebra of rooted trees $H_R$~\cite{ConnesKrTrees} as a proxy for the
complexities of the combinatorics of Feynman graphs in renormalization.

The point of~\cite{Ananke} was that the differences of the diverse
schemes could largely be tracked down to avatars of the convolution
operation in spaces of homomorphisms of the Hopf algebra. This was
illustrated by the apparently simple-minded, but tremendously
effective, computation of antipode images in $H_R$ by means of the
convolution geometric series.

In this paper we return on the subject, now in terms of Hopf algebras
of the Feynman graphs themselves.

It must be acknowledged that the deeply conceptual approach by Connes
and Kreimer till now has failed to impress many physicists who
practice renormalization theory. For that approach to become
mainstream, it should be shown to simplify both \textit{proofs} and
\textit{calculations} in perturbative renormalization theory.

The proof given by Zimmermann~\cite{Zimmermann} of the equivalence of
his forest formula and Bogo\-liubov and Parasiuk's scheme has a
reputation of difficulty. The Dyson--Salam scheme has been thoroughly
analyzed and purged of difficulties in~\cite{Manoukian}. But the proof
of equivalence between the forest and the (corrected) Dyson--Salam
formulae given in~\cite{Manoukian} is anything but simple.

In contrast, here we show that the equivalence between all the
aforementioned schemes boils down to downright basic facts in Hopf
algebra theory. So basic in fact, that we can only conclude that the
combinatorics of perturbative renormalization finds its definitive
expression in Hopf algebraic terms. Not only the equivalence proofs
result from uniqueness of the Hopf antipode, but we are able to show
that the Dyson--Salam scheme corresponds \textit{identically} to the
convolution geometric series. All our arguments are elementary and
short, much more so, by the way, than in~\cite{Ananke}: in the
previous paper, we did not quite see the forest for the trees.

At the end of the paper we briefly review the perspectives for the
Connes--Kreimer method to simplify other theorems and
\textit{computations} in renormalization, by means of reduction to the
case of elements that are primitive (i.e., without subdivergences).
Here the situation is more mixed; still, the hope remains that
sizeable simplifications can be gleaned from the algebraic approach.


\section{Bialgebras of graphs}

The basics of graded bialgebra theory are recalled in the Appendix.
{}From now on, we assume the reader is familiar with them.

Bialgebras of Feynman graphs, encoding the combinatorics of
renormalization, were introduced by Connes and Kreimer
in~\cite{ConnesKrRHI}. The precise definition we use in this paper was
first given in~\cite{Etoile}. To fix ideas, and whenever an example is
given, we think of the (massless) $\varphi^4_4$ scalar model.
Nevertheless, the constructions hold in any given quantum field
theory, such as the $\varphi^3_6$ model considered
in~\cite{ConnesKrRHI}.

We recall that a \textit{graph} or diagram $\Gamma$ of the theory is
specified by a set $\mathcal{V}(\Gamma)$ of \textit{vertices} and a set $\mathcal{L}(\Gamma)$
of \textit{lines} (propagators) among them; \textit{external} lines
are attached to only one vertex each, \textit{internal} lines to two.
Diagrams with no external lines will not be taken into account ---and
in $\varphi^4_4$ theory only graphs with an even number of external
lines are to be found. Also tadpole diagrams, in which a line connects
a vertex to itself, are excluded in this paper.

Given a graph $\Gamma$, a \textit{subdiagram} $\gamma$ of $\Gamma$ is specified
by a subset of at least two elements of $\mathcal{V}(\Gamma)$ and a subset of the
lines that join these vertices in $\Gamma$. By exception, the empty
subset $\emptyset$ will be admitted as a subdiagram of $\Gamma$. As well
as $\Gamma$ itself. Clearly, the external lines for a subdiagram $\gamma$
include not only a subset of original incident lines, but some
internal lines of $\Gamma$ not included in $\gamma$. The connected pieces of
$\Gamma$ are the maximal connected subdiagrams. A diagram is
\textit{proper} (or 1PI) when the number of its connected pieces would
not increase on the removal of a single internal line; otherwise it is
called \textit{improper}. An improper graph is the union of proper
components plus subdiagrams containing a single line.

A \textit{subgraph} of a proper graph is a subdiagram that contains
all the elements of $\mathcal{L}(\Gamma)$ joining its vertices in the whole graph;
as such, it is determined solely by the vertices. When a subdiagram
contains several connected pieces, each one of them being a subgraph,
we still call it a subgraph. A subgraph of an improper graph $\Gamma$,
distinct from $\Gamma$ itself, is a proper subdiagram each of whose
components is a subgraph with respect to the proper components of
$\Gamma$.

We write $\gamma \subseteq \Gamma$ if and only if $\gamma$ is a subgraph of
$\Gamma$ as defined (not just a subdiagram): this is the really important
concept for us. For renormalization in configuration
space~\cite{Carme}, it is more convenient to deal with subgraphs than
with more general subdiagrams. Zimmermann showed long ago that only
subtractions corresponding to subgraphs need be used~\cite{ZimVW}, and
this dispenses us from dealing with subdiagrams that are not
subgraphs.

Two subgraphs $\gamma_1,\gamma_2$ of $\Gamma$ are said to be
\textit{nonoverlapping} when $\gamma_1 \cap \gamma_2 = \emptyset$ or
$\gamma_1 \subseteq \gamma_2$ or $\gamma_2 \subseteq \gamma_1$; otherwise they are
overlapping. Given $\gamma \subseteq \Gamma$, the quotient graph or cograph
$\Gamma/\gamma$ (reduced graph in Zimmermann's parlance) is defined by
shrinking $\gamma$ in $\Gamma$ to a point, that is to say, $\gamma$ (bereft of
its external lines) is considered as a vertex of $\Gamma$, and all the
lines in $\Gamma$ not belonging to $\gamma$ belong to $\Gamma/\gamma$. This is
modified in the obvious way when $\gamma$ represents a propagator
correction. The graphs $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma/\gamma$ have the same external
structure. A nonempty $\Gamma/\gamma$ will be proper iff $\Gamma$ is proper
---the situation considered in~\cite{ConnesKrRHI}.

Now, the bialgebra $\mathcal{H}$ is defined as the polynomial algebra generated
by the empty set $\emptyset$ and the connected Feynman graphs that are
(superficially) divergent and/or have (superficially) divergent
subgraphs (renormalization parts in Zimmermann's parlance), with set
union as the product operation (hence $\emptyset$ is the unit element
$1\in\mathcal{H}$). The counit is given by $\varepsilon(\Gamma) := 0$ on any generator,
except $\varepsilon(\emptyset) = 1$.

The really telling operation is the coproduct $\Delta: \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H} \otimes \mathcal{H}$;
as it is to be a homomorphism of the algebra structure, we need only
define it on connected diagrams. By definition, the coproduct of $\Gamma$
is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta \Gamma\, := \Gamma \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes \Gamma
+ \sum_{\emptyset\varsubsetneq\gamma\varsubsetneq\Gamma} \gamma \otimes \Gamma/\gamma\,
= \sum_{\emptyset \subseteq \gamma \subseteq \Gamma} \gamma \otimes \Gamma/\gamma.
\label{eq:coprod} %% (1)
\end{equation}
The sum is over all divergent, proper, not necessarily connected
subgraphs of $\Gamma$, such that \textit{each piece} is divergent,
including (and then with the possible exception of, as $\Gamma$ need not
be divergent nor proper) the empty set and $\Gamma$ itself. We put
$\Gamma/\Gamma = 1$. When appropriate, the sum runs also over different
types of local counterterms associated to $\gamma$~\cite{ConnesKrRHI};
this is not needed in our example model.

It is natural to exclude the appearance of tadpole parts in $\Gamma/\gamma$,
and this we do hereafter. This tadpole-free condition was not used or
remarked in~\cite{Etoile}, nor in~\cite{GudrunIII}, which employs the
same definition. We show in Figure~\ref{fg:tadpole-corr} how his
situation can happen. The cograph corresponding to the ``bikini''
subgraph in the upper part of the graph in
Figure~\ref{fg:tadpole-corr} is a tadpole correction and can be
outlawed from the coproduct.

For the proof of the bialgebra properties of $\mathcal{H}$, we refer
to~\cite{Polaris}; for graphical examples of coproducts,
see~\cite{Etoile}.

Actually $\mathcal{H}$ is a connected, graded bialgebra. Obvious grading
operators are available: if $\#(\Gamma)$ denotes the number of vertices
in $\Gamma$ (i.e., the coupling order), then we define the degree of a
generator (connected element) $\Gamma$ as $\nu(\Gamma) := \#(\Gamma) - 1$; the
degree of a product is the sum of the degrees of the factors. This
grading is compatible with the coproduct, and clearly scalars are the
only degree~0 elements. Other gradings are by the number $I(\Gamma)$ of
internal lines in $\Gamma$ and by loop number
$\ell(\Gamma) := I(\Gamma) - \nu(\Gamma)$. For the $\varphi^4_4$ model,
$\ell(\Gamma) = \nu(\Gamma) + 1$ for two-point graphs and
$\ell(\Gamma) = \nu(\Gamma)$ for four-point graphs. A more relevant grading
will emerge in the next section.

Lurking in the background there is a character (i.e., multiplicative)
map $f$ (the ``Feynman rule'') of $\mathcal{H}$ into an algebra $V$ of Feynman
amplitudes: for instance, in dimensional regularization the character
takes values in a ring of Laurent series (with finite order poles) in
the regularization parameter. In physics, the Feynman rules are
essentially fixed by the interpretation of the theory, and thus one
tends to identify $\Gamma$ with $f(\Gamma)$.


\section{The importance of convolution}

Given a unital algebra $(A,m,u)$ and a counital coalgebra
$(C,\Delta,\varepsilon)$ over $\mathbb{F}$, the \textit{convolution} of two elements
$f,g$ of the vector space of $\mathbb{F}$-linear maps $\Hom(C,A)$ is defined
as the map $f * g \in \Hom(C,A)$ given by the composition
$$
C \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^\Delta C \otimes C \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{f\otimes g} A \otimes A \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^m A.
$$
In other words, $f * g = m (f \otimes g) \Delta$. This product
turns $\Hom(C,A)$ into a unital algebra, where the unit is the map
$u \varepsilon$, as is easily checked. In particular, linear endomorphisms of
a bialgebra can be convolved.

A bialgebra $H$ in which the identity map $\mathrm{id}_H$ is invertible under
convolution is called a \textit{Hopf algebra}, and its convolution
inverse $S$ is called the coinverse or \textit{antipode}; that is to
say, $\mathrm{id}_H * S = S * \mathrm{id}_H = u \varepsilon$. The antipode is clearly unique.
It is known to be of order two for commutative bialgebras. Also, in a
commutative bialgebra $S$ is a homomorphism: $S(ab) = S(a)S(b)$.

In particular, if $\Delta(a) = \sum_j a'_j \otimes  a''_j$, then
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon(a) 1_H = u \varepsilon(a) = m(S \otimes \mathrm{id})\Delta(a) = \mathop{\textstyle\sum}\nolimits_j S(a'_j) a''_j,
\label{eq:antipode}% (2)
\end{equation}
and likewise $\varepsilon(a) 1_H = \sum_j a'_j S(a''_j)$. Since any left
inverse under convolution automatically equals any right inverse
provided both exist, any map $S$ satisfying \eqref{eq:antipode} is the
antipode.

The main outcome of equation~\eqref{eq:gr-coprod} in the Appendix for
connected graded bialgebras is that these \textit{are always Hopf}.
Indeed, as is done in~\cite{Ananke}, one can try to compute the
antipode $S\colon H \to H$ by exploiting its very definition as the
convolution inverse of the identity in $H$, via a geometric series:
\begin{equation}
S := (\mathrm{id})^{*-1} = (u \varepsilon -(u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id}))^{*-1}
      = u \varepsilon + (u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id}) + (u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id})^{*2}
      + \cdots
\label{eq:geom-series}% (3)
\end{equation}


\begin{prop}% Proposition 1.
Let $H$ be a connected, graded bialgebra, then the geometric series
expansion of $S(a)$ has at most $n+1$ terms when $a \in H^{(n)}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
If $a \in H^{(0)}$ the claim holds since $(u \varepsilon - \mathrm{id})1 = 0$.
Assume that the claim holds for the elements of $H^{(k)}$ when
$k \leq n-1$, and let $a \in H^{(n)}$; then by~\eqref{eq:gr-coprod}
\begin{align*}
(u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id})^{*(n+1)}(a)
&= (u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id}) * (u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id})^{*n}(a)
\\
&= m [(u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id}) \otimes (u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id})^{*n}] \Delta(a)
\\
&= m [(u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id}) \otimes (u \varepsilon -\mathrm{id})^{*n}]
(a \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes a + \Delta'a).
\end{align*}
The first two terms vanish because $(u \varepsilon - \mathrm{id})1 = 0$. By the
induction hypothesis each of the summands of the third term are also
zero.
\end{proof}

As a corollary, connected graded bialgebras are always Hopf, with
antipode indeed given by the geometric series~\eqref{eq:geom-series}.
One of the advantages of this formulation is that we obtain fully
explicit formulae for $S$ from the coproduct.


\begin{prop}% Proposition 2.
If $a \in H^{(n)}$, $\Delta'(a) = \sum_{j_1} a'_{j_1} \otimes a''_{j_1}$,
$\Delta'(a'_{j_1}) = \sum_{j_2} a'_{j_1j_2} \otimes a''_{j_1j_2}$, and in
general $\Delta'(a'_{"
