 \caption{The vacuum manifold in the simplest model
with twisted mass and superpotential, see (\ref{Aone}).
The target space is $S_2$ with the punctured  poles
(the poles are marked by closed circles).  The vacuum manifold consists
of two disconnected $S_1$ submanifolds. The trajectory running along a meridian
and interpolating between vacua belonging to the
first and second $S_1$ respectively 
(thick solid line) is a 1/4 BPS
saturated kink.}
