We review and compare different variational formulations for the Schr\""{o}%
dinger field. Some of them rely on the addition of a conveniently chosen
total time derivative to the hermitic Lagrangian. Alternatively, the
Dirac-Bergmann algorithm yields the Schr\""{o}dinger equation first as a
consistency condition in the full phase space, second as canonical equation
in the reduced phase space. The two methods lead to the same (reduced)
Hamiltonian. As a third possibility, the Faddeev-Jackiw method is shown to
be a shortcut of the Dirac method. By implementing the quantization scheme
for systems with second class constraints, inconsistencies of previous
treatments are eliminated.
