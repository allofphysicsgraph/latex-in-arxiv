By using the systematic approach of parent action method, we derive
the Polyakov and two Weyl-invariant actions of bosonic $p$-branes ($p\geq 2$)
starting from the Nambu-Goto action, and establish the duality symmetries
in this set of four actions. Moreover, we discover a new bosonic $p$-brane
action (including the string theory) and deduce two corresponding
Weyl-invariant formulations by proposing a new special parent action.
We find that the same duality symmetries as those mentioned above exist
in this new set of actions.
The new $p$-brane actions are also briefly analyzed.
