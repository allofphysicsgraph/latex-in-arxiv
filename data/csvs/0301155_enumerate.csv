\item The ``auxiliary'' field $F$ is promoted to an independent physical
  field. To obtain the spectrum of the theory it is not getting
  eliminated. Consequently, the spectrum of our model contains two complex
  scalars $\varphi$ and $F$ and one spinor $\psi$. $F$ is interpreted with the
  glue-ball and the new dynamical effects represent the consequence of the
  formation of a massive spectrum in the boson sector.
\item To arrive at a consistent formulation of point 1, the ``upside-down''
  potential for $F$ in the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian $V_F \propto - F
  \bar{F}$ has to be replaced. The correct potential must have a minimum in $F$
  instead of a maximum. Technically this is done by formulating the effective
  potential in terms of the two fields $\Psi_0 = (\Phi)^{\inv{3}}$ and $\Psi_1
  = \bar{D}^2 \bar{\Psi}_0$ ($\Phi$ denotes the effective glue-ball superfield).
\item The spectrum of the theory does not follow from the superpotential, but
  from the generalized K\""{a}hler potential. The superpotential as a
  holomorphic function in the fields never defines stable couplings in the
  complex fields. If the highest components of the chiral fields are
  auxiliary, stable couplings are obtained after eilimination of these
  fields. As our action does not allow this elimination, the K\""{a}hler
  potential must adopt the role of the superpotential. This is possible due to
  its the rich structure. The superpotential
  reduces to the generator of the anomalies (WZW-term) and has no dominant
  influence on the spectrum.
\item Supersymmetry breaks dynamically. There are three different ways to
  establish this result:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A strict proof of the statement follows from the symmetries of the
    effective potential: The first variation of the effective potential with respect to
    $\varphi$ is equivalent to the mass of $\psi$. Thus the mass of $\psi$ is
    identically zero in the minimum and must be interpreted as a Goldstino
    mode.
  \item The Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian has a supersymmetric maximum in
    the ``auxiliary''-field potential (the supersymmetric vacua in the
    interpretation of ref.\ \cite{veneziano82}). As the  Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian is complete up
    to order $\bar{F} F$ in the ``auxiliary''-field potential, the maximum cannot
    be turned into a minimum. Thus the minimum must be at a different
    value of $F$, $F_0 \neq 0$.
  \item $F_0 \neq 0$ plays an important role in the dynamics. Due to this
    vacuum expectation value, new terms including explicit space-time
    derivatives follow. These terms can be important to stabilize
    the dynamics around the correct ground-state.
  \end{enumerate}
  The breaking-mechanism is of essentially non-perturbative nature and is not
  excluded by different contrarian results (Instanton calculations, Witten
  index etc.).
\item Any ground-state of the effective potential can be endowed with
  stable dynamics. This includes terms of arbitrary order in the momentum
  (non-local effective action).

  \item \eqref{eq:ladd2} has no unstable terms. This follows from $F_0 > 0$
    and $\varphi_0 < 0$. On the other hand it adds stable terms to all possible combinations.
  \item $d_1$ is not constrained.
  \"
3,"\begin{enumerate}
\item Different semi-classical and/or perturbative arguments suggest that
  supersymmetry should be unbroken in SYM theories. Why don't these arguments
  exclude our solution?
\item Closely related to the first question is the behavior of the potential
  for $\varphi \rightarrow 0$ and $F \rightarrow 0$. The first limit is
  interesting in the action by Veneziano and Yankielowicz as well: There the
  bosonic potential has a second minimum for $\varphi = 0$, which led to
  speculations about a chirally symmetric minimum
  \cite{kovner97}. Do similar problems appear in our calculation?
\item We have defined our theory as an effective action obtained from a source
  extension. How does the effective action depend on these
  sources? Especially, we can study the limit of constant sources, which is
  formally identical to soft supersymmetry breaking. What happens to the
  Goldstino in this case?
\"
4,"\begin{enumerate}
\item The supersymmetric state postulated by the Witten index indeed does
  exist, but this state is not the true ground-state. This is
  consistent with all symmetries: Supersymmetry tells us, that the vacuum
  energy must be positive semi-definite. This does not mean that the effective potential
  is positive semi-definite (cf.\ section \ref{sec:vytononlocal},
  sect.\ 6.1 of \cite{bergamin01} and sect.\ 2.2.1 of \cite{bergamin02:1}).

  In this scenario the
  semi-classical analysis is an expansion around the wrong state and fails to
  capture all relevant effects. Any of our non-local models with a regular
  potential for $F \rightarrow 0$ appears as a realization of this
  situation. Trivially it exists if $(\veff)_0 <
  0$, only.
\item The supersymmetric ground-state does not exist at all. In this context it is
  important to notice that all arguments in favor of unbroken supersymmetry
  are brought forward in an infrared regularized region, either in the finite
  volume (instantons and similar, Witten index) or with a momentum cutoff
  (Wilsonian effective action). As these approaches cannot solve the
  fundamental infrared problem of non-Abelian gauge theories, but just remove
  it by brute force, we indeed expect dynamical effects not captured therein. We
  interpret these effects with the formation of the massive spectrum in the
  boson sector and the dynamics of the glue-ball. Our result suggests
  that these dynamical effects are not consistent with unbroken
  supersymmetry. But as any consistent quantum-field theory must solve the
  infrared problem by appropriate dynamical effects, the perturbatively
  supersymmetric ground-state is removed by a singularity and replaced by the
  correct one enforcing dynamical symmetry breaking.
\"
5,"\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{enum:p1}Supersymmetry is realized linearly. This is one of the basic assumptions
  made when writing down the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:vylagrangian}. But again,
  this is a statement about the whole effective action. Thus not solely
  \eqref{eq:vylagrangian}, but also $\Delta \mathcal{L}$ must be an integral
  over superspace.

  If the low energy dynamics are
  described by $\Phi$ alone (e.g.\ in a quantum effective action), higher
  derivatives on $\varphi$ and $\psi$ inevitably lead to derivative terms in $F$. When introducing
  additional fields, we could try to arrange them in such a way that all
  derivative terms in the auxiliary fields cancel (such a model has been
  derived in ref.\ \cite{gates97} as an ansatz for the effective action of
  SUSY QCD). Using this idea in pure SYM would imply that the new fields
  are not suppressed compared to $\Phi$, in contradiction to our assumption
  about the low-energy dynamics of SYM. Thus it is impossible to keep $F$
  auxiliary in a non-local Lagrangian, if the low-energy dynamics shall depend
  on the three fields $\varphi$, $\psi$ and $F$, only. 
\item \label{enum:p2}The effective action must have higher order derivative terms that are
  not present in the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian. A local effective
  action is not acceptable for an interacting theory.

  Besides this general objection a careful analysis within the supersymmetric
  framework shows that the locality of supersymmetric non-linear sigma models
  is not just a harmless peculiarity when using them in effective
  descriptions. Indeed, the low energy spectrum should include the glue-ball. The only candidate for a
  glue-ball operator is $F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}$, the real part of $F$. If
  $F$ remains auxiliary we have to assume that the glue-ball of $N=1$ SYM does not
  belong to the relevant low-energy degrees of freedom. Even if this
  assumption is correct the relation to pure YM theory remains
  mysterious. If the low-energy dynamics shall be described in terms of
  renormalizable operators (or their classical fields, resp.)\ pure YM theory
  does generate non-trivial dynamics for $F_{\mu \nu}
  F^{\mu \nu}$ and we are left with the unsatisfactory situation that either
  the two classical fields $\bra{\Omega(J)} F_{\mu \nu}
  F^{\mu \nu} \ket{\Omega(J)}_{\mbox{\tiny{SYM}}}$ and $\bra{\Omega(J)} F_{\mu \nu}
  F^{\mu \nu} \ket{\Omega(J)}_{\mbox{\tiny{YM}}}$ are completely independent objects
  or that
    there exists a phase transition in the decoupling of the gluino by giving
    it a heavy mass (its origin and consequences have been discussed in
    \cite{bergamin01}). It has been tried to escape this restriction by the
    choice of a more complicated geometry than realized in
    \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} \cite{farrar98}. From our point of view the result
    of \cite{farrar98} cannot lead to a resolution of the problem
    \cite{bergamin01}. Moreover, trying to add higher order derivatives to the
  action of \cite{farrar98} leads to the same complications as discussed in
  this work for the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian and their resolution  automatically leads to the inclusion of the glue-ball dynamics (see
  next section). Thus the construction of \cite{farrar98} becomes redundant in
  the context of non-local actions.
\"
6,"\begin{enumerate}
\item The full potential is not positive semi-definite: Obviously the
  positivity of the potential holds after elimination of the auxiliary fields,
  only. The statement that supersymmetric potentials are always positive
  semi-definite is actually a statement about the maximum of the auxiliary
  field potential: The latter is zero (unbroken supersymmetry) or positive
  (broken supersymmetry). As this maximum does no longer represent the ground
  state in a theory with dynamical ``auxiliary'' fields, the physical potential
  can have a negative minimum. This has important consequences in the
  discussion of supersymmetry breaking: In classical and perturbative
  supersymmetry a supersymmetric state (i.e. a state with vanishing potential) is automatically the ground-state and
  implies unbroken supersymmetry. In the non-perturbative region this
  conclusion does not hold, as the ``auxiliary'' fields become dynamical.
\item While the potential is not necessarily positive, the restriction on the
  vacuum energy still holds: $\lomega T_{\mu \nu} \romega = g_{\mu \nu} E_0
  \geq 0$ due to supersymmetry current-algebra relations \cite{salam74}. $E_0
  > 0$ implies supersymmetry breaking, while $E_0 = 0$ means
  unbroken supersymmetry. In a strictly perturbative and/or semiclassical
  logic a strict relation between the minimum of the effective potential and
  the order parameter $E_0$ exists: $(\veff)_0 \equiv E_0$ due to the
  non-renormalization theorem. In a fully non-perturbative framework an
  extension of this relation to $(\veff)_0 \neq 0$, $E_0 \neq 0$ but
  $(\veff)_0 \neq E_0$ is possible. A consistent relation of this form can
  be achieved only by a non-perturbative extension of the trace anomaly
  \eqref{eq:anomcurrent}\footnote{In this paper we do not provide such an extension.}.
  But in any case the order parameter of
  supersymmetry breaking is still $E_0$ and in the effective theory the
  latter is represented by the value of
  $F$ in the ground-state.
\item Supersymmetry breaks dynamically. Interestingly enough this follows directly
  from \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} and \eqref{eq:vyonshell}: The unstable maximum
  is at the supersymmetry preserving point (vanishing potential and $F = 0$). As the
  action \eqref{eq:vylagrangian} is complete up to order
  $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda^{-4})$, the unstable maximum cannot turn directly into
  a minimum (stability of $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ forbids to choose $a<0$ in \eqref{eq:vylagrangian}). Instead, the new minimum must be at a different value of $F$:
  $F_0 \neq 0$. But $F$ is the order parameter of supersymmetry breaking and
  we arrive at the desired result. The argument of \cite{veneziano82} that
  supersymmetry is unbroken in $N=1$ SYM thus turns into the opposite when
  taking into account all (including non-local) terms.
