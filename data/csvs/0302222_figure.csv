\caption{Sketch of the potential (lower figure) and phase space in a
model of small field inflation. The region which leads to successful
slow roll inflation lies between the the lower and upper diagonal
curves $\gamma_l$ and $\gamma_u$ in the upper left quadrant. 
The symbols are defined in the text.}

with initial conditions such that $\tQ$ is $-1$ and its time derivative 0 at the initial time when $\phi = 0.2 m_{pl}$, after slow rolling has ended. Time is expressed in units of $m^{-1}$.}
