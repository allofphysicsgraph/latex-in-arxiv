We consider in the Randall-Sundrum scenario the dynamics of
a spherically symmetric 3-brane world when matter fields exist in the
bulk. We determine exact 5-dimensional solutions which
localize gravity near the brane and
describe the dynamics of homogeneous polytropic matter on the
brane. We show that these geometries are associated with a well
defined conformal class of
bulk matter fields. We analyze the effective polytropic dynamics
on the brane identifying conditions which define it as singular or
as globally regular.
