\noindent 
We show how a large class of boundary RG flows in 
two-dimensional conformal field theories can be summarized in a single rule.
This rule is a generalization of the 
'absorption of the boundary spin'-principle of Affleck and Ludwig and 
applies to all theories which have a description as a coset model. 
We give a formulation for coset models with arbitrary modular 
invariant partition function and present evidence for the conjectured rule.
The second half of the
article contains an illustrated section of examples where the
rule is applied to unitary minimal models of the A- and D-series, in
particular the 3-state Potts model, and to parafermion theories. We
demonstrate how the rule can be used to compute brane charge groups in
the example of $N=2$ minimal models.
