\vspace{5mm}

Renormalization group evolution of QCD composite light-cone operators, built from
two and more quark and gluon fields, is responsible for the logarithmic scaling
violations in diverse physical observables. We analyze spectra of anomalous
dimensions of these operators at large conformal spins at weak and strong
coupling with the emphasis on the emergence of a dual string picture. The
multi-particle spectrum at weak coupling has a hidden symmetry due to
integrability of the underlying dilatation operator which drives the evolution.
In perturbative regime, we demonstrate the equivalence of the one-loop cusp
anomaly to the disk partition function in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory which
admits a string representation. The strong coupling regime for anomalous
dimensions is discussed within the two pictures addressed recently, --- minimal
surfaces of open strings and rotating long closed strings in AdS background. In
the latter case we find that the integrability implies the presence of extra
degrees of freedom -- the string junctions. We demonstrate how the analysis of
their equations of motion naturally agrees with the spectrum found at weak
coupling.

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The formalism of path-ordered exponentials, or Wilson loops, is an indispensable
tool in QCD. It allows one to formulate complicated QCD dynamics in terms of
gauge invariant degrees of freedom \cite{Pol80} and express correlation functions
as a sum over random walks, e.g.,
\be
\vev{0|J_\mu(x) J_\nu(0)|0}
=
\sum_C \e^{- m \, L[C]} {\mit\Phi}_{\mu\nu}[C]
\ \vev{0| \tr P \exp \lr{i\oint_C dx_\mu A^\mu(x)} |0}
\, ,
\label{corr-func}
\ee
where $J_\mu(x) = \widebar {\mit\Psi} (x) \gamma_\mu {\mit\Psi} (x)$ is the
electromagnetic current of a quark with mass $m$. $L[C]$ is the length of a
closed path $C = C [0,x]$ that passes through the points $x$ and $0$.
${\mit\Phi}_{\mu\nu}[C]$ is a geometrical phase, the so-called Polyakov spin
factor, that takes into account the variation of the quark spin upon parallel
transport along the path $C$. To evaluate \re{corr-func}, one has to calculate
the (nonperturbative) expectation value of the Wilson loop for an arbitrary path
$C$ and perform resummation in the right-hand side of \re{corr-func}. Both tasks
are extremely difficult and can not be performed in full at the current stage.
Recently, a significant progress has been achieved in understanding the strong
coupling dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories \cite{Mal98,EriSemZar00}
based on the gauge/string correspondence \cite{Mal97,GunKlePol98,Wit98}. One of
the goals of the present paper is to establish a relation between certain QCD
observables and their counterparts in string theory.

There exists a special class of QCD observables, for which the sum
over paths in the right-hand side of \re{corr-func} can be
performed exactly. As a relevant physical example, let us consider
a propagation of an energetic quark through a cloud of soft
gluons. In the limit when its energy goes to infinity, the quark
behaves as a point-like charged particle that moves along a straight
line and interacts with soft gluons. This means that the sum over
all paths in \re{corr-func} is dominated in that case by a saddle
point describing a propagation of a quark along its classical
path. The Wilson loop corresponding to this path has the meaning
of the eikonal phase acquired by the quark field upon interaction
with gluons. In this way, the Wilson loop encodes universal
features of soft radiation in QCD. Let us point out two important
QCD observables, in which similar semiclassical regime occurs: the
Isgur-Wise heavy-meson form factor, $\xi(\theta)$, and parton
distributions in a hadron, $f(x)$, at the edge of the phase space,
$x\to 1$. As we will demonstrate below, both observables are given
by an expectation value of a Wilson loop with the integration
contour $C$ fixed by the kinematics of the process. A unique
feature of the contour $C$ is that it contains a few cusps at points
in Minkowski space-time where the interaction with a large momentum
has occured in the underlying process.

In this way, Wilson loops with cusps, being fundamental objects in gauge
theories, have a direct relevance for QCD phenomenology. Their calculation in the
strong coupling (nonperturbative) regime is one of the prominent problems in
gauge theories. In the present paper, we make use of a recent progress in
understanding the strong coupling behavior of the ${\cal N} = 4$ supersymmetric
(SUSY) Yang-Mills (YM) theory to get some insights into properties of Wilson
loops in QCD. Our analysis relies on the gauge/string duality between
${\cal N} = 4$ SUSY gauge theory and a string theory on AdS$_5\times$S$^5$
background \cite{Mal97,GunKlePol98,Wit98}.%
\footnote{Note that recently there were several studies which aimed on the
derivation of strong coupling results for high-energy QCD observables, most
notably Refs.~\cite{GubKlePol02,DruGroOog99,Kru02,Mak02,JanPes00,PolSus01,GorKogKor02}.}
A natural question arises: what is in common between QCD and ${\cal N} = 4$
SUSY Yang-Mills theory? The two theories have quite different dynamics at
large distances, while at short distances they have many features in common.
For instance, anomalous dimensions of twist-two operators, contributing to
high-energy QCD processes, have a similar form in two theories including their
behavior at large Lorentz spin. Having this relation in mind, we will study
expressions for resummed anomalous dimensions in the ${\cal N} = 4$
SUSY Yang-Mills theory.%
\footnote{Since the anomalous dimensions originate from short distances,
we find it appropriate to refer to them in the strong coupling regime as
resummed anomalous dimensions rather then nonperturbative ones.}

We concentrate on two observations relevant to our present discussion. Recently,
it was proposed that anomalous dimensions of twist-two composite operators with
large Lorentz spin $J$ are equal in the strong coupling limit to the ``Energy
$-$ Spin'' of  a folded closed string rotating in AdS${}_5$ and having the shape
of a long rigid rod (mimicking the adjoint QCD string of glue with heavy quarks
at the folding points) \cite{GubKlePol02}
\be
\gamma_J(\alpha_s) = E - J
= 2 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}} \, \ln J +
\mathcal{O}(J^0)
\, .
\label{GKP}
\ee
Another observation comes from the calculation of the Wilson loop in the strong
coupling regime via the minimal surface, $\mathcal{A}_{\rm min}$, swept by an
open string which goes into the fifth AdS dimension and whose ends trace its
contour in Minkowski space \cite{Mal98}. This picture naturally embeds the color
flux tubes between the color sources, albeit penetrating into an extra Liouville
dimension \cite{Pol98} as compared to the conventional four-dimensional setup.
{}From the QCD perspective, one is mostly interested in calculating Wilson loops
with cusps. Such contours were considered in a number of studies
\cite{DruGroOog99,Kru02,Mak02}. For the ${\scriptstyle \Pi}$-shaped Wilson loop
with two cusps (see Eq.~\re{W-DIS} below) the result reads \cite{Kru02,Mak02}
\be
W( v\!\cdot\!n \,\xi \mu)
=
\exp(i {\cal A}_{\rm min})
\, , \qquad
{\cal A}_{\rm min}
=
i \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}} \ln^2 (i v\!\cdot\!n \, \xi\mu)
\, .
\label{W-min}
\ee
Comparing \re{GKP} and \re{W-min}, one notices that $\gamma_J$ and $A_{\rm min}$
depend on the coupling constant in the same manner. The coincidence is not
accidental, of course. Identifying $\sqrt{\alpha_s}$-factor as the leading term
in the expression for the {\sl cusp anomalous dimension}
\be
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s) = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}} +
\mathcal{O}((\sqrt{\alpha_s})^0)
\, ,
\label{cusp-strong}
\ee
one can show that Eqs.~\re{GKP} and \re{W-min} hold in a conformal gauge
theory for arbitrary coupling constant~\cite{KorMar93}. Eq.~\re{cusp-strong}
defines the asymptotic behavior of ${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s)$ in
the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SUSY YM theory in the strong coupling regime.

In the present paper, we will extend these results to composite QCD operators
of higher twist, built from an arbitrary number of fields and having autonomous
renormalization scale evolution. Such operators are known in QCD as
multi-particle conformal operators. We determine the spectrum of their anomalous
dimensions at large Lorentz spins, $J \gg 1$, both in weak and strong coupling
regimes. At weak coupling, the spectrum has a hidden symmetry due to
integrability of the dilatation operator in the underlying Yang-Mills theory. At
strong coupling, the two different pictures, --- the rotating folded long string
and the minimal surface swept by an open string with ends attached to the cusp,
--- result into the same asymptotic expression for the anomalous dimension of
conformal operators. We argue that integrability at weak coupling implies the
presence of extra stringy degrees of freedom at strong coupling, --- the string
junctions, --- and elucidate the relation between the anomalous dimensions of
multi-particle conformal operators at strong coupling and solutions to the
classical equations of motion for the string junctions.

To sew together the expressions for the anomalous dimensions at weak and strong
coupling, one needs the stringy description of the weak coupling regime in
Yang-Mills theory. One approach to the derivation of such stringy picture, based
on the hidden integrability of evolution equations for the light-cone operators,
has been developed in \cite{GorKogKor02}. It relies on the identification of the
underlying Yang-Mills dilatation operator as the Hamiltonian of
$SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Heisenberg spin chain. The $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group naturally
appears in this context as a subgroup of the four-dimensional conformal group
acting on the light-cone. Due to complete integrability of the spin chain model,
the spectrum of the anomalous dimensions of multi-particle light-cone operators
can be found exactly in terms of the Riemann surfaces whose genus is related to
the number of the particles involved. As a consequence, the twist expansion on
the light-cone was shown to correspond to the summation over the genera of the
corresponding Riemann surfaces.



Our consequent presentation is organized as follows. In section~2 we review the
relation of certain QCD observables to expectation values of Wilson lines and
elucidate the physical meaning of the cusp anomaly. We also give there results
for the two-loop cusp anomalous dimensions in supersymmetric theories. In section
\ref{ConformalOp}, we turn to multi-particle operators and show how conformal
symmetry in gauge theory simplifies the problem of finding the spectrum of their
anomalous dimensions. We demonstrate the way the integrability of the evolution
equations arises through the identification of the underlying dilatation operator
with the Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg spin chain. In the subsequent section we
address the stringy interpretation of the gauge theory results. Our analysis
suggests that the cusp anomaly at weak coupling is described by a string which is
different from the Nambu-Goto string. To identify this string we show that the
cusp anomalous dimension to one-loop order is equal to the transition amplitude
for a test particle on the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group manifold, which in its turn
is given by the partition function of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on a disk
which admits a stringy representation. Next, in section \ref{StrongCoupling}, we
discuss the strong coupling computation within the open and closed string theory
context for multi-particle operators extending earlier results. Section~6
contains concluding remarks. In the appendix, we calculate the contribution of
vacuum polarization to the two-loop cusp anomaly in dimensional regularization
and dimensional reduction schemes.

\section{Wilson loops as QCD observables}
\label{QCDptTheory}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As was emphasized in the introduction, there are several QCD
observables directly related to expectation values of Wilson
lines.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Isgur-Wise form factor}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Isgur-Wise form factor $\xi(\theta)$ describes the electromagnetic transition
of a heavy meson $|M (v) \rangle$ with mass $m$ and momentum $p_\mu \equiv m
v_\mu$, built from a heavy quark and a light component, to the same meson with
momentum $p'_\mu \equiv m v'_\mu$ (with $v_\mu^2 = {v'_\mu}^2 = 1$)
\cite{IsgWis90}
\begin{equation}
\label{IsgurWise}
\langle M (v') |
\widebar {\mit\Psi} (0) \gamma_\mu {\mit\Psi} (0)
| M (v) \rangle
=
\xi ( \theta ) (v + v')_\mu
\, .
\end{equation}
In the heavy-quark limit, $m\to \infty$, it depends only on the product of
velocities $v' \!\cdot\! v = \cosh \theta$, or equivalently on the angle
$\theta$ between them in Minkowski space-time. The operator ${\mit\Psi} (0)$
annihilates the heavy quark inside the meson $| M (v) \rangle$. For $m \to
\infty$, the heavy quark behaves as a classical particle with the velocity
$v_\mu$ interacting with the light component of the meson through its eikonal
current, $J^{a,{\rm eik}}_\mu (x) = \int_{-\infty}^0 d \tau\, v_\mu t^a
\delta^{(4)}(x-v\tau)$ with $t^a$ being the quark color charge. This allows one
to replace
\be
{\mit\Psi} (x) \rightarrow \e^{-im (v\cdot x)} b_v \, {\mit\Phi}_v [x; -
\infty]
\, , \qquad
{\mit\Phi}_v [x; - \infty] \equiv P \exp \left( i \int_{-\infty}^0 d \tau \, v
\cdot A (x + v \tau)
\right)\,,
\label{Phi-app}
\ee
where ${\mit\Phi}_v [x;-\infty]$ is the eikonal phase of a heavy quark in the
fundamental representation of the $SU(N_c)$ and $b_v$ amputates this quark inside
the heavy meson. Applying similar transformation to the quark field in the final
state meson $| M (v')
\rangle$, one obtains the following expression for the form factor
\cite{KorRad93}
\begin{equation}
\xi ( \theta )
=
\langle \widetilde{M}(v') |
{\mit\Phi}_{v'} [ \infty ; 0 ] {\mit\Phi}_v [ 0 ; - \infty ]
| \widetilde{M}(v) \rangle
\equiv
\vev{P \exp\lr{i \oint_{\wedge} dx_\mu A^\mu(x)}}
\,,
\label{W}
\end{equation}
with $| \widetilde{M}(v) \rangle = b_v | M (v) \rangle$ standing for the light
component of the meson with the amputated heavy quark. Here the net effect of
nonperturbative interaction with the light component of the heavy meson is
accumulated only via the Wilson line%
\footnote{Representing the ``brown-muck"" of the heavy meson by a wave
function $| M_\ell \rangle = \int d^3 k \, \phi (k) \, a^\dagger_k | 0
\rangle$, the transition of the light cloud from the initial to the
final state can be described by an exact light-quark propagator in an
external gluon field. In this manner the Isgur-Wise form factor will be
rewritten as a correlation function of Wilson loop along the contour formed
by the straight-line trajectories of heavy quarks and the phase of the light
spectator quark in the world-line expression of its propagator \cite{Pol88}.}
evaluated along the contour consisting of two rays that run along the meson
velocities $v_\mu$ and $v'_\mu$. It is important to notice that the contour
has a cusp at the point $0$, in which the interaction with the external probe
has occurred.

The Isgur-Wise form factor $\xi(\theta)$ is a nonperturbative observable in QCD.
It depends on hadronic, long-distance scales as well as on the ultraviolet
cut-off $\mu\sim m$, which sets up the maximal energy of soft gluons. Although
$\xi(\theta)$ can not be calculated at present in QCD from the first principles,
its dependence on $\mu$ can be found from the renormalization group equation
\begin{equation}
\left(
\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial\mu}
+
\beta (g) \frac{\partial}{\partial g}
+ {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\theta; \alpha_s)
\right) \xi ( \theta ) = 0 \, ,
\label{RG}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_s = g^2/(4 \pi)$ is the QCD coupling constant and
${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\theta; \alpha_s)$ is the cusp anomalous dimension
\cite{Pol80,KorRad86}. To the lowest order in $\alpha_s$
\begin{equation}
\label{GammaCusp}
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\theta; \alpha_s) =
\frac{\alpha_s C_F}{\pi}
\left( \theta \coth \theta - 1 \right)
+ \mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)
\, ,
\end{equation}
where $C_F = (N_c^2 - 1)/(2N_c)$ is the Casimir operator of the $SU(N_c)$ group
in the fundamental representation. The two-loop correction to \re{GammaCusp} has
been calculated in \cite{KorRad86} and its dependence on $\theta$ is more involved.

Eq.\ \re{RG} follows from renormalization properties of the Wilson
line in the right-hand side of \re{W}. It acquires the anomalous
dimension due to the presence of a cusp on the integration
contour. The cusp anomalous dimension ${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}
(\theta; \alpha_s)$  determines universal features of soft-gluon
radiation and is known as the {\sl QCD bremsstrahlung function\/}.
As such, it is a positive definite function of the cusp angle (for
real Minkowski angle $\theta$) at arbitrary value of the coupling
constant
\be
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\theta; \alpha_s)
\ge 0\,.
\label{pos}
\ee
To see this we recall that at the cusp point the heavy quark
suddenly changes its velocity from $v_\mu$ to $v'_\mu$ and, due to
instantaneous acceleration, it starts to emit  soft (virtual and
real) gluons with momentum $k<\mu$ with a cut-off $\mu\sim m$.
Denoting the eikonal phase of the heavy quark as ${\mit\Phi}
\equiv {\mit\Phi}_{v'} [\infty ; 0 ] {\mit\Phi}_v [ 0 ; - \infty
]$ and using its unitarity, one calculates the total probability
for the heavy quark to undergo the scattering (the Bjorken sum
rule) as
\be
1
=
\vev{ \widetilde{M}(v)| {\mit\Phi}^\dagger {\mit\Phi} |\widetilde{M}(v)}
=
|\xi (\theta)|^2
+
\sum_X
\left|
\vev{\widetilde{M}_X(v')| {\mit\Phi} |\widetilde{M}(v)}
\right|^2
\, ,
\label{unitarity}
\ee
where in the right-hand side we inserted the decomposition of the unity operator
over the physical hadronic states and separated the contribution of the ground
state meson, $\ket{\widetilde{M}(v)}$, from excited states
$\ket{\widetilde{M}_X(v)}$. The Wilson line \re{W} defines the probability of the
elastic transition, $|\xi|^2\sim\exp(-w)$ with $w = 2\int^\mu (d k/k) \,
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\theta; \alpha_s(k))$. For $\theta\neq 0$, depending on
the sign of ${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\theta;\alpha_s)$, it either vanishes or
goes to infinity for $\mu \to \infty$. In order to preserve the unitarity
condition $|\xi|^2 \le 1$ that follows from \re{unitarity}, one has to require
that $\xi\to 0$ for $\mu \to \infty$ leading to \re{pos}. At $\theta = 0$ the
cusp vanishes, that is the heavy meson stays intact, the sum in \re{unitarity}
equals zero and $\xi(\theta=0) = 1$. This implies that the cusp anomalous
dimension vanishes for $\theta \to 0$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Parton distributions at $x \to 1$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our second example is provided by deeply inelastic scattering of a hadron $H(p)$
with momentum $p_\mu$ off a virtual photon $\gamma^*(q)$ with momentum $- q_\mu^2
= Q^2\gg p^2$ in the exclusive limit $x_{\rm Bj} = Q^2/(2p \cdot q) \to 1$, i.e.\
when the invariant mass of the final state system becomes small $(q + p)^2
\ll Q^2$. In the scaling limit, $Q^2 \to \infty$, the cross
section of the process is expressed in terms of the twist-two
quark distribution function \cite{ColSop82}, see also Ref.\
\cite{BelJiYua02},
\begin{equation}
\label{CollinearPDFs}
f (x)
=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d \xi}{2 \pi} \,
{\rm e}^{- i \, x \, \xi}
\langle H(p) |
\widebar {\mit\Psi} (\xi n) {\mit\Gamma} {\mit\Phi}_n [ \xi ; 0 ] {\mit\Psi} (0)
| H(p) \rangle
\, ,
\end{equation}
describing the probability to find a quark inside the hadron with the fraction
$x$ of its momentum $p$. The Wilson line stretched in between the quark fields
makes the bilocal operator gauge invariant. It goes along the light-like
direction $n_\mu = (q_\mu +p_\mu x_{\rm Bj})/(p\!\cdot\!q)$, so that $n^2=0$ and
$n\!\cdot\!p = 1$.

The matrix ${\mit\Gamma} = {\not\!n}$ in \re{CollinearPDFs} serves to select the
quark states with opposite helicities. For our purposes, we will not specify
${\mit\Gamma}$ and treat it as a free parameter. The Mellin moments of the
distribution function \re{CollinearPDFs} are related to the matrix elements of
local twist-two operators
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 d x \, x^J f (x; \mu^2)
= \langle H(p) |
\widebar {\mit\Psi} (0)
{\mit\Gamma} \left( i \, n \!\cdot\! {\cal D} \right)^J
{\mit\Psi} (0)
| H(p) \rangle
\equiv \langle {\cal O}_J^{\mit\Gamma} (\mu^2)\rangle
\, ,
\label{O}
\end{equation}
where ${\cal D}_\mu=\partial_\mu-iA_\mu$ is a covariant derivative. Their
dependence on the ultraviolet cut-off $\mu$ is described by an evolution
equation, whose solution reads in terms of the anomalous dimensions
\begin{equation}
\langle {\cal O}_J^{\, \mit\Gamma} (\mu^2)  \rangle
=
\left( \mu / \mu_0 \right)^{-\gamma_J^{\,\mit\Gamma} (\alpha_s)}
\langle {\cal O}_J^{\,\mit\Gamma} (\mu_0^2) \rangle
\,,
\label{O-sol}
\end{equation}
where we assumed for simplicity that the coupling constant does not run, $\beta =
0$. The anomalous dimension of the twist-two operators, $\gamma_J^{\mit\Gamma}
(\alpha_s)$, depends on the choice of the matrix ${\mit\Gamma}$. In particular,
in case when ${\mit\Gamma}$ selects the same helicities of the quark fields in \re{O},
${\mit\Gamma} = (1 + \gamma_5) {\not\!n} \gamma_\perp$, the anomalous dimension is
\begin{equation}
\label{AnomalousDimension}
\gamma_J(\alpha_s)
=
\frac{\alpha_s}{\pi} C_F
\Big( 2 \psi (J + 2) + 2 \gamma_{\rm E} - 3/2 \Big)
+ \mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)
\, ,
\label{psi-func}
\end{equation}
where $\psi (J) = d \ln {\mit\Gamma} (J)/d J$ is the Euler
psi-function and $\gamma_{\rm E}$ is the Euler constant. For other
choices of ${\mit\Gamma}$, the anomalous dimensions have extra
(rational in $J$) terms in addition to the $\psi$-function, see,
e.g., \cite{BukFroKurLip85}. As we will argue below, Eq.\
\re{psi-func} has a hidden symmetry which is responsible for
integrability of evolution equations for three-quark (baryonic)
composite operators. Going over to the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SUSY
Yang-Mills theory, one finds that the same expression
\re{psi-func} defines (up to redefinition of the color factor $C_F
\to N_c$) the anomalous dimensions of multiplicatively
renormalizable twist-two operators \cite{KotLip}.

As follows from \re{O}, the asymptotics of the distribution function for
$x \to 1$ is related to the contribution of twist-two operators of large
Lorentz spins $J \sim 1/(1 - x) \gg 1$. One finds from \re{AnomalousDimension}
that the anomalous dimension scales in this limit as
\be
\gamma_{J} (\alpha_s) = \frac{\alpha_s}{\pi} C_F
\left\{
\ln (J+2) + \gamma_{\rm E} - 3/4 - \frac{1}{2 (J+2)}
- \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{B_{2n}}{2n} (J+2)^{- 2 n}
\right\}
+ \ldots
\,,
\label{gamma-exp}
\ee
where $B_{n}$'s are the Bernoulli numbers, $B_2 = 1/6$, $B_4 = -1/30, \, \dots$,
and the ellipsis stands for higher order terms in $\alpha_s$. It turns out that
the leading scaling behavior $\gamma_J^{\mit\Gamma} (\alpha_s) \sim \ln J$ is a
universal property of the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two operators \re{O}
for arbitrary ${\mit\Gamma}$. It holds to all orders in $\alpha_s$ and is
intrinsically related to the cusp anomaly of the Wilson loops. The reason for
this is that analyzing deeply inelastic scattering for $x \to 1$ one encounters
the same physical phenomenon as in the case of the Isgur-Wise form factor, i.e.\
the struck quark carries almost the whole momentum of the hadron and, therefore,
it interacts with other partons by exchanging soft gluons. In these circumstances,
in complete analogy to the previous case, Eq.\ \re{Phi-app}, the quark field
can be approximated by an eikonal phase evaluated along the classical path in
the direction of its velocity $p_\mu = m v_\mu$,
\begin{equation}
\label{LargeX}
f (x)
=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{d \xi}{2 \pi}
{\rm e}^{i(1 - x) \, \xi}
\langle \widetilde{H}(p) |
W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} ( {v \!\cdot\! n} \, \xi \mu -i0) | \widetilde{H}(p) \rangle
\, ,
\end{equation}
where $| \widetilde{H}(p) \rangle$ is the state of the target hadron with
amputated energetic quark and the causal $-i0$ prescription ensures the correct
spectral property, $f (x) = 0$ for $ x > 1$. The ${\scriptstyle \Pi}$-shaped
Wilson line in Eq.\ (\ref{LargeX}) consists out of two rays and one segment:
a link from $- \infty$ to $0$ along the velocity of the incoming quark, next
along the light-cone direction $n_\mu$ to the point $\xi n_\mu $ and, then,
along $- v_\mu$ from $0$ to $\infty$,
\begin{equation}
W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} ({v \!\cdot\! n} \, \xi\mu )
=
{\mit\Phi}^\dagger_v [ \xi ; - \infty ]\,
{\mit\Phi}_n [ \xi ; 0 ]\, {\mit\Phi}_v [ 0 ; - \infty ]
\, .
\label{W-DIS}
\end{equation}
Substituting \re{LargeX} into \re{O}, one finds the following relation between
the matrix elements of local composite operators at large spin $J$ and the Wilson
loop expectation value~\cite{KorMar93}
\begin{equation}
\langle{\cal O}_J^{\,\mit\Gamma} (\mu^2) \rangle
=
\langle \widetilde{H}(p) |
W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} ( - i J )
| \widetilde{H}(p)  \rangle
\equiv\vev{P\exp\lr{i\int_{\scriptstyle\Pi} dx_\mu A^\mu(x)}}
\, .
\label{O-W}
\end{equation}
Here, the large Lorentz spin of the local operator defines the length
of the light-cone segment:
\begin{equation}
\label{JtoTheta}
{v \!\cdot\! n} \, \xi \, \mu \to - i J
\, .
\end{equation}
We would like to stress that Eq.~\re{O-W} holds only for $J \gg 1$.

According to Eq.~\re{O-W}, the $\mu$-dependence of the twist-two operators
follows from the renormalization of the Wilson line \re{W-DIS}. The latter has
two cusps located at the points $0$ and $\xi n_\mu$. In distinction with the
previous case, one of the segments attached to the cusps lies on the light-cone,
$n^2 = 0$, and the corresponding cusp angle is infinite, $\theta\sim \frac12
\ln[ (v \!\cdot\! n)^2/n^2] \to \infty$. In this limit, the cusp anomalous
dimension scales to all orders in $\alpha_s$ as \cite{KorRad86}
\begin{equation}
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\theta; \alpha_s) =
\theta \, {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s) + \mathcal{O}(\theta^0)
\,.
\label{light-cusp}
\end{equation}
Here ${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)$ is a universal anomalous dimension
independent on $\theta$. At weak coupling, it has the following form in QCD
\be
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)
=
\frac{\alpha_s}{\pi}C_F
+
\lr{\frac{\alpha_s}{\pi}}^2 C_F
\left\{
N_c \lr{\frac{67}{36} - \frac{\pi^2}{12}} - n_f \frac5{18}\right\}
+
\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)
\,,
\label{two-loop}
\ee
where $n_f$ is the number of quark flavors. This expression was obtained
within the dimensional regularization scheme (DREG) by using the
$\widebar{\textrm{MS}}$-subtraction procedure, $\alpha_s \equiv
\alpha_s^{_{\widebar{\rm MS}}}$.

The divergence of the anomalous dimension \re{light-cusp} for $\theta\to\infty$
indicates that the Wilson line with a light-like segment satisfies an evolution
equation different from \re{RG}. The modified equation looks like \cite{KorMar93}
\begin{equation}
\left(
\mu \frac{\partial}{\partial\mu}
+
\beta (g) \frac{\partial}{\partial g}
+
2 {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s) \ln[ i (v \!\cdot\! n) \, \xi \mu]
+
{\mit\Gamma} (\alpha_s)
\right)
\vev{ W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} ( {v \!\cdot\! n} \, \xi \mu) }
=
0
\, .
\label{RG-light}
\end{equation}
Here the factor of 2 stems from the presence of two cusps on the ${\scriptstyle
\Pi}$-shaped line contour and ${\mit\Gamma} (\alpha_s)$ is a process-dependent
anomalous dimension. The explicit dependence of the anomalous dimensions on
the renormalization scale $\mu$ implies the absence of the multiplicative
renormalizability of the light-like Wilson line. Combining together Eqs.\
\re{RG-light} and \re{O-W}, we obtain the renormalization group equation for
local composite operators $\langle{\cal O}_J^{\,\mit\Gamma}(\mu^2) \rangle$
at large $J$. Matching its solution into \re{O-sol}, we find the asymptotic
behavior of the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two quark operators for
$J \to \infty$
\begin{equation}
\gamma_J^{(qq)} (\alpha_s)
= 2 {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s) \ln J + {\cal O} (J^0)
\,.
\label{gamma-as}
\end{equation}
Repeating a similar analysis for the twist-two gluon operators, one can show that
their matrix elements satisfy \re{O-W} with the Wilson line defined in the
adjoint representation. Therefore, their anomalous dimension satisfies
\re{gamma-as} upon replacing $C_F\to N_c$ leading to~\cite{KorMar93}
\be
\gamma_J^{(gg)} (\alpha_s)
=
\frac{N_c}{C_F} \, \gamma_J^{(qq)} (\alpha_s)
+
{\cal O} (J^0)
\, .
\ee
In general, the quark and gluon operators mix with each other. However, at large
$J$ the mixing occurs through the exchange of a soft quark with momentum $\sim
1/J$. Its contribution to the corresponding anomalous dimensions is suppressed by
a power of $1/J$ leading to
\be
\gamma_J^{(gq)} (\alpha_s) = {\cal O}(1/J)
\, , \qquad
\gamma_J^{(qg)} (\alpha_s) = {\cal O}(1/J)
\, .
\label{off-diag}
\ee
We would like to stress that the relations \re{gamma-as}--\re{off-diag} are valid
to all orders in $\alpha_s$. Remarkably enough, they hold both in QCD and its
supersymmetric extensions. In the latter case, the mixing matrix has a bigger
size due to the presence of additional scalar fields. Nevertheless, this matrix
remains diagonal at large $J$. Since the fields in supersymmetric YM theories
belong to the adjoint representation, the diagonal matrix elements are the same
\be
\gamma_J^{(ab)}
=
2 \delta_{ab} \mit{\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s) \ln J
+
\mathcal{O}(J^0)
\, .
\ee
with $a,b=(q,g,s)$. However, one can not use for
$\mit{\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)$ the two-loop expression
\re{two-loop} at $C_F=N_c$, because it was obtained within the
dimensional regularization scheme which breaks supersymmetry and
also lacks the contribution of possible scalars.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cusp anomaly in supersymmetric theories}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To calculate ${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)$ in a supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory, we use the regularization by dimensional reduction (DRED)
\cite{Sie79,CapJonNie80,Sie80}. In analogy to compactification, one gets this
scheme by dimensionally reducing the four-dimensional theory down to $d = 4 - 2
\varepsilon < 4$ dimensions. In comparison with the DREG scheme, the Lagrangian
involves now the so-called epsilon-scalars generated by $2 \varepsilon$
components of the four-dimensional gauge field. To two-loop accuracy, these
scalar fields contribute to the Wilson loop by modifying the self-energy of a
gluon at the level of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ corrections. The calculation of
the corresponding Feynman diagram is straightforward and details can be found in
the Appendix \ref{DRED}. It leads to the two-loop correction $-
\lr{{\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}}}/{\pi}}^2 C_F N_c/12$ to
the right-hand side of \re{two-loop}, resulting into
\be
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}
=
\frac{\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}}}{\pi} N_c
+
\left(
\frac{\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}}}{\pi}
\right)^2
N_c
\left\{
N_c \left( \frac{16}{9} - \frac{\pi^2}{12} \right)
-
n_f \frac{5}{18} - n_s \frac{1}{9}
\right\}
+
\mathcal{O}
\left(
(\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}})^3
\right)
\, ,
\label{two-loop-DR}
\ee
where $\alpha_s=\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}}$ is the
coupling constant in the DRED scheme with modified minimal subtractions. Here, in
comparison with \re{two-loop}, we added the contribution of $n_s = N_s N_c$ real
scalars and set $C_F = N_c$ since in a supersymmetic gauge theory fields belong
to the adjoint representation of the $SU (N_c)$. Notice that one can obtain the
same expression \re{two-loop-DR} by expanding \re{two-loop} in powers of the
coupling constant in the dimensional reduction scheme, $\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{
\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}}$, which is related to the coupling constant in the
dimensional regularization scheme, $\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle
MS\!}}}$, by a
finite renormalization \cite{AltCurMarPet81,SchSakKor87}%
\footnote{This simple ``rule of substitutions"" can be understood
by noticing that ${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}$ governs the scale
dependence of a physical observable, the Isgur-Wise form factor,
and, therefore, it is renormalization scheme invariant.}
\be
\label{MStoDR}
\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle MS\!}}}
=
\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}}
\lr{
1
-
\frac{N_c}{12} \frac{\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}}}{\pi}

\left(
(\alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}})^2
\right)}
\, .
\ee
Eqs.~\re{two-loop} and \re{two-loop-DR} define the cusp anomalous
dimensions in two different renormalization schemes, based on
dimensional regularization and dimensional reduction, respectively.
It is the latter scheme that does not break supersymmetry.

Using \re{gamma-as} and \re{two-loop-DR} we obtain the asymptotic behavior
of the twist-two anomalous dimension in the $\widebar{\rm DR}$ scheme
($\alpha_s \equiv \alpha_s^{{\rm \widebar{\scriptscriptstyle DR\!}}}$) in
various supersymmetric theories:

$\bullet$ In the $\mathcal{N}=1$ YM theory, one has one Majorana
fermion in the adjoint representation, $n_f = N_c$, and no scalars
$n_s=0$
\be
{\mit\Gamma}^{\mathcal{N} = 1}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s)
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}
+
\lr{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}}^2
\lr{\frac{3}{2} - \frac{\pi^2}{12}}
+
\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)
\,.
\label{N1}
\ee

$\bullet$ In the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ YM theory, one has two Majorana
fermions in the adjoint representation, $n_f = 2 N_c$, and two
real scalar fields in the adjoint representation, $n_s = 2 N_c$
\be
{\mit\Gamma}^{\mathcal{N} = 2}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s)
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}
+
\lr{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}}^2 \lr{1-\frac{\,\pi^2}{12}}
+
\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)
\, .
\label{N2}
\ee

$\bullet$ In the $\mathcal{N}=4$ YM theory, one has four Majorana
fermions in the adjoint representation, $n_f = 4N_c$, and  six
real scalar fields in the adjoint representation, $n_s = 6N_c$
\be
{\mit\Gamma}^{\mathcal{N} = 4}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s)
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}
+
\lr{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}}^2\lr{-\frac{\,\pi^2}{12}}
+
\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)\,.
\label{N4}
\ee
Notice that the two-loop correction to ${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)$
is positive in all cases except the $\mathcal{N}=4$ theory. It becomes
smaller as one goes from QCD to the $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$
theory and, then, it becomes negative at $\mathcal{N}=4$. We recall that
${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)> 0$ for arbitrary $\alpha_s$, Eq.~\re{pos}.

Together with Eqs.~\re{gamma-as}--\re{off-diag}, the expressions \re{N1}--\re{N4}
establish the large-$J$ asymptotics of the anomalous dimensions of the twist-two
operators in supersymmetric theories. Namely, the matrix of anomalous dimension
is diagonal at large $J$ with the entries on the main diagonal equal to $2
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s) \ln J$. Eq.~\re{N1} agrees with the results of
explicit two-loop calculations in Ref.~\cite{FloKeh}. Eq.~\re{N4} is in
disagreement with the
results of Ref.~\cite{KotLip}.%
\footnote{Eq.~\re{N4} were in agreement with the results of
Ref.~\cite{KotLip} if one would assume that their result is given in the
$\widebar{\rm MS}$ scheme and transforms the coupling constant to the
$\widebar{\rm DR}$ scheme via (\ref{MStoDR}).} Eq.~\re{N2} is a prediction since
a two-loop calculation in that case has not been performed yet.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conformal operators and integrable spin chains}
\label{ConformalOp}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

So far we have discussed two-particle composite operators. Let us
now generalize our consideration to operators involving many
fields. Such operators are of great phenomenological interest as
their matrix elements define, e.g., baryon distribution amplitudes
\cite{LepBro80} and higher-twist corrections in various
high-energy processes \cite{Jaf97}. To start with, we define first
a framework which solves partially the expected complications in the
mixing problem in this case.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Two-particle conformal operators}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The local twist-two operators $\mathcal{O}_{J}$ can be obtained from the
expansion of a nonlocal light-cone operator, cf.\ Eq.\ (\ref{CollinearPDFs}),
\be
\tr \left\{ X_1 (0) \, {\mit\Phi}_n [0, \xi] \, X_2 (\xi n) \,
{\mit\Phi}_{-n} [\xi, 0] \right\} = \sum_{J = 0}^\infty \frac{(- i
\xi)^J}{J!} \mathcal{O}_{J} (0) \, .
\label{gen-fun}
\ee
Here $X_{i}(n \xi)\equiv X_{i}^a(n \xi) t^a$ denotes a general primary operator
in the gauge theory defined in the adjoint representation of the $SU (N_c)$
group, ``living'' on the light-cone $n_\mu^2 = 0$ and having definite quantum
numbers with respect to transformations of the conformal group (see
Eq.~\re{Moebius} below). The latter condition implies that $X_{i}^a$ can be
identified as the quasi-partonic operator~\cite{BukFroKurLip85}, that is a scalar
field, or a specific component of the quark field and the gluon strength tensor.

Two Wilson lines in \re{gen-fun} run along the light-cone in opposite directions
between the points $0$ and $\xi$ and ensure the gauge invariance of the operator.
The local twist-two operators ${\cal O}_J$ were introduced in the previous
section. Let us reinstate their definition again,
\be
{\cal O}_J(\xi) = \tr\left\{ X_1 (n\xi) \left( i \, n \!\cdot\!
{\cal D} \right)^{J} X_2 (n\xi)\right\} = \tr\left\{ X_1 (\xi)
\left( i \partial \right)^{J} X_2 (\xi)\right\}
\, ,
\label{O-naive}
\ee
where in distinction with the previous case, Eq.~\re{O}, the covariant derivative
is defined in the adjoint representation, $\mathcal{D}_\mu
X=\partial_\mu-ig[A_\mu,X]$. Here in the second relation we have chosen the gauge
$n \cdot A (x) = 0$ and simplified the notation for the argument of the fields.
The twist-two operators defined in this way are not renormalized multiplicatively
and mix with operators containing total derivatives $(i\partial)^l{\cal
O}_{J-l}(\xi)$ with $1
\le l
\le J$. Although the mixing can be neglected for forward matrix elements like
\re{CollinearPDFs}, it survives in case one considers matrix elements with
different momenta in the initial and final state, or when they are a part of
multi-parton operators. In conformal theories, one can construct linear
combinations of such operators, the so-called conformal operators
\cite{BroLep79,EfrRad78,Mak80,Ohr82,BelMul98,Gor89}, in such a way that they
are renormalized autonomously to all orders in the coupling constant.%
\footnote{In gauge theories with broken conformal symmetry, like QCD, this
holds only to the lowest order in $\alpha_s$. Beyond the leading order
$\widehat O_J$'s start to mix with $(i \partial)^{l}\widehat O_{J - l}$. The
corresponding mixing anomalous dimensions are determined solely by the
conformal anomalies, see the last paper of Ref.\ \cite{BelMul98}, Eqs.\ (51)
and (113) for explicit expressions.} The mixing between these operators is
protected by the $SO(4,2)$ conformal symmetry of the gauge theory, more
precisely, by its collinear $SL(2,\mathbb{R}) \sim SU (1,1)$ subgroup, which
acts on the primary fields ``living'' on the light-cone as follows
\be
\xi \to \frac{a \xi + b}{c \xi + d}
\, , \qqquad
X_i(\xi) \to (c \xi + d)^{-2 j_i} X_i \lr{\frac{a \xi + b}{c \xi + d}}
\, ,
\label{Moebius}
\ee
with $a,\ldots,d$ real such that $ad - bc=1$. Here $j_i=(s_i+l_i)/2$ is the
conformal spin of the field $X_i(\xi)$ equal to one half of the sum of its
canonical dimension, $l$, and projection of the spin onto the light-cone,
$\Sigma_{-+} X_i(\xi) = s_i X_i(\xi)$. By definition, the conformal operators
$\widehat{\cal O}_J(\xi)$ are composite operators built from the primary fields
and satisfying \re{Moebius} with $j_i$ replaced by $J+j_1+j_2$. It is easy to see
that the operators \re{O-naive} do not obey the latter condition.

To simplify the analysis, one chooses the axial gauge $n \cdot A(x) = 0$.
Then, the operators in the left-hand side of \re{gen-fun} are given by the
product of two primary fields. It is transformed under \re{Moebius} in
accordance with the direct product of two $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ representations%
\footnote{These are unitary representations of the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group of
the discrete series.} labelled by the spins $j_1$ and $j_2$. Decomposing this
product into the sum of irreducible components, $[j_1]\otimes[j_2]=\sum_{J\ge 0}
[J+j_1+j_2]$, one can identify the spin-$J$ component as defining the conformal
operator $\widehat{\cal O}_J(\xi)$. It has the following form
\be
\widehat{\cal O}_J(\xi) = i^J \lr{\partial_2 + \partial_1}^J
P_J^{(\nu_1,\nu_2)} \lr{\frac{\partial_2 - \partial_1}{\partial_2
+ \partial_1}} \tr\left\{ X_1 (\xi_1)
X_2(\xi_2)\right\}\bigg|_{\xi_1 = \xi_2 = \xi} \,,
\label{Conf-op}
\ee
where $\partial_a = \partial/\partial \xi_a$, $\nu_a = 2 j_a - 1$ and
$P_J^{(\nu_1,\nu_2)}$ are the Jacobi polynomials. To restore gauge invariance,
one has to substitute $\partial X(\xi) = (n\cdot\mathcal{D})X(\xi)$. Going
back to \re{gen-fun}, one obtains the operator product expansion for a
nonlocal light-cone operator over the conformal operators, see, e.g., Refs.\
\cite{FerGatGri73,BalBra89,Mul98},
\be
\tr \left\{ X_1 (0) \, {\mit\Phi}_n [0, \xi] \, X_2 (\xi n) \,
{\mit\Phi}_{-n} [\xi, 0] \right\} = \sum_{J = 0}^\infty C_J
(\nu_1, \nu_2) \, \frac{(- i \xi)^J}{J!} \int_0^1 du\, u^{J +
\nu_1} (1 - u)^{J + \nu_2} \widehat{\cal O}_J (u\xi) \,,
\label{OPE-conf}
\ee
where
\begin{equation}
C_J (\nu_1, \nu_2)
=
(2 J  + \nu_1 + \nu_2 + 1)
\frac{
{\mit\Gamma} (J + 1) {\mit\Gamma} (J + \nu_1 + \nu_2 + 1)
}{
{\mit\Gamma} (J + \nu_1 + 1) {\mit\Gamma} (J + \nu_2 + 1)
}
\, .
\end{equation}
The Lorentz operators ${\cal O}_J$ can be re-expressed in terms of the conformal
operators $\widehat {\cal O}_J$ via
\begin{equation}
{\cal O}_J = \sum_{j = 0}^J c^J_j (\nu_1, \nu_2)
i^{J - j} \left( \partial_2 + \partial_1 \right)^{J - j} \widehat {\cal O}_j
\, ,
\end{equation}
with the expansion coefficients
$
c^J_j (\nu_1, \nu_2) = C_j (\nu_1, \nu_2)
\int_{0}^{1} d u \, (1 - u)^{\nu_1} u^{\nu_2 + J} P^{(\nu_1, \nu_2)}_j (2 u - 1)
\, ,
$
which can be calculated in terms of the hypergeometric function ${_3F_2}$. As
was already mentioned, the conformal operators evolve autonomously under
renormalization and their anomalous dimensions have a universal scaling
behavior at large $J$, Eqs.~\re{gamma-as} and \re{GKP}.

Let us consider the forward matrix element of the both sides of \re{OPE-conf} for
large light-cone separations, $\xi\gg 1$. In this limit, typical wavelength of
gluons exchanged between two fields $X_1(0)$ and $X_2(\xi n)$ scales as $\xi$ and
the eikonal approximation \re{Phi-app} is justified. This allows us to replace
the quantum operators $X_i(\xi)$ in the left-hand side of \re{OPE-conf} by Wilson
lines in the adjoint representations of the $SU(N_c)$. Then, the left-hand side
of \re{OPE-conf} can be approximated as $\vev{p\,|\widetilde W_\Pi(\xi)|p} \e^{-
i\xi (p \cdot n)}$, where the Wilson line in the adjoint representation,
$\widetilde W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} (\xi)$, evaluated along the same
${\scriptstyle\Pi}$-like contour as in \re{W-DIS}. In the right-hand side of
\re{OPE-conf}, one can neglect the contribution of operators with total
derivatives since their forward matrix elements vanish. In addition, at large
$\xi$ the sum is dominated by the contribution of operators with large spin $J$.
In this way, $\vev{p|\widehat{\cal O}_J(u\xi)|p}
\sim \vev{p|{\cal O}_J(0)|p} \sim (p\!\cdot\!n)^J \mu^{-2 {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}
(\alpha_s)\ln J}$ and
\be
\vev{p\,|\widetilde W_\Pi(\xi)|p} \e^{- i \xi (p \cdot n)}
\sim
\sum_{J} \frac{(-i\xi)^J}{J!} (p\!\cdot\!n)^J
J^{- 2 {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s) \ln [(p \cdot n) \mu]}
\, .
\ee
For $\xi\gg 1$ the sum in the right-hand side of this relation receives the
dominant contribution from $J \sim - i \xi (p\!\cdot\!n)$ leading
to~\cite{KorMar93}
\be
\vev{p\,|\widetilde W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} (\xi)|p}
\sim
\vev{p|\widehat{\cal O}_{J}(0)|p} \bigg|_{J = - i \xi (p \cdot n)}
\sim \mu^{-2 {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s) \ln [- i \xi (p \cdot n)]}
\, .
\label{W=O}
\ee
This relation establishes a correspondence between the Wilson line
in the adjoint representation and the matrix element of the
conformal operator analytically continued to large complex values
of the spin $J$. Notice that in the multi-color limit,
$N_c\to\infty$, one has $\vev{\widetilde W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} (\xi)
} = \vev{W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} (\xi)}^2$ with
$W_{\scriptstyle\Pi}(\xi)$ defined in the fundamental
representation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Multi-particle conformal operators}
\label{Section-Multiparticle}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us generalize the above analysis to conformal operators built from three and
more primary fields. As before, we construct a nonlocal operator containing $N$
primary (quasi-partonic) fields on the light-cone and expand it in powers of
light-cone separations
\be
\tr
\bigg\{
X_1(0) {\mit\Phi}_n [0,\xi_2] X_2(\xi_2) \ldots X_N (\xi_N) {\mit\Phi}_{- n} [\xi_N,0]
\bigg\}
=
\sum_{j_2 \cdots j_N \ge 0}
\frac{(-i \xi_2)^{j_2}}{j_2!} \ldots \frac{(-i\xi_N)^{j_N}}{j_N!}
\mathcal{O}_{j_2\cdots j_N}(0)
\, .
\label{XX}
\ee
Here the Wilson lines run between two adjacent fields along the light-cone
to ensure the gauge invariance. The local composite operators have the form
\be
\mathcal{O}_{j_2\cdots j_N} (\xi)
=
\tr\bigg\{
X_1 (\xi) \left(i n\!\cdot\! {\cal D} \right)^{j_2}
X_2 (\xi) \ldots \left(i n\!\cdot\! {\cal D} \right)^{j_N}
X_N (\xi)
\bigg\}
\, ,
\label{O-N}
\ee
where, as before, the covariant derivative is defined in the adjoint
representation. The evolution of these operators under renormalization group
transformations is much more complicated as compared with the previous case due
to larger number of particles involved and complicated color flow. The latter can
be simplified by going over to the multi-color limit $N_c \to \infty$. In this
limit, in the axial gauge $n\!\cdot\!A (x) = 0$, the planar Feynman diagrams
contributing to
the left-hand side of \re{XX} have the topology of a cylinder%
\footnote{For $N = 3$ the result is exact for arbitrary $N_c$.} as shown in
Fig.\ \ref{CylinderTopology}.

\end{figure}

In the multi-color limit, the operators \re{O-N} mix under renormalization among
themselves and with operators containing total derivatives. The mixing occurs
between the operators with the same total conformal spin $J+\sum_{k=1}^N j_{X_k}$
with $J=j_2+\ldots+ j_N$ and their number grows rapidly with $N$, even for the
forward matrix elements. In the latter case, the dimension of the mixing matrix
scales as $\sim J^{N-2}$ for large $J$. At $N=2$ this matrix has a single element
for arbitrary $J$. For the number of particles $N\ge 3$ the problem of
constructing multiplicatively renormalizable operators $\widehat O_J$ is reduced
to diagonalization of the mixing matrix whose size growes with $J$. As we will
argue below, the same problem is equivalent to solving a Schr\""odinger equation
for a Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg spin chain model. Before doing this, let us
analyze the picture from the point of view of the Wilson line formalism.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Wilson line approach}
\label{WilsonApp}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Following the Wilson line approach \cite{KorMar93}, one can obtain the scaling
behavior of the anomalous dimensions of conformal operators at large spin $J$.
To this end, we examine Eq.\ \re{XX} for large light-cone separations $\xi_2\sim
\xi_3 \sim \ldots \sim \xi_N \gg 1$. As in the previous case, the nonlocal
light-cone operator in the left-hand side of \re{XX} is dominated by the
contribution of soft gluons with the wavelength $\sim \xi_k$. This allows one
to apply the eikonal approximation and replace the quantum fields by eikonal
phases, the Wilson lines in the adjoint representation evaluated along rays that
run along momenta of particles and terminate at the light-cone. Assuming for
simplicity that all particles have the same momentum $p_\mu$ we apply the eikonal
approximation%
\footnote{Here we used the relation between the eikonal phases defined in the
fundamental (${\mit\Phi}$) and adjoint ($\widetilde{\mit\Phi}$) representations,
$t^b[\widetilde {\mit\Phi}]_{ab} = {\mit\Phi}^\dagger t^a {\mit\Phi}$.}
\be
X_i (\xi)
\to
\e^{-i \xi (p \cdot n)} {\mit\Phi}_p^\dagger [-\infty,\xi]
\, b_i(p) \,
{\mit\Phi}_p [-\infty,\xi]
\, ,
\ee
where $b_i (p) = b_i^a (p) \, t^a$ is the annihilation operator of the $i$-th
particle and ${\mit\Phi}^\dagger_p [-\infty,\xi] = {\mit\Phi}_{- p} [\xi,
\infty]$. Then, the matrix element of the operator entering the left-hand side of
\re{XX} between the vacuum and the $N$-particle state $\tr\left\{b_1^\dagger (p)
b_2^\dagger (p) \ldots b_N^\dagger (p) \right\} \ket{0}$ is given in the
multi-color limit by (see Fig.\ \ref{CylinderTopology})
\be
\vev{\tr W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} [\xi_1,\xi_2]}
\vev{\tr W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} [\xi_2,\xi_3]}
\ldots
\vev{\tr W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} [\xi_N,\xi_1]}
\e^{- i (p \cdot n)(\xi_2 + \ldots + \xi_N)}
\, ,
\label{prod-W}
\ee
with $\xi_1 = 0$ and $|\xi_{k + 1} - \xi_k| \sim \xi \gg 1$. (In arriving at this
relation we applied the ``vacuum dominance'' property, $\vev{\tr W_1 \tr
W_2}=\vev{\tr W_1}\vev{\tr W_2}+O(1/N_c^2)$.) Here $W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} [\xi_2,
\xi_3]$ is the Wilson line in the fundamental representation evaluated along the
${\scriptstyle\Pi}$-like contour that runs along the momentum $p_\mu$ from $-
\infty$ to the point $\xi_2 n_\mu$, then along the light-cone to $\xi_3 n_\mu$
and returns to infinity along $-p_\mu$. Due to the presence of two cusps on the
integration contour, $\vev{\tr W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} [\xi_1, \xi_2]}$ acquires the
cusp anomalous dimension $\sim
\mu^{- {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s) \ln [- i \xi (p \cdot n)]}$. In this
way, one finds from \re{prod-W} that the left-hand side of \re{XX} scales as
\be
\sim
\mu^{- N {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)
\ln [- i \xi (p \cdot n)]} \e^{- i (p \cdot n) (\xi_2 + \ldots + \xi_N)}
\, .
\ee
Let us now examine the scaling behavior of the right-hand side of \re{XX}. As
before, for large light-cone separations, $\xi\gg 1$, the sum is dominated by
the contribution of terms with $j_2 \sim \ldots \sim j_N \sim (-i \xi)$, or
equivalently $J = \sum_k j_k \sim - i \xi N$. The corresponding composite operator
$\mathcal{O}_{j_2\cdots j_N}(0)$ is renormalized multiplicatively and has the
anomalous dimension
\be
\gamma_J^{\rm (max)} = N {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s) \ln J
\, .
\label{gamma-max}
\ee
We recall that this result was obtained in the multi-color limit
$N_c \to \infty$ for $J\gg 1$.

Anomalous dimensions of the $N-$particle conformal operators are defined as
eigenvalues of the mixing matrix. As we argue in the next section, they can be
parameterized by the set of $N-2$ nonnegative integers
$\ell=(\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_{N-2})$ such that $0\le \ell_1\le \ldots \le
\ell_{N-2} \le J$. Their total number equals the
size of the matrix and grows at large $J$ as $J^{N-2}$. For given
spin $J$, the possible values of the anomalous dimensions occupy
the band
\be
\gamma_J^{\rm (min)}
\le
\gamma_J \lr{\ell_1,\cdots \ell_{N-2}}
\le
\gamma_J^{\rm (max)} \, .
\label{bounds}
\ee
Eq.~\re{gamma-max} sets up the upper bound in the spectrum of the
anomalous dimensions.

We recall that \re{gamma-max} was obtained from the analysis of
the nonlocal operator in the left-hand side of \re{XX} at large
light-cone separations between the fields. To establish the lower
bound in \re{bounds}, one has to relax the latter condition by
allowing two or more fields to be closely located on the
light-cone. It is convenient to choose the axial gauge
$n\!\cdot\!A (x) = 0$ and consider
$\tr\left\{X_1(0)X_2(\xi_2)\ldots X_N(\xi_N)\right\}$ in the
region $\xi_2\ll 1$ and $|\xi_{k+1}-\xi_k|\sim \xi\gg 1$ with
$k\ge 2$. The fields $X_1(0)$ and $X_2(\xi_2)$ are separated along
the light-cone by a (relatively) short distance. They interact
with each other by exchanging particles with short wavelengths,
thus invalidating the eikonal approximation. At the same time, the
interaction of these two fields with the remaining fields still
occurs through soft gluon exchanges. Since the soft gluons with
the wavelength $\sim \xi$ can not resolve the fields $X_1(0)$ and
$X_2(\xi_2)$, they couple to their total color charge. This means
that one can replace the bilocal operator $X_1(0)X_2(\xi_2)$ by
its expansion over the two-particle conformal operators
$\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_j(0)$ and apply the eikonal approximation
to $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_j(\xi_2)$ and remaining fields
$X_3(\xi_3),\ldots,X_N(\xi_N)$ afterwards. Repeating the analysis
one arrives at the same expression as \re{prod-W} with the only
difference that the factor $\vev{\tr W_{\scriptstyle\Pi} [\xi_1,
\xi_2]}$ is missing. As a consequence, the anomalous dimension of
the nonlocal light-cone operator is given at large $J$ by
\re{gamma-max} with $N$ replaced by $N-2$. In other words, the
coefficient in front of ${\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp} (\alpha_s)\ln J$
in Eq.~\re{gamma-max} counts the number of fields separated along
the light-cone by large distances $\xi \sim i J$.

This suggests that the minimal anomalous dimension in \re{bounds}
corresponds to the configuration when all fields in the left-hand
side of \re{XX} are grouped into two clusters on the light-cone
located at the points $0$ and $\xi \sim i J$, respectively,
leading to
\be
\gamma_J^{\rm (min)} = 2 {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s) \ln J
\, ,
\label{gamma-min}
\ee
in agreement with the results of
Refs.~\cite{BraDerMan98,BraDerKorMan99,Bel99a,Bel99b,DerKorMan00,BKM}. In this
case, the right-hand side of \re{XX} receives contribution from the whole tower
of spin-$J$ conformal operators with the anomalous dimensions satisfying
\re{bounds}. Going over to the limit $\mu\to\infty$, one finds that the
right-hand side of \re{XX} receives dominant contribution from the operators with
minimal anomalous dimension given by \re{gamma-min}.

As a function of large spin $J$, the anomalous dimensions $\gamma_J
\lr{\ell_1,\cdots \ell_{N-2}}$ form the family of (non-intersecting)
trajectories labelled by the integers $\ell_1,\cdots\ell_{N-2}$. Since the width
of the band \re{bounds} scales as $\ln J$, while the total number of anomalous
dimensions $\gamma_J\lr{\ell_1,\cdots \ell_{N-2}}$ grows as a power of $J$, one
obtains that for $J\gg 1$ the distribution of the trajectories inside the band
can be described by a continuous function whose explicit form depends on the
coupling constant.  Going over from the weak to the strong coupling one finds
that the trajectories do not intercept as $\alpha_s$ increases although their
distribution inside the band \re{bounds} is modified.

\subsubsection{Hamiltonian approach to evolution equations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The above analysis relies on the properties of Wilson loops. Let us now develop a
``dual'' picture based on the properties of conformal operators. In the
multi-color limit, the conformal operators are given by linear combinations of
composite operators \re{O-N} including the operators with total derivatives. As
was already discussed above, to construct $N$-particle conformal operators, one
has to decompose the tensor product of $N$ representations of the
$SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group labelled by conformal spins, $j_k\equiv j_{X_k}$, of the
fields $X_i(\xi)$ and project out the nonlocal operator \re{XX} onto the spin-$J$
representation
\be
[j_1] \otimes [j_2] \otimes \ldots \otimes [j_n]
=
\sum_{J\ge 0} [J + j_1 + j_2 + \ldots + j_N]
\, .
\ee
Subsequently applying the rule for the sum of two $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ spins,
$[j_1] \otimes [j_2] = \sum_{j_{12}\ge 0} [j_1 + j_2 + j_{12}]$, one finds
that the spin-$J$ representation has a nontrivial multiplicity $n_J =
(J+N-2)!/[J!(N-2)!]$. It is uniquely specified by the ``external'' conformal
spins $j_1,\ldots,j_N$ and ``internal'' spins $0\le j_{12} \le j_{123} \le
\ldots \le j_{12\ldots N-1}\le J$ with $j_{12\ldots k}$ defining the total
spin in the $(12\ldots k)$-channel. Each irreducible spin-$J$ component gives
rise to the following local composite operator
\be
\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_J^{\{j\}} (\xi)
=
P_J^{\{j\}} (i\partial_1,\ldots,i\partial_N)
\tr\left\{
X_1 (\xi_1) X_2 (\xi_2) \ldots X_N (\xi_N)
\right\}\bigg|_{\xi_1 = \ldots = \xi_N = \xi}
\, ,
\label{O-basis}
\ee
where $\{j\}\equiv (j_{12}, \ldots, j_{12\cdots N - 1})$ and $P_J^{\{j\}}
(x_1,\ldots,x_N)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $N$ in momentum
fractions $x_k$. This polynomial is the highest weight vector of the
spin-$J$ $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ representation of the discrete series. It
satisfies the system of differential equations
\ba
&&\lr{\vec L_{1}+\ldots+\vec L_{k}}^2 P_J^{\{j\}}
=
J_{12\cdots k} (J_{12\cdots k} - 1)P_J^{\{j\}}
\, , \qquad
(k = 2,\ldots,N)
\, ,
\nonumber
\\
&&\lr{L_{1}^++\ldots+L_{N}^+} P_J^{\{j\}} = 0\,,
\label{P-system}
\ea with
$J_{12\cdots k}=j_1+\ldots+j_k+ j_{12\cdots k}$ and $j_{12\cdots
N}\equiv J$. Here $\vec L_k=(L_k^+,L_k^-,L_k^0)$ are the
$SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators in the ``momentum'' representation
\be
L_k^- = - x_k
\, , \qquad
L_k^+ = 2 j_k \partial_{x_k} + x_k \partial_{x_k}^2
\, , \qquad
L_k^0 = j_k + x_k \partial_{x_k}
\, ,
\label{L's}
\ee
with $\vec L^2=(L^+L^-+L^-L^+)/2+L_0^2$. At $N = 2$ the solution to \re{P-system}
is given by Jacobi polynomials (see Eq.~\re{Conf-op}). For higher $N$, it can
be constructed iteratively as a product of the $N = 2$ solutions
\cite{BraDerKorMan99,Bel99a}.%
\footnote{One can obtain the same expression by subsequently applying the
fusion rules \re{OPE-conf} to the product of $N$ primary fields.}

The operators \re{O-basis} are transformed under the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ conformal
transformations as primary fields with the same conformal spin $J + \sum_k j_k$.
However, they do not have autonomous evolution and mix under renormalization with
each other. To construct multiplicative conformal operators, one has to
diagonalize the corresponding $n_J\times n_J$ mixing matrix. Its eigenstates
define the coefficients $c_{\ell,\{j\}}$ of the expansion of the conformal
operators over the basis \re{O-basis} and the corresponding eigenvalues provide
their anomalous dimensions
\be
\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_{J,\ell}(\xi)
=
\sum_{\{j\}} c_{\ell,\{j\}}\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_J^{\{j\}}(\xi)
\equiv
P_{J,\ell}(i\partial_1,\ldots,i\partial_N)
\tr\left\{
X_1 (\xi_1) X_2(\xi_2) \ldots X_N(\xi_N)
\right\} \bigg|_{\xi_1 = \ldots = \xi_N = \xi}
\, ,
\label{general-O}
\ee
where the subscript $\ell=(\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_{N-2})$ with $0\le \ell_1\le
\ldots\ell_{N-2}\le J$ enumerates different conformal operators, or equivalently homogenous
polynomials $P_{J,\ell} (x_1,
\ldots, x_N)=\sum_{\{j\}} c_{\ell,\{j\}} P_J^{\{j\}} (x_1,\ldots,x_N)$.

Thus, in distinction with the $N=2$ case, the conformal symmetry alone does not
allow one to construct multiplicatively renormalizable conformal operators for
$N \ge 3$. Nevertheless, it reduces the problem to diagonalizing the mixing
matrix of dimension $n_J$. This matrix has a number of remarkable properties.
To begin with, we notice that the homogenous polynomials entering \re{O-basis}
are orthogonal to each other with respect to the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ scalar product
\be
\vev{J,\{j\}|J',\{j'\}}
\equiv
\int_0^1 [d^N x]\, x_1^{2j_1-1} \ldots x_N^{2j_N-1}
P_J^{\{j\}} (x_1,\ldots,x_N) P_{J'}^{\{j'\}} (x_1,\ldots,x_N)
\sim
\delta_{JJ'}\delta_{jj'}
\, ,
\label{scal-prod}
\ee
where $[d^Nx] = dx_1 \ldots dx_N \delta (1 - \sum_kx_k)$ and integration goes
over $0\le x_k\le 1$. This follows from the fact that the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$
generators \re{L's} are self-adjoint operators on the vector space endowed with
the scalar product \re{scal-prod}. Then, the mixing matrix can be interpreted as
a Hamiltonian acting on the Hilbert space \re{scal-prod}, $\vev{J,\{j\}|
\mathcal{H}_N|J',\{j'\}}$. Denoting $\ket{J,\ell}\equiv P_{J,\ell}(x_1,\ldots,x_N)$,
one can determine the anomalous dimensions of the conformal operators
$\gamma_J(\ell)$ as solutions to the $N$-particle Schr\""odinger equation
\be
\mathcal{H}_N\ket{J,\ell} = \gamma_J{(\ell)}\ket{J,\ell}
\label{Sch}
\ee
under additional (highest weight) condition for its eigenstates
\be
L_{\rm tot}^+ \ket{J,\ell} = 0
\, , \qquad
L_{\rm tot}^0 \ket{J,\ell} = (J + \sum_{k = 1}^N j_k) \ket{J,\ell}
\, ,
\ee
with $\vec L_{\rm tot}\equiv \sum_{k=1}^N \vec L_k$ being the total conformal
spin. The Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_N$ commutes with the total $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$
spin, $[\vec L_{\rm tot},\mathcal{H}_N]=0$ and
is a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space \re{scal-prod}. This ensures that
the anomalous dimensions $\gamma_J{(\ell)}$ take real values.

In perturbation theory, the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_N$ can be obtained from
explicit calculation of Feynman diagrams in the multi-color limit $N_c \to
\infty$~\cite{BukFroKurLip85}. To the lowest order in $\alpha_s$, due to cylinder-like topology of the
planar diagrams, the interaction occurs only between nearest neighbors (see Fig.\
\ref{CylinderTopology})
\be
\mathcal{H}_N
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}
\Big(
H_{12} + H_{23} + \ldots + H_{N1}
\Big)
+
{\cal O} \left( (\alpha_s N_c)^2 \right)
\, ,
\label{H_N}
\ee
where the two-particle Hamiltonian $H_{k,k+1}$ acts on the ``coordinates''
$x_k$ and $x_{k+1}$ only.%
\footnote{We recall that $x_k$ has the meaning of the momentum fraction
carried by the particle described by the field $X_k(\xi_k)$.} Conformal
invariance implies that $H_{k,k+1}$ depends on the sum of two $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$
spins
\ba
(\vec L_k + \vec L_{k+1})^2
\!\!\!&\equiv&\!\!\!
J_{k,k+1} (J_{k,k+1} - 1)

\\

2(j_2 x_1 - j_1 x_2) (\partial_1 - \partial_2) + (j_1 + j_2)(j_1 + j_2 - 1)
\, ,
\label{Jk}
\ea
where $\partial_k = \partial/\partial x_k$. The general expression for
$H_{k,k+1}$ looks like
\be
H_{k,k+1} = \psi(J_{k,k+1}) + \ldots
\, ,
\label{H-2-particle}
\ee
where $\psi(x) = d\ln\mit{\Gamma}(x)/dx$ is the Euler psi-function. Here ellipses
denote additional, rational in $J_{k,k+1}$ terms which are subleading for
$J_{k,k+1}\gg 1$. In distinction with the first term in the right-hand side of
\re{H-2-particle}, they depend on the type of particles involved.

The two-particle Hamiltonian \re{H-2-particle} has a universal form for large
spins $J_{k,k+1} \gg 1$
\be
H_{k,k+1}=\ln J_{k,k+1} + \mathcal{O}\left((J_{k,k+1})^0\right)\,.
\label{H-2-log}
\ee
At $N = 2$ the Hamiltonian \re{H_N} equals $\mathcal{H}_{N=2} = 2 ({\alpha_s
N_c}/{\pi})H_{12}$ and its eigenvalues, $\gamma_{N = 2}(J) \sim 2 ({\alpha_s
N_c}/{\pi})\ln J$ for $J\gg 1$, define the anomalous dimension of the
two-particle conformal operator at weak coupling, Eq.~\re{gamma-as}. To find
the spectrum of anomalous dimension for $N \ge 3$, one has to solve the
Schr\""odinger equation \re{Sch} for the $N$-particle Hamiltonian \re{H_N}.
It turns out the quantum-mechanical system with the Hamiltonian \re{Sch}
possesses a hidden symmetry and is intrinsically related to Heisenberg
spin magnets.

We would like to emphasize that the equivalence between evolution equations and
dynamical Hamiltonian systems is a rather general phenomenon in Yang-Mills
theories. In particular, similar integrable structures appear in the Regge
asymptotics \cite{regge} with the evolution ``time"" being the logarithm of the
energy scale $t_{\rm Regge} =
\ln s$ and in the low-energy behavior of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ effective action
with the ``time"" $t_{\rm SYM}= \ln \Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ \cite{n=2}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Heisenberg spin chains}
\label{HeisenbergChain}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us substitute \re{H-2-particle} into \re{H_N} and define the following
Hamiltonian
\be
\mathcal{H}_N^{\rm quan}=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}\sum_{k=1}^N \psi(J_{k,k+1})\,,
\label{H-eff}
\ee
with $J_{N,N+1}\equiv J_{N,1}$. Notice that, in general, it differs from the
exact QCD Hamiltonian \re{H_N} by terms that vanish for $J_{k,k+1}\gg 1$.
Therefore one should expect that in spite of the fact that the fine structure of
the energy spectrum of two Hamiltonians may be different, their asymptotic
behavior for $J\gg 1$ is the same. Exact calculations at $N=3$ confirm such
expectations \cite{BraDerMan98,BraDerKorMan99,Bel99a,Bel99b,DerKorMan00,BKM}. The
main advantage of dealing with \re{H-eff} is that the Hamiltonian \re{H-eff}
possesses a set of integrals of motion, $q = (q_2, \ldots, q_N)$,
\be
[\mathcal{H}_N^{\rm quan}, q_n] = [q_n, q_m] = 0 \, ,
\ee
and, as a consequence, the Schr\""odinger equation for $\mathcal{H}_N^{\rm quan}$
turns out to be completely integrable
\cite{BraDerMan98,BraDerKorMan99,Bel99a,Bel99b,DerKorMan00,BKM}. The Hamiltonian
\re{H-eff} is well-known in the theory of integrable models. It has been
constructed in \cite{SklTakFad79,Fad80,FadTak79,KulResSkl81} as a generalization
of the celebrated spin-$1/2$ XXX Heisenberg magnet to higher spin representations
of the $SU(2)$ and $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ groups.

Eq.~\re{H-eff} defines periodic Heisenberg spin chain model of length $N$ and
spins being the $SL (2,\mathbb{R})$ generators. The value of the spin at the
$k$-th site is given by the conformal spin of the corresponding primary field.
Such identification allows one to solve the spectral problem for the Hamiltonian
\re{H-eff} exactly by the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method
\cite{SklTakFad79,Fad80,FadTak79,KulResSkl81,TarTakFad83,Fad95}. In particular,
using the Lax operator for the XXX Heisenberg spin magnet
\be
\mathbb{L}_k(u)
=
\lr{
\begin{array}{cc}
u + i {L}^0_k & i {L}^+_k \\
i {L}^-_k     & u - i {L}^0_k
\end{array}
}
\label{Lax}
\ee
with $L_k^0$ and $L_k^\pm$ being the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ generators \re{L's}, one
can obtain the explicit form of the integrals of motion $q_2,\ldots, q_N$ from
the expansion of the transfer matrix $t_N(u)$ in powers of the spectral parameter
$u$
\be
t_N(u)
=
\tr
\left[ \mathbb{L}_1(u) \mathbb{L}_2(u)\ldots \mathbb{L}_N(u) \right]
=
2 u^N + q_2 u^{N - 2} + \ldots + q_N
\, ,
\label{t-N}
\ee
with $q_2 = - \vec L_{\rm tot}^2 + \sum_{k = 1}^N j_k (j_k - 1)$ depending on the
total spin of the system $J$. Due to complete integrability of the model, the
energy spectrum is uniquely specified by their eigenvalues, $E_N = E_N (q_2,
\ldots, q_N)$. Applying the Bethe Ansatz
\cite{SklTakFad79,Fad80,FadTak79,KulResSkl81,TarTakFad83,Fad95}, one can
calculate explicitly both the energy spectrum and the corresponding
eigenfunctions. We recall that the former defines the anomalous dimensions of
conformal operators, while the latter determine the polynomials $P_{J,\ell} (x_1,
\ldots, x_N)$ entering \re{general-O}.

For our purposes, we are interested in finding the large $J$ asymptotic
behavior of the energy spectrum. Assuming for simplicity that the
particles have the same $SL (2,\mathbb{R})$ spin, $j_1 = \ldots = j_N
\equiv j$ one obtains the following asymptotic expression for the energy
\cite{Kor95b,BraDerKorMan99,Bel99b}
\be
\gamma_{J}(\ell)
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}
\left\{
\ln 2
+
\Re{\rm e}
\left[
\sum_{k = 1}^N \psi(j + i \lambda_k) + \gamma_{\rm E}
\right]
+
\mathcal{O}(1/J^{2N})
\right\}
\, ,
\label{gamma-int}
\ee
where $\lambda_k$ are roots of the transfer matrix \re{t-N}, $t_N(u) = 2
\prod_k (u-\lambda_k)$. According to \re{t-N}, the quantum numbers $q_k$ are
given by symmetric polynomials of degree $k$ in $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_N$.
For $J\gg 1$ one finds that the roots are real and they scale differently with
$J$ in the upper and lower part of the spectrum. In the upper part of the
spectrum, all roots scale as $\lambda_k \sim J$ with $k = 1, \ldots, N$ leading
to $q_k = \mathcal{O}(J^k)$
\be
\gamma_J^{\rm (max)}
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi} \ln \left| \lambda_1\lambda_2\ldots \lambda_N \right|
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi} \ln q_N = N \frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}\ln J \, .
\label{Gamma-up}
\ee
In the lower part of the spectrum, $\lambda_1 \sim -\lambda_2\sim \mathcal{O} (J)$
and $\lambda_k \sim J^0$ for $k\ge 3$ (notice that $\sum_k\lambda_k = 0$ due to
absence of the $u^{N-1}-$term in the right-hand side of \re{t-N}). This leads
to $q_k \sim J^2$ and
\be
\gamma_J^{\rm (min)}
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi} \ln \left| \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \right|
=
2 \frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi}\ln J
\, .
\label{Gamma-down}
\ee
We observe a perfect agreement of these expressions with Eqs.~\re{gamma-max} and
\re{gamma-min} obtained within the Wilson line approach.

In the Wilson line approach, the asymptotic behaviour of the anomalous
dimensions, Eqs.~\re{gamma-max} and \re{gamma-min} is tied to the scaling scaling
behaviour of the two-particle spins $J_{k,k+1}$ while in the Hamiltonian approach
Eqs.~\re{Gamma-up} and \re{Gamma-down} follow from similar behaviour of the roots
$\lambda_k$ of the transfer matrix \re{t-N}. Let us demonstrate that
$\lambda_k\sim J_{k,k+1}$ at large $J$.

By the definition, $J_{k,k+1}$ is the sum of two $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ spins. Its
eigenvalues satisfy $j_k+j_{k+1} \le J_{k,k+1} \le J$, where $J$ is the total
spin of $N$ particles. Since $[\mathcal{H}_N,J_{k,k+1}]\neq 0$, one can not
assign a definite value of $J_{k,k+1}$ to the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian
$\mathcal{H}_N$. Nevertheless, for $J\to\infty$ the system of $N$ particles
approaches a quasiclassical regime in which quantum fluctuations are frozen and
the spins $J_{k,k+1}$ can be treated as classical variables. To see this one
notices that for quantum-mechanical systems defined by the Hamiltonian \re{H-eff}
the ``effective'' Planck constant equals unity, $\hbar=1$, and the energy scale
is defined by the total spin $J$. This suggests that for $J \gg
\hbar$ one can solve the Schr\""odinger equation
\re{Sch} by the WKB methods~\cite{Kor95b}.

In the WKB approach, one looks for the solution to \re{Sch} in the form
\be
\ket{J,\ell}\equiv P_{J,\ell}(x_1,\ldots,x_N) = \exp\lr{\frac{i}{\hbar}
S_0(\vec x)+ i S_1(\vec x) + \mathcal{O}(\hbar)}\,,
\label{WKB}
\ee
where $\vec x=(x_1,\ldots,x_N)$. To find the functions $S_0(\vec x)$, $S_1(\vec
x)$, $\ldots$, one requires that the wave function \re{WKB} has to be an
eigenstate of the transfer matrix \re{t-N}, or equivalently diagonalize
simultaneously the integrals of motion $q_2,\ldots,q_N$. In this way, one obtains
that the leading term $S_0(\vec x)$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equations in
the underlying classical system, while subleading terms can be  expressed in
terms of $S_0(\vec x)$. To go over to the classical limit, one applies the
operator of the two-particle spin defined in \re{Jk} to the WKB wave function
\re{WKB}
\be
\hbar^2(\vec L_k + \vec L_{k+1})^2 \e^{iS_0/\hbar}
=
\left\{
x_k x_{k+1} (p_k-p_{k+1})^2 + \mathcal{O}(\hbar)
\right\}
\e^{iS_0/\hbar}
\, ,
\label{WKB-L2}
\ee
where we have restored in the left-hand side the dependence on the Planck
constant and $p_k = - i \hbar\partial_{x_k} S_0(\vec x)$ is a classical momentum
of the $k$-th particle. In a similar manner, the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ spin
operators \re{L's} can be replaced by classical functions on the phase space
of $N$ particles
\be
L_{k,\, \rm cl}^- = -x_k
\, , \qquad
L_{k,\, \rm cl}^+ = - x_k p_k^2
\, ,\qquad
L_{k,\, \rm cl}^0 = i x_k p_k
\, .
\label{L-class}
\ee
Notice that the dependence on a single-particle spin disappears since
$j_k=\mathcal{O}(\hbar)$. One verifies that, in agreement with \re{WKB-L2},
\be
(\vec L_{k,\, \rm cl} + \vec L_{k+1,\, \rm cl})^2
=
(J_{k,k+1}^{\,\rm cl})^2
=
x_k x_{k+1} (p_k - p_{k+1})^2
\, .
\label{J-class}
\ee
Here $J_{k,k+1}^{\,\rm cl}$ defines the classical limit of the two-particle spin
$J_{k,k+1}$. Then, replacing $J_{k,k+1}\to \hbar J_{k,k+1}^{\,\rm cl}$ in
\re{H-eff}, one expands the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_N^{\rm quan}$ in powers of
$\hbar$ and identifies the leading term of the expansion as the Hamiltonian of
the classical model
\be
\mathcal{H}_N^{\,\rm cl}
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}\sum_{k=1}^N
\ln \lr{J_{k,k+1}^{\,\rm cl}}^2
\, .
\label{H-class}
\ee
Remarkably enough, this Hamiltonian inherits integrability properties of
the quantum model. It contains a set of integrals of motion $q_k^{\rm cl}$
$(k = 2, \ldots, N)$
\be
\{ \mathcal{H}_N^{\,\rm cl}, q_k^{\,\rm cl} \}
=
\{ q_n^{\,\rm cl}, q_k^{\,\rm cl} \}
=
0
\, ,
\ee
with the Poisson bracket defined as
$\{f,g\}=\partial_{x_k}f\partial_{p_k}g-\partial_{p_k}f\partial_{x_k}g$.  To
obtain their explicit form, one replaces the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ spin operators
in \re{Lax} by their classical counterparts \re{L-class} and substitutes the
resulting expression for the Lax operator into \re{t-N}. This leads to
\be
q_n^{\,\rm cl}
=
\sum_{1\le j_1 < \cdots < j_n\le N} x_{j_1} \ldots x_{j_{n-1}}
x_{j_n} (p_{j_1}-p_{j_2})
\ldots (p_{j_{n-1}}-p_{j_n})(p_{j_n}-p_{j_1})\,,
\label{qn-class}
\ee
with $n=2,\ldots, N$. One observes that $\lr{q_N^{\,\rm cl}}^2 = \prod_{k=1}^N
\lr{J_{k,k+1}^{\,\rm cl}}^2$ and, therefore, the classical Hamiltonian \re{H-class}
can be written as
\be
\mathcal{H}_N^{\,\rm cl}
=
\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi} \ln q_N^{\,\rm cl}
\, .
\label{H-asym}
\ee
By construction, $\mathcal{H}_N^{\,\rm cl}$ defines a classical limit of the
Heisenberg $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ spin magnet model. Evaluating $\mathcal{H}_N^{\,\rm
cl}$ along the orbits of classical motion of $N$ particles, one obtains the
energy spectrum of the quantum magnet to the leading order of the WKB expansion,
or equivalently the large-$J$ behavior of the anomalous dimensions
$\gamma_J{(\ell)}$ of conformal operators, Eq.~\re{Sch}. According to
\re{H-asym}, this behavior is controlled by the large-$J$ scaling of the
``highest'' integral of motion $q_N^{\,\rm cl}$. In the WKB approach, the
spectrum of $q_N$ is obtained by imposing the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization
conditions on the periodic orbits of classical motion of $N$
particles~\cite{Kor95b}. As was shown in Ref.\
\cite{BraDerKorMan99,Bel99a,Bel99b,DerKorMan00}, the WKB spectrum of anomalous
dimensions derived in this manner is in agreement with the exact expressions
\re{Gamma-up} and \re{Gamma-down}.

Finally, let us establish the relation between the roots $\lambda_k$ of the
transfer matrix and the two-particle spins $J_{k,k+1}^{\rm \,cl}$. Substituting
$t_N(u)=2\prod_k(u-\lambda_k)$ into \re{t-N} one obtains that the roots
parameterize the eigenvalues of the integrals of motion $q_n$. At large $J$,
replacing $q_n$ by their classical counterparts defined in \re{qn-class}, one
finds that $q_n^{\,\rm cl}$ are given by symmetric polynomials in
$\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_N$ of degree $n$ (with $n = 2,
\ldots, N$). Therefore, the large-$J$ behavior of the momenta $p_k
- p_{k+1}$ and the roots $\lambda_k$ are in one-to-one correspondence with each
other. In particular, in the upper part of the spectrum, Eq.~\re{Gamma-up}, one
gets from $\lambda_k\sim J$ that $p_k-p_{k+1}\sim J$, or equivalently
$J_{k,k+1}^{\rm\,cl}\sim J$ for $k=1,\ldots,N$. In similar manner, in the lower
part of the spectrum, Eq.~\re{Gamma-down}, $\lambda_k\sim J^0$ leads to
$p_k-p_{k+1}\sim J^0$ and $J_{k,k+1}^{\rm\,cl}\sim J^0$. We recall that the
$x_k$-variables  entering \re{J-class} have the meaning of momentum fractions
carried by $N$ particles described by quantum fields $X_k(\xi_k)$. Then,
conjugated to them the $p_k$-variables are the light-cone coordinates of the same
fields, $p_k\equiv \xi_k$. Thus, in the upper and the lower part of the spectrum
one has $\xi_k-\xi_{k+1}\sim J$ and $\xi_k-\xi_{k+1}\sim J^0$, respectively.
These properties are in agreement with the results obtained in section
\ref{WilsonApp} within the Wilson line approach.

We notice that the anomalous dimensions of $N-$particle conformal operators,
Eq.~\re{Gamma-up} and \re{Gamma-down}, were obtained using the lowest-order
expression for the QCD evolution kernels whereas Eqs.\ \re{gamma-max} and
\re{gamma-min} hold to all orders in the coupling constant. The above analysis
suggests that at large $J$ the higher order corrections modify the classical
Hamiltonian \re{H-class} and \re{H-asym} in the following way
\be
\mathcal{H}_N^{\,\rm cl}
=
\frac{1}{2} {\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)
\sum_{k = 1}^N \ln \lr{J_{k,k+1}^{\,\rm cl}}^2
=
{\mit\Gamma}_{\rm cusp}(\alpha_s)\ln q_N^{\,\rm cl}
\, ,
\ee
with $J_{k,k+1}^{\,\rm cl}$ and $q_N^{\,\rm cl}$ given by the same expressions
as before, Eqs.~\re{J-class} and \re{qn-class}, respectively.

\section{Cusp anomaly at weak coupling}
\label{WeakCusp}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us revisit the computation of the cusp anomalous dimension to the lowest
order of perturbation theory aiming on an analogy with the stringy computation
of Wilson loops within the AdS/CFT framework. As we will see momentarily, the
cusp anomaly in the weak coupling regime can be interpreted as a {\sl quantum\/}
transition amplitude for a test particle propagating in the radial time $\ln r$
and the angular coordinate $\theta$. This should be compared with the strong
coupling calculation~\cite{DruGroOog99,Kru02,Mak02}, in which the same quantity
is given by a {\sl classical\/} action function for a particle propagating on
the same phase space.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cusp anomaly in perturbation theory}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To the lowest order in the coupling constant, the Wilson line expectation value
is given by
\be
W = \vev{P \exp\lr{i \oint_{\wedge} dx_\mu A^\mu(x)}}= 1 + \frac{(ig)^2}{2} t^a
t^a
\int_C dx_\mu\int_C dy_\nu \, D^{\mu\nu}(x - y) + \mathcal{O}(g^4)
\, ,
\label{W-1-loop}
\ee
where $D_{\mu\nu}(x - y) \delta^{ab} = \vev{0|T A^a_\mu(x)A^b_\nu(y)|0}$ is a
gluon propagator and $t^at^a=N_c$ is the Casimir operator in the adjoint
representation of the $SU(N_c)$. To calculate the cusp anomaly we choose the
integration contour $C$, see Fig.\ \ref{Cylinder} (left), to be the same as for
the Isgur-Wise form factor, Eq.~\re{W}. In this way, we obtain
\be
W (v\!\cdot\!v')
=
1 - \frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi} \Big( w (v\!\cdot\!v') - w(1) \Big)
+
\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)
\, ,
\label{one-loop}
\ee
where $v_\mu$ and $v'_\mu$ are tangents to the integration contour in the
vicinity of the cusp, $v^2 = v'{}^2 = 1$, $v\!\cdot\! v' = \cosh\theta$,
$w(1) = w(v\!\cdot\!v) = w(v'\!\cdot\!v')$ and
\be
w (v\!\cdot\!v')
=
\int^0_{-\infty} d s \int_0^\infty d t \frac{v \!\cdot\! v'}{( v s - v' t )^2}
\, ,
\label{w}
\ee
with $s$ and $t$ being proper times. Going over to higher orders in $\alpha_s$,
one takes into account that the Wilson loop possesses the property of non-abelian
exponentiation~\cite{Ste81}
\begin{equation}
\label{WilsonExponentiation}
\ln W = \sum_k \lr{ \frac{\alpha_s N_c}{\pi} }^k w_k \,,
\end{equation}
where the weights $w_k$ receive contribution from diagrams to the $k$-th order
in $\alpha_s$ with maximally nonabelian color structure. In our case, the
exponentiation property states that $w_1=w(v\cdot v')-w(1)$.

It is straightforward to perform the integration in \re{w}. For our purposes,
however, we change the integration variables to $r_> = \max(t, - s)$ and
$r_< = \min(t, - s)$ and apply the identity
\be
\frac{v \!\cdot\! v'}{( v s - v' t )^2}
=
- \frac1{r_>^2}
\left\{
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty
(-1)^n \lr{\frac{r_<}{r_>}}^n \frac{(n + 1)^2}{n(n + 2)} \, U_n (v\!\cdot\! v')
+
\frac{1}{4}
\right\}
\, ,
\label{Chebyshev}
\ee
where $U_n(\cosh\theta)=\sinh((n + 1)\theta)/\sinh \theta$ are Chebyshev
polynomials of the second kind \cite{BatErd53-2}. Its substitution into
\re{w} leads to
\be
\label{WinTermsOfChebyshev}
w(v \!\cdot\! v')
=
- 2
\left\{
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{n + 1}{n(n + 2)} \, U_n (\cosh \theta)
+
\frac{1}{4}
\right\}
\,
\int_{r_{\rm min}}^{r_{\rm max}}\frac{dr_>}{r_>}
=
\theta\coth\theta \, \ln(\mu r_{\rm max})
\, ,
\ee
where $r_{\rm min}\sim 1/\mu$ and $r_{\rm max}$ are ultraviolet and infrared
cut-offs, respectively. Combining together \re{one-loop} and
\re{WinTermsOfChebyshev}, one verifies that the Wilson line satisfies the
evolution equation \re{RG}.

Eqs.~\re{Chebyshev} and \re{WinTermsOfChebyshev} have a simple interpretation
within the radial quantization approach \cite{FubHanJac73,Gal84}. In this
formalism, one performs a quantization procedure using four-dimensional
(Euclidean) polar coordinates $r^2=x_\mu^2$ and $v_\mu = x_\mu/r$. This allows
one to separate the dynamics in the radial and angular coordinates by decomposing
the propagators of fields over partial waves defined as eigenstates of the
operator of the angular momentum
