\title{Galois currents and the projective kernel in Rational Conformal Field
Theory}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The notion of Galois currents in Rational Conformal Field Theory is
introduced and illustrated on simple examples. This leads to a natural
partition of all theories into two classes, depending on the existence
of a non-trivial Galois current. As an application, the projective
kernel of a RCFT, i.e. the set of all modular transformations represented
by scalar multiples of the identity, is described in terms of a small
set of easily computable invariants. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

A most important characteristic of a (Rational) Conformal Field Theory
is the associated modular representation \cite{Cardy}. Not only does
it prescribe the transformation of the genus one characters of the
primary fields under the modular group $\Gamma\left(1\right)=SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$,
but it does also determine the central charge (modulo 8), the fractional
part of the conformal weights, the fusion rules via Verlinde's formula,
etc.\cite{Ver,MS}. All these properties are linked to the fact that
the modular representation of an RCFT provides part of the defining
data of a modular tensor category \cite{Turaev,MTC,FRS}. 

A fundamental property of the modular representation, conjectured
by many authors over the years \cite{Moore,Eholzer,Eh-Sko,BCIR,CG2}
and finally proved in \cite{CMP}, is the congruence subgroup property:
there exists a natural number $N$ (which turns out to equal the
order of the matrix $T$ representing the Dehn-twist $\tau\mapsto\tau+1$),
such that the kernel of the modular representation contains the principal
congruence subgroup \[
\Gamma\left(N\right)=\left\{  \left(\begcc\, |\, cc\right\}  
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\left(1\right)}"
