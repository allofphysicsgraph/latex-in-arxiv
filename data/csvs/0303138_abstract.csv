We study the localized tachyon condensation of non-supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds 
in their mirror Landau-Ginzburg picture.
We first show that the  R-charges of chiral primaries increase under the process of 
condensing the tachyon in the same chiral ring. 
Then, utilizing the existence of four copies of (2,2) worldsheet supersymmetry,   
we show that  the minimal tachyon mass in twisted sectors increases in CFT and type 0 string and it plays 
the role of the c-function of the twisted sectors.
We also study the GSO projection in detail and show that type II decays to  only to type II
while type 0 can mix with type 0 and  II  under the RG-flow.
