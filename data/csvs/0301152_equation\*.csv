with $K{}_{\mathrm{ , a}}\equiv \frac{\partial K}{\partial q{}^{\mathrm{a}}}\,.$

We rewrite the above equation in terms of invariant structures:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pair}
 \underset{{V}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{}} P = \delta K\,,
\end{equation}
where $\underset{{V}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{}}$ is the \textbf{Lie derivative} along the vector $V$, and
$\delta$ is the \textbf{exterior differential} (see \cite{Nak92} for a
definition of these operators).

We call the pair $(P;\,K)$, $1$--form $P$ and $0$--form $K$, a
\textbf{standard Lagrangian pair} for $V$ if $K \neq 0$. In the special
case $K = 0$ we call $P$ a \textbf{non--standard Lagrangian }for $V$: the
latter case allows for the construction of constants of the motion in a
direct way \cite{Bus02} (see theorem \ref{thm:3}).

\begin{rem}The above objects should not be confused with the usual
``Lagrangian density"" ${{L}}[q,\,\dot{q},\,t] = P{}_{\mathrm{a}}\,\left(
\dot{q}{}^{\mathrm{a}} - V{}^{\mathrm{a}} \right)+ K\,,$ which is the thing that is
integrated in time to give the action: $S = \int {{L}}\,dt\,.$ The
$1$--form $P$ is also understood as the momentum map. \cite{Nut01} In the
special case $K=0\,,$ it solves the equation for a ``conserved covariant.""
\cite{Boi84}
\end{rem}

The general case of objects which depend explicitly on time is easily
worked out, \cite{Hoj81} but there is no need to do so in the applications
of this paper. Nevertheless, for symmetries and constants of the motion
the explicit time dependence will be necessarily taken into account. In
the sequel, we give the name \textbf{time--independent} to those objects
which do not depend \textbf{explicitly} on time, and viceversa.

The \textbf{Euler--Lagrange} equations which come from the Action
(\ref{eq:action}) are:
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma{}_{\mathrm{a b}} \left( \dot{q}{}^{\mathrm{b}} - V{}^{\mathrm{b}}\right) = 0\,,
\end{equation*}
where $\Sigma \equiv \delta P$ is the \textbf{symplectic $2$--form }or
Lagrange bracket whose components are:
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma{}_{\mathrm{a b}} =  P{}_{\mathrm{b,a}}- P{}_{\mathrm{a,b}}\,.
\end{equation*}
It is worth mentioning that, in \cite{Wit86}, a symplectic $2$--form is
induced by an Action Principle in essentially the same way we have derived
the above symplectic $2$--form from the Action Principle
(\ref{eq:action}).

Notice that these Euler--Lagrange equations do not imply the original
equations of motion (\ref{eq:motion}); instead they imply
\textbf{deformed} or mixed equations, where the deformation is represented
by an additive extra term which is an arbitrary linear combination of
vectors belonging to the \textbf{kernel} of the symplectic $2$--form. In
the case of KdV, we will obtain the deformations explicitly. See
\cite{Bus02} for examples in the finite dimensional case.

The symplectic $2$--form associated to this Action Principle is easily
seen to satisfy
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber \delta\, \Sigma &=& 0 {\textrm{\quad (closure)}}\\
\label{eq:symp2} \underset{{V}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{\,}} \Sigma &=& 0\,,
\end{eqnarray}
therefore the inverse process could be done: starting from a symplectic
$2$--form $\Sigma$ for the flow vector $V$, we construct the standard
Lagrangian $1$--form, from $\delta\,P = \Sigma$ and the $0$--form $K$ is
obtained by integration of equation (\ref{eq:pair}). This process suffers
from technical difficulties, which increase when the objects are infinite
dimensional and nonlocal. Fortunately, for the KdV equation there is a
constructive way of finding the Action Principles (see theorems
\ref{thm:1} and \ref{thm:2}).

\subsection{Hamiltonian theories are induced from Symplectic Structures}

The relationship of the symplectic $2$--form with the Hamiltonian
formulation is very simple: \cite{Olv93} consider the formal inverse
(i.e., except for a finite kernel that the operators may possess) of the
above $2$--form, the time--independent $(2,0)$ tensor $J$ such that
$J\cdot \Sigma = \mathbb{I}\,.$ It is possible to show that $\Sigma$ is
closed if and only if $J$ satisfies the \textbf{Jacobi identity}, which we
write in the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Jac}
  \underset{{J\cdot U}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{J}} = J\cdot \delta U\cdot J\,,\quad \forall \,\,1\textrm{--form }\,U\,.
\end{equation}
$J$ is known as a Hamiltonian operator or Poisson bracket. Now, equation
(\ref{eq:symp2}) implies $\underset{{V}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{\,J}} = 0\,.$ Therefore, according to the
Jacobi Identity (\ref{eq:Jac}), a Hamiltonian theory for the flow $V$ is
induced by the symplectic $2$--form $\Sigma$: the equation $V=J\cdot U$
implies $\delta U=0$, thus $V = J\cdot \delta H\,,$ where $H$ is the
Hamiltonian, a time--independent $0$--form.

\subsection{Symmetries}

Symmetries play a crucial role in the construction of the Action
Principles. A symmetry for the system (\ref{eq:motion}) is known as a
vector with components ${\eta}^{\mathrm{a}}$ that takes solutions into solutions
of equation (\ref{eq:motion}), in the sense that given any solution
${q}^{\textrm{a}}(t)$ such that $\dot{q}^{\textrm{a}}(t) =
V^{\textrm{a}}[q^{\textrm{b}}(t)]\,,$ then $"
