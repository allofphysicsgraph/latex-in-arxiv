In this paper we obtain strings that propagate in the quantized pp-wave
backgrounds. We can obtain these strings from the solutions of membrane.
The other way is the propagation of a massless string in a spacetime
with two time dimensions. This string sweeps a worldvolume,
which enables us to obtain other strings in the quantized
pp-wave backgrounds in the spacetime with one time direction. The
associated algebras and Hamiltonians of these massive strings
will be studied.
