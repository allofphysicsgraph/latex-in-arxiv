It is shown that the four-particle amplitude of superstring theory
at two loops obtained in \cite{AllZhu1,AllZhu3} is equivalent to
the previously obtained results in \cite{IengoZhu2, IengoZhu3,
Zhu}. Here the ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry in hyperelliptic Riemann
surface plays an important role in the proof.
