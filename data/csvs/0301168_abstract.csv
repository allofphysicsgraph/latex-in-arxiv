We study cosmological aspects of braneworld models with a warped
dimension and an arbitrary number of compact dimensions. With a
stabilized radion, a number of different cosmological bulk
solutions are found in a general case. Both one and
two brane models are considered. The Friedmann equation is
calculated in each case. Particular attention is paid to six dimensional models
where we find that the usual Friedmann equation can typically be
recovered without fine-tuning.
