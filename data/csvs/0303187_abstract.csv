Inspired by factorized scattering from delta--type impurities in
(1+1)-dimen\-sional space-time, we propose and analyse a generalization
of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra. Distinguished elements of the
new algebra, called reflection and transmission generators, encode the
particle--impurity interactions. We describe in detail the underlying
algebraic structure. The relative Fock representations are
explicitly constructed and a general factorized scattering theory
is developed in this framework.
