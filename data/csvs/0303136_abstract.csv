We consider topology changing processes in SU(2)--Higgs theory.
In the Standard Model of particle physics they are accompanied by baryon--
and lepton--number non--conservation.
At fixed energy and multiplicity of initial state, these processes 
are described by classical 
$\theta$--instanton solutions. We describe these solutions and calculate 
the suppression
exponents for the probabilities of the topology changing transitions
at relatively low energies.
