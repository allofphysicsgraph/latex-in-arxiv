A number of physical systems exhibit asymptotic conformal invariance.
Within a particular range of distances, they are characterized by an inverse square 
potential, the absence of dimensional scales, and an SO(2,1) symmetry algebra. Examples 
ranging from molecular physics to black holes are provided. For such systems, 
 quantum symmetry breaking---revealed by the failure of the symmetry 
generators to close the algebra---is shown
to be independent of the renormalization procedure.
