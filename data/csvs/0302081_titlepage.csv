RR fluxes representing different cohomology classes may correspond to the same twisted K-theory class.  We argue that such fluxes are related by monodromies, generalizing and sometimes T-dual to the familiar monodromies of a D7-brane.  A generalized ``theta angle'' is also transformed, but changes by a multiple of 2$\pi$.  As an application, NS5-brane monodromies modify the twisted K-theory classification of fluxes.  Furthermore, in the noncompact case K-theory does not distinguish flux configurations in which $dG$ is nontrivial in compactly supported cohomology.  Such fluxes are realized as the decay products of unstable D-branes that wrapped nontrivial cycles.  This is interpreted using the $E_8$ bundle formalism.
