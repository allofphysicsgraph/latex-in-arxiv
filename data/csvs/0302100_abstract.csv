The spectrum of the Dirac Hamiltonian in the background of
crossing vortices is studied. To exploit the index theorem, and in
analogy to the lattice the space-time manifold is chosen to be
the four-torus $\T^4$. For sake of simplicity we consider two idealized 
cases: infinitely fat and infinitely thin transversally intersecting
vortices. The time-dependent spectrum
of the Dirac Hamiltonian is calculated and in particular the 
influence of the vortex crossing on the quark spectrum is investigated.
