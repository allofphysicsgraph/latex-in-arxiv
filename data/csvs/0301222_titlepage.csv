\begin{abstract}
By treating the bulk--quantized Yang--Mills theory as a constrained
system we obtain a consistent gauge--fixed BRST hamiltonian
in the minimal sector.  This provides an independent
derivation of  the 5--$d$ lagrangian bulk action.
The ground state is independent of the (anti)ghosts
and is interpreted as the solution
of the Fokker--Planck equation, thus establishing a
direct connection to the Fokker--Planck hamiltonian.
The vacuum state correlators are shown to be in agreement
with correlators in lagrangian 5--$d$ formulation.
It is verified  that the complete propagators  remain parabolic
in one--loop dimensional regularization.
