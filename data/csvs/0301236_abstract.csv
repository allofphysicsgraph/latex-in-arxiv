The dualised formulation of the symmetric space sigma model is peformed
 for a general scalar coset $G/K$ where $G$ is a maximally non-compact 
 group and $K$ it's maximal compact subgroup.By using the twisted self-duality 
 condition the general form of the first-order equations 
 are obtained.The results are applied to the example of $SL(2,\mathbb{R)}$ /$SO(2)$ 
 scalar manifold of the IIB supergravity.
