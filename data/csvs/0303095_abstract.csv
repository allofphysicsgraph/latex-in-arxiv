Cosmological consequences of the brane world 
scenario are reviewed in a pedagogical manner. According to 
the brane world idea, the standard model particles are 
confined on a hyper--surface (a so--called brane), which is embedded in a 
higher--dimensional spacetime (the so--called bulk). We begin our review with
the simplest consistent brane world model: a single brane 
embedded in a five--dimensional 
Anti-de Sitter space--time. Then we include a scalar field 
in the bulk and discuss in detail the difference with
the Anti-de Sitter case.  The geometry of 
the bulk space--time is also analysed in some depth. Finally, we investigate  
the cosmology of a system with two branes and a bulk scalar 
field. We comment on brane collisions and summarize some open 
problems of brane world cosmology.
