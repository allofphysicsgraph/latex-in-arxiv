We can rewrite the first two equations defining, as usual \cite{CDSW} \cite{Seiberg}, the two polynomials ($k=1,2$) 
\be
\label{deff}
f_{(k)}(z) = -\frac{1}{8\pi^2} \tr \frac{W'_{(k)}(\Phi_k)-W'_{(k)}(z)}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}

All terms containing two fields in the bifundamental 
cancel if we 
take the sum of the first two equations in (\ref{eq:anomalia1}) minus the 
third one. As a result we obtain

\label{quadraticaa2}
W'_{(1)}(z)R_{(1)}(z)+\frac{1}{4}f_{(1)}(z) + W'_{(2)}(z)R_{(2)}(z)+\frac{1}{4}f_{(2)}(z) + R_{(1)}(z) 
R_{(2)}(z) = R_{(1)}(z)^2 + R_{(2)}(z)^2

which is quadratic in $R_{(k)}(z)$.

{\noindent {\it Cubic equation}}
\vspace{12pt}

The cubic equation can be derived in a similar way, considering a little more
 complicated transformations 
\begin{align}
\delta \Phi_{(1)}=&   \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha {\cal W}^\alpha}{z-\Phi_{(1)}} 
X \bar{X} \nonumber \\
\delta \Phi_{(2)}=& \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha{\cal W}^\alpha}
{z-\Phi_{(2)}} \bar{X} X  \\
\delta X=& \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha{\cal W}^\alpha}
{z-\Phi_{(1)}} X \bar{X} X \frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(2)}} \nonumber
\end{align}

Again we write the corresponding anomaly equations 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:anomalia2}
- \frac{1}{32\pi^2} \tr& \left( W'_{(1)}(\Phi_{(1)})
\frac{\ensuremath{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(1)}}

-\bar{X} X 
\frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)}{\cal W}^{{(2)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(2)}}
\bar{X}X \right) = \nonumber \\
\qquad= -&\frac{1}{32\pi^2} R_{(2)}(z) \tr  X \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)} 
{\cal W}^{{(2)}\alpha}} {z-\Phi_{(2)}} \bar{X} 
\end{align}
\begin{align}
- \frac{1}{32\pi^2} \tr& \left( X \bar{X} 
\frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(1)}{\cal W}^{{(1)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(1)}} X \bar{X}
- \bar{X} X \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)}{\cal W}^{{(2)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(2)}}
\bar{X} X \right) = \nonumber \\ 
\qquad =-&\frac{1}{32\pi^2} \left( R_{(1)}(z)\tr X \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)} 
{\cal W}^{{(2)}\alpha}} {z-\Phi_{(2)}} \bar{X} + R_{(2)}(z) \tr\bar{X}
\frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(1)}{\cal W}^{{(1)}\alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(1)}} X \right).
\nonumber
\end{align}

As in (\ref{deff}), we define two polynomials
\begin{align}
g_{(1)}(z) &= -\frac{1}{8\pi^2} \tr \left( \frac{W'_{(1)}(\Phi_{(1)})-W'_{(1)}
(z)}{z-\Phi_{(1)}}
{\cal W}_\alpha^{(1)}{\cal W}^{{(1)}\alpha} X\bar{X}\right) \nonumber\\
g_{(2)}(z) &= -\frac{1}{8\pi^2} \tr \left( \frac{W'_{(2)}(\Phi_{(2)})-W'_{(2)}
(z)}{z-\Phi_{(2)}}
{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)}{\cal W}^{{(2)}\alpha} \bar{X}X\right) 
\end{align} 
to eliminate the terms $W'_k(\Phi_k)$ from the first two Ward identities 
(\ref{eq:anomalia2}), and make use of (\ref{A2XX}) to rewrite the operators
 that depend 
only on two bifundamentals in terms of the resolvents 
$R_{(k)}(z)$. Finally we cancel the operators with four 
bifundamentals subtracting the third equation of (\ref{eq:anomalia2}) from the 
sum of the first two. The result is the cubic equation
\begin{align}
\label{cubicaa2}
&R_{(1)}(z)^2R_{(2)}(z)- R_{(1)}(z)R_{(2)}(z)^2 = W'_{(1)}(z) 
\left( R_{(1)}(z)^2 - W'_{(1)}(z) R_{(1)}(z) 
-\frac{1}{4} f_{(1)}(z) \right)+ \nonumber \\
&-  W'_{(2)}(z) \left( R_{(2)}(z)^2 - W'_{(2)}(z) R_{(2)}(z) 
-\frac{1}{4} f_{(2)}(z) \right) + \frac{1}{4} g_{(1)}(z)+
\frac{1}{4} g_{(2)}(z).
\end{align}

{\noindent {\it Spectral curve}}
\vspace{12pt}

Following \cite{Dijkgraaf:2002vw} and \cite{Lazaroiu} we may use (\ref{quadraticaa2}) and (\ref{cubicaa2}) to write a cubic equation whose roots are related to the resolvents $R_{(1)}$ and $R_{(2)}$. In the limit of turning off the tree potential for the adjoint fields, in which we should recover ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry \cite{Cach}, after going on-shell (e.g. minimizing the effective superpotential), this equation should be related with the Seiberg-Witten curve for $A_2$ quiver theories.

%DA QUI IN POI RIVEDERE

We can eliminate terms linear in $R_{(k)}$ from the quadratic equation (\ref{quadraticaa2}) making 
the following change of variables: 
\begin{align}
a_{(1)}(z)&= R_{(1)}(z) - \frac{2}{3} W'_{(1)}(z) - \frac{1}{3} W'_{(2)}(z) \nonumber \\
a_{(2)}(z)&= -R_{(2)}(z) + \frac{1}{3} W'_{(1)}(z) + \frac{2}{3} W'_{(2)}(z).
\end{align}

With this choice the two equations are:
\begin{align}\label{modeq}
a_{(1)}(z)^2 + a_{(2)}(z)^2 +a_{(1)}(z)a_{(2)}(z) - p^{(2)}(z) = 0 \nonumber \\
a_{(1)}(z)^2 a_{(2)}(z) + a_{(1)}(z) a_{(2)}(z)^2 + p^{(3)}(z) = 0
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
p^{(2)}(z) \equiv \,&t_{(1)}(z)^2 -  t_{(1)}(z)t_{(2)}(z)+t_{(2)}(z)^2 +\frac{1}{4} f_{(1)}(z) +\frac{1}{4}f_{(2)}(z) 
\nonumber \\
p^{(3)}(z) \equiv &-t_{(1)}(z)t_{(2)}(z)( t_{(1)}(z)- t_{(2)}(z) ) +\frac{1}{4} t_{(1)}(z)f_{(2)}(z) 
-\frac{1}{4} t_{(2)}(z)f_{(1)}(z)+\\\nonumber&+
\frac{1}{4}g_{(1)}(z) +\frac{1}{4} g_{(2)}(z)
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
t_{(1)}(z) &\equiv \frac{2}{3} W'_{(1)}(z) + \frac{1}{3} W'_{(2)}(z) \nonumber \\
t_{(2)}(z) &\equiv \frac{1}{3} W'_{(1)}(z) + \frac{2}{3} W'_{(2)}(z).
\end{align}
If we define 
\be
a_{(3)} \equiv -a_{(1)} - a_{(2)}
\end{equation}
equations (\ref{modeq}) can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
&\sum_{i<j}^3 a_{(i)} a_{(j)}=p^{(2)} \nonumber \\
&\sum_{i<j<k}^3a_{(i)}a_{(j)}a_{(k)} =p^{(3)}  
\end{align}
which are the conditions satisfied by the three roots $a_{(i)}$ of a cubic equation of the form
\be
y^3+ p^{(2)}y - p^{(3)}=0.
\end{equation}
This is exactly the curve suggested in \cite{Dijkgraaf:2002vw} and calculated from the matrix model in \cite{Lazaroiu}.

\setcounter{equation}{0}\section{Generalization to $A_{n}$}\label{general}
An interesting problem is to generalize the procedure we followed in the simple case $A_2$
to the more involved $A_n$ quiver theory, with $n$ generic. Even though the problem seems
too complicated to make it possible to give an answer for the general case, we will write the exact quadratic and cubic 
equations for the resolvents, obtain the expectation values of operators with two insertions 
of field strength and two or four bifundamental fields, and sketch a general procedure to obtain all
the equations for a fixed value of $n$.

\vspace{12pt}
{\it Quadratic equation}
\vspace{12pt}




We consider the following transformations for the adjoint matter fields
\be\label{adj}
\delta\Phi_{(k)}=\frac{{\cal W}_{\alpha}^{(k)}{\cal W}^{(k)\alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}
\ee
These variations are the analogue of the variations considered in \cite{CDSW}, for the case of the direct product of different gauge groups.
From (\ref{konishi}) we obtain the following equations $(k=2,\ldots n-1)$
\begin{align}
&{W}^\prime_{(k)}(z)R_{(k)}(z)+\frac{1}{4}f_{(k)}(z)-\frac{1}{32\pi^2}\left( \tr\bar{X} \k X-\tr X \k\bar{X}\right)  =\label{anadjk}\\&\qquad\qquad=R_{(k)}(z)^2\nonumber\\
&{W}^\prime_{(1)}(z)R_{(1)}(z)+\frac{1}{4}f_{(1)}(z)-\frac{1}{32\pi^2}\tr\bar{X}\p1 X = R_{(1)}(z)^2\label{anadj1}\\
&{W}^\prime_{(n)}(z)R_{(n)}(z)+\frac{1}{4}f_{(n)}(z)+\frac{1}{32\pi^2}\tr X\pn\bar{X} =R_{(n)}(z)^2 \label{anadjn}
\end{align}
where, as for $A_2$, we have defined the holomorphic polynomial functions of degree $n_{k}-1$
\be\label{fz}
f_{(k)}(z)\equiv -\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\tr\left(  \frac{ W^\prime_{(k)}(\Phi_{(k)})-W^\prime_{(k)}(z)}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}{\cal W}_{\alpha}^{(k)}{\cal W}^{(k)\alpha}\right)
\ee
Taking the sum of all of the above equations (\ref{anadjk})-(\ref{anadjn}) we find
\be\label{quad1}
\sum_{k=1}^n\left(\!W^\prime_{(k)}R_{(k)}\!+\!\frac{1}{4}f_{(k)} \right) -\frac{1}{32\pi^2}\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\tr \!\left(\bar{X}\k X\!-\!X\pk1\bar{X}   \right)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}R_{(k)}^2
\ee
where the $z$-dependence of the holomorphic functions $W^\prime_{(k)}(z)$, $R_{(k)}(z)$ and $f_{(k)}(z)$ is understood.

The $X$-$\bar{X}$ and $\bar{X}$-$X$ traces may be evaluated using the anomaly generated by
\be\label{bifund}
\delta X_{k,k+1}=\frac{{\cal W}_{\alpha}^{(k)}{\cal W}^{(k)\alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}X_{k,k+1}\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k+1)}}
\ee

Equation (\ref{bifund}) is peculiar of bifundamental fields: since we want to perturb 
the link between the $k^{th}$ and $(k+1)^{th}$ nodes of the quiver, we deform the 
two extrema of the link using adjoint fields\footnote{Note that because of the chiral
 ring relations (\ref{crbif}) and (\ref{cradj}), we would have obtained the same transformation 
 by moving one or both field strengths on the right of $X_{k,k+1}$.} and glue them with 
 bifundamentals.

Using the second of (\ref{konishi}) and (\ref{identity}) we find
\be\label{anbif}
-\fr\tr\bar{X}\k X+\fr\tr X\pk1\bar{X}=R_{(k)}R_{(k+1)}
\ee

substituting into (\ref{quad1}) we finally get
\be
\sum_{k=1}^n\left(W^\prime_{(k)}(z)R_{(k)}(z)+\frac{1}{4}f_{(k)}(z)\right)+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}R_{(k)}(z)R_{(k+1)}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^n R_{(k)}(z)^2
\ee
which is the quadratic equation for the resolvents of a generic $A_n$ quiver theory.

The equations we have written so far can also be used to evaluate the expectation values of the $X$-$\bar{X}$ and $\bar{X}$-$X$ trace operators. In fact we can use (\ref{anadj1}) to obtain
\be
-\fr\tr\bar{X}\p1 X =R_{(1)}^2(z)-W^\prime_{(1)}(z)R_{(1)}(z)-\frac{1}{4}f_{(1)}(z)
\ee

Plugging this result into (\ref{anbif}) with $k=1$ we can then obtain $\tr X \frac{{\cal WW}}{z-\Phi_{(2)}}\bar{X}$, which can in turn be used into (\ref{anadjk}) for $k=2$, and so on. The final result is
\be
\begin{split}
-&\fr\tr\bar{X}\k X=\sum_{p=1}^{k}\left(R_{(p)}^2-W^\prime_{(p)}R_{(p)}-\frac{1}{4}f_{(p)}- R_{(p-1)}R_{(p)}\right)\\
-&\fr\tr X\pk1 \bar{X}=\sum_{p=1}^{k}\left(R_{(p)}^2-W^\prime_{(p)}R_{(p)}-\frac{1}{4}f_{(p)}- R_{(p)}R_{(p+1)}\right)
\end{split}
\ee


\vspace{12pt}
{\noindent\it Cubic equation}
\vspace{12pt}

As for the $A_2$ theory, to obtain an equation which is cubic in the resolvents, 
we need to consider more complicated transformations for $\phi$, $X$ and $\bar{X}$. 
We thus add a $X$-$\bar{X}$ couple to the transformations (\ref{adj}) and (\ref{bifund}). 
There is more than one way to do so, because $\Phi$, $X$ and $\bar{X}$ do not commute: for 
the $\Phi$ variation we could put one of the two impurities on the left of the adjoint block 
and one on the right, or both on either side, while for the $X$ variation we could use any of 
the combinations of two $X$'s and one $\bar{X}$ between the two adjoint blocks. We will first 
rule out some of these possibilities, and then keep all of the remaining and calculate the anomaly 
equations for all of them: they will be just enough to obtain a cubic equation and evaluate the 
expectation values of all 4-$X$ operators.

First of all, we will not consider the adjoint transformations having one link\footnote{By link we mean an $X$ or an $\bar{X}$ insertion either in the reparameterizations of the adjoint and bifundamental fields, or in the trace operators.} on 
the left and one on the right. This is obvious since to build such a variation the adjoint 
field we insert must be different from the adjoint field we are varying 
(e.g. $\delta\Phi_k=X\frac{{\cal WW}}{z-\Phi_{k+1}}\bar{X}$), thus the quantum contribution 
to the anomaly (the commutator part in the first of (\ref{konishi})) vanishes, and only the 
classical part contributes, which is telling us nothing more about the low energy dynamics of 
the theory, than the classical equations of motion do. The choices with both $X$ and $\bar{X}$ on 
the left, or both of them on the right are actually equivalent because of the cyclicity of the trace (\ref{cicl}). 
Thus we are left with only two possible variations for the adjoint fields, which correspond to the two 
orderings of the pair $(X,\bar{X})$ on the right of the adjoint block.

The variations we consider are then
\begin{subequations}\label{cubicvar}
\be
\label{a} \delta\Phi_{(k)}=\k X\bar{X}
\ee\be
\label{b} \delta\Phi_{(k)}=\k \bar{X}X
\ee\be
\label{c} \delta X_{k,k+1}=\k X\bar{X}X\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k+1)}}
\ee\be
\label{d} \delta X_{k,k+1}=\k\bar{X}XX\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k+1)}}
\ee\be
\label{e} \delta X_{k,k+1}=\k XX\bar{X}\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k+1)}}
\ee\be
\label{f} \delta \bar{X}_{k+1,k}=\pk1 \bar{X}X\bar{X}\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}
\ee\be
\label{g} \delta \bar{X}_{k+1,k}=\pk1 \bar{X}\bar{X}X\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}
\ee\be
\label{h} \delta \bar{X}_{k+1,k}=\pk1 X\bar{X}\bar{X}\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}

Given these Ward identities, all we need to do to write the cubic equation for
 the resolvents is to arrange a chain of variations (\ref{cubicvar}) so as to
 cancel all operators with four links. We start with the identity associated
 with (\ref{a}, $k=1$) which gives the operator 
$\tr X\bar{X}\frac{{\cal WW}}{z-\Phi_{(1)}} X\bar{X}$. If we add the identities
 for (\ref{c}, $k=1$), (\ref{b}, $k=2$), (\ref{d}, $k=2$), subtract the one
 for (\ref{g}, $k=2$) and add the relation coming from (\ref{a}, $k=2$) we end
 up again with an operator of the same form as the first one, but with 
$\Phi_{(2)}$ instead of $\Phi_{(1)}$. It is obvious now how we should go on:
 we add the same chain as before, $n-2$ more times, each time increasing all 
$k$'s by one, and end up with an expression in the $R_{(k)}$'s and
 $W^\prime_{(k)}$'s, with $X$ and $\bar{X}$ appearing only in
 $\tr X\bar{X}\frac{{\cal WW}}{z-\Phi_{(n-1)}} X\bar{X}$. At this point we add
 the equation for (\ref{c}, $k=n-1$) and are left with
 $\tr \bar{X}X\frac{{\cal WW}}{z-\Phi_{(n)}} \bar{X}X$, but this is exactly
 the only four-link operator appearing in (\ref{wc}), thus adding this last
 identity to our previous relation we find an equation that involves only
 $R_{(k)}(z)$, $W^\prime_{(k)}(z)$ and the polynomials $f(z)$

where the $z$ dependence is understood. This is the cubic equation we were looking for, which is obtained by the chain of reparameterizations

\be
\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}(\delta\Phi_{(k)}^a+\delta X_{k,k+1}^c+\delta\Phi_{k+1}^b)+\sum_{k=2}^{n-1}(\delta X_{k,k+1}^d-\delta\bar{X}_{k+1,k}^g)
\ee

It is to notice that while for the variations that entered this chain we had to use all allowed $k$'s, some other reparameterizations never appeared at all. This might seem to suggest that generalization to higher order equations would need a case-by-case analysis to decide which transformations are useful in the process, and which are not. Based on the experience gained in writing the general cubic equation, in the next subsection we will suggest which reparameterizations are necessary, and which are redundant.

With the case of $A_2$ in mind, we can look for a change of variables which cancels, in the quadratic equation (\ref{quad1}), the terms linear in the 
resolvent. The new variables are:
\begin{align}
a_1 &\equiv - \sum_{p=1}^n \left( 1 - \frac{p}{n+1} \right) q_p \nonumber \\
a_k &\equiv - \sum_{p=k}^n q_p + \sum_{p=1}^n \frac{p}{n+1} q_p
\end{align}
for $k=2,...,n+1$, and where the $q_p$ are defined, in terms of the resolvent and the Cartan matrix $C_{qr}$ associated to the quiver, as
\begin{equation}
q_p = W'_p - C_{pr} R_r.
\end{equation} 


In terms of the $a_{(i)}$, the $n$ equations satisfied by the resolvents of $A_n$ should become very simple   
if the curve underlying the quiver has the form suggested in \cite{Dijkgraaf:2002vw}:
\be\label{curvan}
(y-a_{(1)})(y-a_{(2)})...(y-a_{(n+1)})=0.
\end{equation}
As a consequence, the equation of order $k$ $(k=3,...,n+1)$ should be
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i_1<...<i_k}^{n+1} a_{(i_1)}...a_{(i_k)} = 
\mathrm{polynomial,~of~degree~}k \mathrm{,~built~with~} W_{(i)} 
\mathrm{~and~} f_{(i)} 
\end{equation}  
We checked this is the form of the cubic equation (\ref{cubicaAn}) in the new variables, which is an indication that the curve (\ref{curvan}) is correct.

{\it Vacuum expectation values of $4$-link operators}
\vspace{12pt}

The procedure we have just described also allows us to obtain expectation values for trace operators with four links. In fact at any intermediate step of the previous chain only one of these operators appeared at a time. As our previous observation already pointed out, not all of four-link operators can be reached this way, nonetheless there is a way to evaluate also their expectation values: this is where the Ward identities that didn't play a role in the anomaly chain, become necessary, as we will show.

For the operators in the chain, the expectation values are given by\footnote{Obviously the first identity in all expressions is not formally correct. It should be interpreted as representing the Ward identities we have to sum up to calculate the expectation value of the operator.}

\end{subequations}

As can be seen from (\ref{Xe}), $\tr X\bar{X}\frac{\cal WW}{z-\Phi_{(k)}} \bar{X}X$ and $\tr\bar{X}X \frac{\cal WW}{z-\Phi_{(k)}} X\bar{X}$ have the same expectation values. This could already be seen by taking the difference of equations (\ref{wf}) and (\ref{wi}).
There is only one four-link operator whose expectation value could not be determined through the reparameterization that appeared in the chain. This can be determined, though, using (\ref{wg}) or (\ref{wj}) which by (\ref{Xe}) are equivalent. We have thus used all variations but two: (\ref{f}) and one of (\ref{e}) or (\ref{h}). As we will demonstrate in the next subsection, it is a general fact that variations like (\ref{c}) and (\ref{f}), which we will call alternating, give the same Ward identity.



\vspace{12pt}
{\noindent \it Outlook of the general procedure}
\vspace{12pt}


Based on the experience we gained in writing the general form of the quadratic and cubic equations for the resolvents, in this section we give some hints on how to write all the equations up to the $(n+1)^{\mathrm{th}}$ grade for a $A_n$ quiver theory, even though we won't be able to evaluate them explicitly.

First of all we want to give a rule that tells us which are the relevant reparameterizations we have to use.

It is a general feature of alternating perturbations, that is perturbations whose chain is an alternating array of $X$'s and $\bar{X}$'s, to give the same Ward identities. In fact, let us consider a generic degree $p$ alternating chain
\be
\begin{split}
&\delta X_{k,k+1}=\k X(\bar{X}X)^p\pk1 \\
&\delta \bar{X}_{k+1,k}=\pk1 \bar{X}(X\bar{X})^p\k 
\end{split}
\ee
then it is easy to show that both variations lead to the same Ward identity
\be
\begin{split}
-&\tr\pk1(\bar{X}X)^{p+1}+\tr \k(X\bar{X})^{p+1}=\\&=-\fr\sum_{m=0}^{p}\tr\k(X\bar{X})^m\cdot \tr\pk1(\bar{X}X)^{p-m}
\end{split}
\ee
One of these variations is then redundant, and must be neglected.

Let us now define a conjugation relation among $\delta X$ and $\delta \bar{X}$
 transformations: we say that a $\delta X$ and a $\delta \bar{X}$ variations 
are conjugated if the $X$-$\bar{X}$ chain of either can be obtained from the 
other's by inverting it and taking the ``complex conjugate'' (e.g. (\ref{d})
 and (\ref{g}) are conjugated in this sense). A $\delta X_{k,k+1}$ variation will contain as many $\bar{X}_{k+1,k}$ factors as ${X}_{k,k+1}$  are present in the $\delta\bar{X}_{k+1,k}$ conjugated variation, and, moreover, they are in specular positions. Thus the right hand side of the Ward identities (\ref{konishi}) generated by this pair will contain the same number of elements, and the number of links in each of the two factors of each element will be equal.

There is even more to this: the right hand side of the two Ward identities will be equal. In fact let us consider an $X_{k,k+1}$ field in the $\delta X_{k,k+1}$ variation, on both sides of it there will be an equal number of $X$ and $\bar{X}$ fields (even though the number of pairs on one side will in general be different from the number on the other side), because we are left with two fields in the adjoint one of $U(N_k)$ and the other of $U(N_{k+1})$. Let us now consider its image $\bar{X}_{k+1,k}$ through the conjugation operation. The same will be true for this field also, with representations exchanged. Now, because of the way we have defined conjugation, the subarray on the left of $X_{k,k+1}$ will be equal to the subarray on the right of $\bar{X}_{k+1,k}$ and viceversa. Let us make an example: we consider a general variation $\delta X_{k,k+1}$ and its conjugated partner and indicate with a hat the two conjugated links
\be
\begin{split}
&\delta X_{k,k+1}=\k X_{k,k+1}X\bar{X}\bar{X}\hat{X}_{k,k+1}X\bar{X}\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k+1)}}\\
&\delta\bar{X}_{k+1,k}=\pk1 X\bar{X}\hat{\bar{X}}_{k+1,k}XX\bar{X}\bar{X}_{k+1,k}\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}
\end{split}
\ee

Thus taking the difference of the equations we obtain from two conjugated variations, gives an identity for four-link operators.

Unfortunately, we are not able to give an {\it a priori} prescription which tells us which conjugated pairs will give the same four-link identity. This will have to be checked case by case.

Once all variations and Ward identities have been written, it is not hard to write a $(k+2)^{th}$ degree equation involving only the resolvents. Let us suppose we have written the $(k+1)^{th}$ degree equation, and have evaluated the expectation values of all operators with $k$ pairs of bifundamentals. Then we only have to sum all reparameterizations for the adjoint fields and alternating transformations for $X$ containing $k$ couples $X$-$\bar{X}$, use the $(2k+2)$-link identities we have obtained from conjugated pairs, and make use of lower-degree equations. What we obtain is the $(k+2)^{th}$-degree equation for the resolvents of a $A_n$ ($n>k+1$) quiver theory.

\section{Affine $\hat{A}_1$ quiver}
The techniques developed in the previous sections can be
applied also to  affine quiver gauge theories.

Again we start by considering the simple case of $\hat{A}_1$ with
gauge group $U(N_1) \times U(N_2)$. In this case the number of
bifundamental fields is exactly two times the number of bifundamentals in the
$A_2$ theory; we call them $X_i$, $\bar{X}_i$ $i=1,2$.

The condition (\ref{condWaff}) on the superpotential implies 
\be\label{Wtotnullo}
W_2(x)=-W_1(x)\equiv -W(x).
\ee 
and the superpotential  (\ref{superpotential}) may be written as
\be
W_{tree}=\tr\left(W(\Phi_{(1)})-W(\Phi_{(2)})+\bar{X}_1\Phi_{(1)}X_{1}-X_1\Phi_{(2)}\bar{X}_{1}+X_2\Phi_{(2)}\bar{X}_{2}-\bar{X}_2\Phi_{(1)}X_{2} \right)
\ee   

In \cite{DVdec} it is showed that the matrix model associated to the
$\hat{A}_1$ quiver only depends on the combination
\be
S = S_1 -S_2,
\ee
where $S_k = g_s M_k$ for $k=1,2$ and $M_k$ is the rank of matrices
$\Phi_k$, and consequently that the planar loop equation is
identical to that of the bosonic one matrix model
\cite{Dijkgraaf:2002fc}: 
\be 
y^2 - W'(x)^2 +f(x)=0.  
\ee

In the following we reobtain the same result directly via a field theory
computation, using the variations of matter fields and the anomaly
equations introduced in section \ref{A2}. Indeed we will prove that
the difference of the resolvents $R_{(1)}(z) - R_{(2)}(z)$ satisfies the
quadratic equation of the $U(N)$ gauge theory with an adjoint $\Phi$:
\be\label{quadaffine} 
W'(z)\left( R_{(1)}(z) - R_{(2)}(z) \right) +\frac{1}{4}f(z) = 
\left( R_{(1)}(z) - R_{(2)}(z) \right)^2.
\ee


The anomaly equations that come from $\delta \Phi_{(1)}$ and $\delta \Phi_{(2)}$ are the same as 
(\ref{eq:anomalia1}) with the condition (\ref{Wtotnullo}):
\begin{align}
\label{eq:anomaff1}
 W'(z)R_{(1)}(z) + \frac{1}{4}f_1(z) -\fr\tr\bar{X}_1\p1 X_1 + \frac{1}{32\pi^2} \tr  \bar{X}_2 
\frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(1)} 
{\cal W}^{{(1)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(1)}} X_2  =& R_{(1)}^2(z) \nonumber \\  
  -W'(z)R_{(2)}(z) -\frac{1}{4}f_2(z) +\fr\tr X_1\frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)} 
{\cal W}^{{(2)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(2)}} \bar{X}_1- \frac{1}{32\pi^2} \tr X_2 
\frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)} 
{\cal W}^{{(2)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(2)}} \bar{X}_2  \!=& R_{(2)}^2(z) 
\end{align}
where $f_k(z)$ is defined as usual.

The equations from $\delta X_1$ and $\delta X_2$ are
\begin{align}
\label{eq:anomaffine}
- \frac{1}{32\pi^2} \tr
 \bar{X}_1 \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(1)} 
{\cal W}^{{(1)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(1)}} X_1 +\fr\tr X_1 \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)} 
{\cal W}^{{(2)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(2)}} \bar{X}_1  =& R_{(1)}(z) R_{(2)}(z)\\
 \frac{1}{32\pi^2} \tr
 \bar{X}_2 \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(1)} 
{\cal W}^{{(1)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(1)}} X_2 -\fr\tr X_2 \frac{{\cal W}_\alpha^{(2)} 
{\cal W}^{{(2)} \alpha}}{z-\Phi_{(2)}} \bar{X}_2  =& R_{(1)}(z) R_{(2)}(z).
\end{align}

Summing the two equations (\ref{eq:anomaff1}) and subtracting both (\ref{eq:anomaffine}), we obtain, as expected, equation (\ref{quadaffine}) with $f(z)=f_1(z)-f_2(z)$.

To write the cubic equation we consider the variations
\begin{subequations}
\be
\delta\Phi_{(1),i}=\p1 X_i\bar{X}_i
\ee
\be
\delta\Phi_{(2),i}=\pW2 \bar{X}_i X_i
\ee
\be
\delta X_1=\p1 X_1 \bar{X}_1 X_1 \pW2
\ee
\be
\delta X_2=\p1 X_2 \bar{X}_2 X_2 \pW2
\ee
\be
\delta X_1=\p1 X_2 \bar{X}_2 X_1 \pW2
\ee
\be
\delta \bar{X}_1=\pW2 \bar{X}_1 X_2 \bar{X}_2 \p1
\ee
\be
\delta X_1=\p1 X_1 \bar{X}_2 X_2 \pW2
\ee
\be
\delta \bar{X}_1=\pW2 \bar{X}_2 X_2 \bar{X}_1 \p1
\ee
\end{subequations}

We do not write explicitly the Ward identities for these variations, since they are very similar to the equations we wrote for the non-affine $A_2$ theory, and moreover in the next section we write the explicit form of the cubic equation for generic $n$.

When we combine these Ward identities to give a cubic equation, we find that all resolvent dependences cancel, and we are eventually left with an equation for the polynomials $g_{(k,i)}(z)$
\begin{equation}
g_{(1,1)}(z)+g_{(1,2)}(z)+g_{(2,1)}(z)+g_{(2,2)}(z)=0
\end{equation}
where
\be\begin{split}
&g_{(1,i)}(z)\equiv \fr\tr\left(\frac{W^\prime_{(1)}(\Phi_{(1)})-W^\prime_{(1)}(z)}{z-\Phi_{(1)}} {\cal W}^{(1)}_\alpha {\cal W}^{(1)\alpha}X_i\bar{X}_i \right)\\
&g_{(2,i)}(z)\equiv \fr\tr\left(\frac{W^\prime_{(2)}(\Phi_{(2)})-W^\prime_{(2)}(z)}{z-\Phi_{(2)}} {\cal W}^{(2)}_\alpha {\cal W}^{(2)\alpha}\bar{X}_i X_i \right)
\end{split}
\ee

We believe all higher-degree equations will give no new constraints on the resolvents, just as we have showed the cubic doesn't.
We interpret this as saying that the low energy dynamics of the affine quiver $\hat{A}_1$ depends only on one resolvent (the difference of the two original ones) satisfying equation (\ref{quadaffine}), which is the generalized Konishi anomaly equation for a $U(N_1-N_2)$ gauge theory with tree superpotential $W(\Phi)$. This is in accordance with \cite{KS}, where this same theory has been studied from a much different point of view. There it was shown that under an RG flow the theory goes through a Seiberg-duality cascade, going all the way down to a $U(N_1-N_2+p)\times U(p)$ (where $p$ can also be 0). The same conclusion can be reached also from the study of this theory via matrix models, as has been done in \cite{DVdec}.

\setcounter{equation}{0}\section{Affine quivers $\hat{A}_{n-1}$}
{\it Quadratic equation}
\vspace{12pt}

Extending our previous analysis of generalized Konishi anomalies and resolvent equations to general affine quivers requires only little modifications. Let us start from the quadratic equation. We consider the same reparameterizations of the adjoint and bifundamental fields as in (\ref{adj}) and (\ref{bifund}), where this time $k=1,\ldots n$.
The Ward identities we obtain are
\be\label{affquadadj}
W^\prime_{(k)}(z)R_{(k)}(z)+\frac{1}{4}f_{(k)}(z)-\frac{1}{32\pi^2} \tr\bar{X} \k X+\fr\tr X \k\bar{X}  =R_{(k)}(z)^2
\ee
\be\label{affquadbif}
-\fr\tr\bar{X}\k X+\fr\tr X\pk1\bar{X}=R_{(k)}(z)R_{(k+1)}(z)
\ee
where again $f_{(k)}(z)$ is an $(n_k-1)^{th}$ degree polynomial defined as in (\ref{fz})
\be\label{fzaff}
f_{(k)}(z)\equiv -\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\tr\left(  \frac{ W^\prime_{(k)}(\Phi_{(k)})-W^\prime_{(k)}(z)}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}{\cal W}_{\alpha}^{(k)}{\cal W}^{(k)\alpha}\right)
\ee

We want to take a linear combination of these equations in order to eliminate all $X$- and $\bar{X}$-dependent operators. We find there is actually such a combination: we sum (\ref{affquadadj}) over $k=1,\ldots n$ and subtract (\ref{affquadbif}) summed over the same indices. The quadratic equation we obtain is
\be\label{affquad}
\sum_{k=1}^n(R_{(k)}^2(z)-W^\prime_{(k)}(z)R_{(k)}(z)-\frac{1}{4}f_{(k)}(z)-R_{(k)}(z)R_{(k+1)}(z))=0
\ee

Differently from the case of non-affine quivers, we can't write the expectation value of $X$-$\bar{X}$ operators as functions of the resolvents at this stage: the equations we have determined so far will prove not to be enough. In fact we can take the sum of (\ref{affquadadj}) and (\ref{affquadbif}) and find
\be\label{rec}
-\fr\tr\left( X\pk1 \bar{X}- X\k\bar{X}\right)=R_{(k)}^2-W^\prime_{(k)}R_{(k)}-\frac{1}{4}f_{(k)}-R_{(k)}R_{(k+1)}
\ee
Since we have no means to determine the value of any of the $X$-$\bar{X}$ operators, this equation needs a free-parameter to be introduced in order to give a solution. Let us call
\be
A\equiv -\fr\,\tr X\p1\bar{X}
\ee
then
\be\label{XbarX}
-\fr\tr X\pk1\bar{X}=A+\sum_{p=1}^k(R_{(p)}^2-W^\prime_{(p)}R_{(p)}-\frac{1}{4}f_{(p)}-R_{(p)}R_{(p+1)})
\ee

We can check that these identities are consistent with the quadratic equation (\ref{affquad}):
\be
-\fr\tr X\p1\bar{X}=-\fr\tr X\frac{{\cal WW}}{z-\Phi_{(n+1)}}\bar{X}=A
\ee

From (\ref{affquadbif}) we also determine
\be\label{barXX}
-\fr\tr\bar{X}\k X=A+\sum_{p=1}^k(R_{(p)}^2-W^\prime_{(p)}R_{(p)}-\frac{1}{4}f_{(p)}-R_{(p)}R_{(p+1)}) +R_{(k)}R_{(k+1)}
\ee

\vspace{12pt}
{\it Cubic equation}
\vspace{12pt}

To obtain the cubic equation we proceed in a similar manner. Let us consider the same transformations which we used to build the anomaly chain for the cubic equation of $A_n$ theories ($k=1,\ldots n$ this time) 

\begin{subequations}\label{affcubicvar}
\be
\label{affa} \delta\Phi_{(k)}=\k X\bar{X}
\ee\be
\label{affb} \delta\Phi_{(k)}=\k \bar{X}X
\ee\be
\label{affc} \delta X_{k,k+1}=\k X\bar{X}X\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k+1)}}
\ee\be
\label{affd} \delta X_{k,k+1}=\k\bar{X}XX\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k+1)}}
\ee\be
\label{affe} \delta \bar{X}_{k+1,k}=\pk1 \bar{X}\bar{X}X\frac{1}{z-\Phi_{(k)}}
\ee
\end{subequations}
from which we obtain

\begin{subequations}\label{affcubicward}
\be\label{affwa}
\begin{split}
(W^\prime_{(k)}-R_{(k)})\tr\bar{X}&\k X+\frac{1}{4}g_{(1,k)}=\\&=-\tr X\bar{X}\k X\bar{X} +\tr \bar{X}X\k X\bar{X}

R_{(k+1)}\tr\bar{X}\k & X +R_{(k)}\tr X\pk1 \bar{X}=
\\&=\tr X\bar{X}\k X\bar{X} -\tr\bar{X}X\pk1 \bar{X}X
\end{split}\ee
\be\label{affwd}
R_{(k+1)}\tr X\k \bar{X}=-\tr XX\pk1 \bar{X}\bar{X} +\tr X\bar{X}\k \bar{X}X
\ee
\be\label{affwe}
R_{(k+1)}\tr X\k \bar{X}=-\tr XX\pk1 \bar{X}\bar{X} +\tr\bar{X}X\k X\bar{X}
\ee
\end{subequations}
where
\be
\begin{split}
&\frac{1}{4}g_{(1,k)}(z)=\tr\left(\frac{W^\prime_{(k)}(\Phi_{(k)})-W^\prime_{(k)}(z)}{z-\Phi_{(k)}} {\cal W}_{\alpha}^{(k)}{\cal W}^{(k)\alpha}X\bar{X}\right)\\
&\frac{1}{4}g_{(2,k)}(z)=\tr\left(\frac{W^\prime_{(k)}(\Phi_{(k)})-W^\prime_{(k)}(z)}{z-\Phi_{(k)}} {\cal W}_{\alpha}^{(k)}{\cal W}^{(k)\alpha}\bar{X}X\right)
\end{split}
\ee

To build the cubic equation, we consider the chain
\be\label{affcubicchain}
\sum_{p=0}^{n-1}(\delta\Phi^a_{k+p}+\delta X^c_{k+p,k+1+p}+\delta\Phi^a_{k+1+p}+\delta X^d_{k+1+p,k+2+p}-\delta \bar{X}^e_{k+2+p,k+1+p})
\ee
where $k$ is any of the points on the quiver diagram. This chain allows us to take all 4-link operators out of the final Ward identity. The equation we obtain still contains 2-link traces, which we get rid of by using (\ref{XbarX}) and (\ref{barXX}). Finally, also $A$ does not appear because of (\ref{condWaff}). Fixing $k=1$ for simplicity, we obtain
\be
\begin{split}
\sum_{p=1}^n &W^\prime_{(p+1)}(z)\left(\sum_{q=1}^p(R_{(q)}^2(z)-W^\prime_{(q)}(z)R_{(q)}(z)-\frac{1}{4}f_{(q)}(z)-R_{(q)}(z)R_{(q+1)}(z))+\right.\\&\left. - \sum_{q=p+1}^n(R_{(q)}^2(z)-W^\prime_{(q)}(z)R_{(q)}(z)-\frac{1}{4}f_{(q)}(z)-R_{(q)}(z)R_{(q+1)}(z))\right)+\\&+\sum_{p=1}^n W^\prime_{(p)}(z)(R_{(p)}^2(z)-W^\prime_{(p)}(z)R_{(p)}(z)-\frac{1}{4}f_{(p)}(z))-\sum_{p=1}^n R_{(p)}^2(z) R_{(p+1)}(z)+\\&+\sum_{p=1}^n R_{(p-1)}(z) R_{(p)}^2(z)+\sum_{p+1}^n\left(\frac{1}{4}g_{(1,p)}(z)+\frac{1}{4}g_{(2,p)}(z)\right)=0
\end{split}

We have found the quadratic and cubic constraints on the resolvents of affine and non-affine quiver gauge theories. This allowed us to study in detail the two simplest examples $A_2$ and $\hat{A}_1$.

We have also given a procedure that allows to write all higher-order equations. We believe that the highest-degree equation for non-affine $A_n$ theories is of order $n+1$. This would mean that the resolvents are roots of an $(n+1)^{th}$ degree algebraic curve. Since we never worried of minimizing the effective superpotential, our analysis and the algebraic curve obtained from the anomaly equations are valid off-shell. The curve should be strongly related to the Seiberg-Witten curve of the theory \cite{Klemm} \cite{mtheorywitten} that is obtained going on-shell and turning off the tree superpotential to recover ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry. It still remains an open problem to make an on-shell analysis of these theories similar to what has been done for $U(N)$ theories in \cite{CSW2}.

In the affine case, it is not even clear what the algebraic curve should look like. There are some suggestions that it might be much more complicated than a finite order polynomial. Some more questions still wait for an answer in this case. First of all, it would be really interesting to understand how our picture changes when the two gauge factors of $\hat{A}_1$ are identical. Analysis undergone with different methods say that the theory becomes conformal in this case, and we believe this can be implemented in the formalism of this work only after having gone on-shell. Another non-trivial question to be addressed is to study the analog of RG cascades for $n>2$ affine quivers. There are examples of theories which are analogous to these models, for which such cascades exist \cite{cascade} \cite{tatar}.

We will study these open problems in a subsequent paper.
