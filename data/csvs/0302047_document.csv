\noindent
We consider warp compactifications of M-theory on 7-manifolds in the
presence of \mbox{4-form} fluxes and investigate the constraints imposed by
supersymmetry. As long as the \mbox{7-manifold} supports only one Killing
spinor we infer from the Killing spinor equations that non-trivial
4-form fluxes will necessarily curve the external 4-dimensional space.
On the other hand, if the 7-manifold has at least two Killing spinors,
there is a non-trivial Killing vector yielding a reduction of the
7-manifold to a 6-manifold and we confirm that 4-form fluxes can be
incorporated if one includes non-trivial $SU(3)$ structures.

\section{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

One way to describe phenomenological interesting models in 4
dimensions with ${\cal N}$=1 supersymmetry is to consider M-theory on
a 7-manifold with $G_2$ holonomy. In this case the 4-form field is
trivial, but one may ask whether one can turn on a non-trivial 4-form
flux in the internal space while still keeping the flat 4-d Minkowski
space with four unbroken supercharges. Over the past years this
question has been explored in different directions with more or less
restrictive assumptions. In a number of papers the existence of
non-trivial fluxes is excluded, see e.g.\ \cite{120, 410, 400, 190,
260}, or a non-trivial superpotential appears, see e.g.\ \cite{390,
420}. On the other hand, in the literature one can find examples of
M-theory compactifications in the presence of fluxes \cite{280, 220,
200, 210} as well as examples of 10-d string theory with fluxes that
yield a flat 4-dimensional vacuum \cite{360, 480, 140, 430}.  The
essential ingredient of these string theory compactifications are
non-trivial $SU(3)$ structures (i.e.\ torsion) as well as a warped
geometry, see also \cite{320,150}.  Moreover, it is well-known that
one can compactify M-theory in presence of 4-form fluxes to a $D$=4,
{$\cal N$}=1 anti de Sitter vacuum \cite{270}, i.e.\ the corresponding
superpotential has a non-vanishing extremum.  Similar to the string
theory compactifications, this solution involves non-trivial $G$
structures, where the torsion 3-form, that parallelizes the 7-manifold
(deformed $\S^7$), is the dual of the 4-form on the 7-manifold
\cite{300}.

In this note we attempt to clarify different aspects. We will
especially relax the assumption, made in a number of papers, that the
11-dimensional spinor is a direct product of the 4-spinor and
7-spinor, see also \cite{270, 260}. With this in mind, we can
summarize our assumptions as follows. We are looking for M-theory
configurations that allow upon (warp) compactifications a flat
Minkowski space with four unbroken supercharges.  In order to keep
Lorentz symmetry, we assume that all Kaluza-Klein vector fields are
trivial yielding a block-diagonal form of the metric and allowing only
for internal components of the 4-form field. Our ansatz for the 11-d
metric and 4-form field strength reads therefore
