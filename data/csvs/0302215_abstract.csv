It is argued that the phenomenon of a flux tube in quantum chromodynamics 
is closely connected with a spontaneously symmetry breakdown of gauge theory. 
It is shown that in the presence of a mass term in the SU(2) gauge theory 
the Nielsen-Olesen equations describe the flux tube surrounded by an external 
field.
