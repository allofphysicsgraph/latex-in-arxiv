We systematically analyse the necessary and sufficient conditions for
the preservation of supersymmetry for bosonic geometries of the 
form $\mathbb{R}^{1,9-d}\times M_d$, in the common NS-NS sector of 
type II string theory and also type I/heterotic string theory. 
The results are phrased in terms of the intrinsic torsion of $G$-structures
and provide a comprehensive classification of static supersymmetric
backgrounds in these theories. 
Generalised calibrations naturally appear since the 
geometries always admit NS or type I/heterotic 
fivebranes wrapping calibrated cycles.
Some new solutions are presented. In particular we
find $d=6$ examples with a fibred structure which preserve ${\cal N}=1,2,3$
supersymmetry in type II and include compact type~I/heterotic geometries.
