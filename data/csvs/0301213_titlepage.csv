{\bf Abstract}

\end{center}

We discuss the Burgers equation and the exact solutions
on $(1+1)$-dimensional noncommutative spaces.
We obtain the noncommutative version of the Burgers equation
which possesses the Lax representation
by the Lax-pair generating technique
and succeed in the linearization of it
by noncommutative version of the Cole-Hopf transformations.
We find the simple solutions of the linearized equation exactly
and discuss more general solutions by the Weyl transformation.
We also present the noncommutative Burgers hierarchy.
%which contains integrable evolution equations.
