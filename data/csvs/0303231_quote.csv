\\[3mm]
We realize the CFT with target a lens space $SU(2)/\ints_{l}$ as a simple current construction. This 
allows us to compute the boundary states and the annuli coefficients, and in particular 
to study the B-type branes, in purely algebraic terms. 
Several issues, like the appearance of fractional branes and symmetry breaking boundary 
conditions, can be addressed more directly
in this approach than in a more geometric treatment.
