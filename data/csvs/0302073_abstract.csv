Kaigorodov spaces arise, after spherical compactification, as near horizon limits of M2, M5, and D3-branes with a particular pp-wave propagating in a world volume
direction. We show that the
uncompactified near horizon configurations $K\times S$ are solutions
of $D=11$ or $D=10$ IIB supergravity which correspond to
perturbed versions of their $AdS \times S$ analogues. We derive the
Penrose-G\""uven limits of the Kaigorodov space and the total spaces
and analyse their symmetries. An In\""on\""u-Wigner contraction of the Lie algebra is shown to
occur, although there is a symmetry enhancement. We compare the results to the maximally supersymmetric CW spaces found as
limits of $AdS\times S$ spacetimes: the initial gravitational perturbation on the
brane and its near horizon geometry remains after taking
non-trivial Penrose limits, but seems to decouple. One particuliar
limit  yields a time-dependent
homogeneous plane-wave background whose string theory is solvable,
while in the other cases we find inhomogeneous backgrounds.
