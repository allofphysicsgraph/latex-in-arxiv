  Using the Nahm transform we investigate doubly periodic charge one
  $SU(2)$ instantons with radial symmetry. Two special points where
  the Nahm zero modes have softer singularities are identified as the
  locations of instanton core constituents. For a square torus this
  constituent picture is closely reflected in the action density.  In
  rectangular tori with large aspect ratios the cores merge to form
  monopole-like objects. For particular values of the parameters the
  torus can be cut in half yielding two copies of a twisted charge
  ${1\over2}$ instanton.  These findings are illustrated with plots of
  the action density within a two-dimensional slice containing the
  constituents.
