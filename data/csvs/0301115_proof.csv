0,"\begin{proof} It is sufficient to establish the statement 
for closed double cones ${B}$ of the form
${B} = \{(\kappa,{\bf 0}) + \overline{V}_{\! +}\}
\cap\{(\kappa^{-1},{\bf 0}) -  \overline{V}_{\! +}\}$
for $0 < \kappa <1$. These regions are stable under the involution
$\iota(\beta) \doteq \beta / \beta^2$, $\beta \in V_+$. As is
well known, this transformation induces an involution on the 
smooth solutions of the wave equation on $V_+$, given by 
$I(\Xi)(\beta) \doteq \iota(\beta)^2 \, \Xi (\iota(\beta))$.
It is continuous relative to the seminorms  (\ref{seminorm}),
$$
\| I(\Xi) \|_{B} \leq \kappa^{-2} \, \| \Xi \|_{B},
\quad \
\| \partial^\nu I(\Xi) \|_{B} \leq
2 \kappa^{-3} \, \| \Xi \|_{B} + 3  \kappa^{-4}
\sum_{\nu^\prime} \, \| \partial^{\nu^\prime} \Xi \|_{B}.
$$
(Similar bounds can be established also for higher
derivatives by elementary computations.) Since
$I$ is an involution, $\Xi$ and $I(\Xi)$ may be interchanged
in these inequalities. 

For the proof of the first half of the statement 
it is convenient to proceed, in a first step, to the functions  
$l_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \Theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}$, 
where $l_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} = l_{\mu_1} \dots l_{\mu_m}$, $l$  
being any positive lightlike vector, and, in a second step, 
to their images $I(l_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}  \Theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}})$
under the involution $I$. 
According to the preceding 
remarks it suffices to show that the linear span of 
the latter functions is dense in the space of all 
smooth solutions of the wave equation with regard to 
the seminorms $\|  \cdot  \|_{B}$.  
The functions $I(l_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \, \Theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}})$,
resulting from (\ref{parameters}), have the simple form
$$\beta \mapsto I(l_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}  \Theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}) (\beta) = 
c^\prime_m \, (l\beta)^m,$$
where $c^\prime_m \neq 0$ if $m$ is 
even and $c^\prime_m = 0$ if  $m$ is odd. So we have
to show that suitable linear combinations of the functions 
$\beta \mapsto  (l\beta)^m$ for even $m$ and
lightlike $l$ approximate any given smooth solution of 
the wave equation, uniformly on compact sets ${B} \subset V_+$.

We make use of the fact  
that the functions $z \mapsto e^{\, \pm \, i \sqrt{z}}$ are analytic in
the complex half--plane 
$\mathbb C_+ \doteq \{z \in \mathbb C : \mbox{Re} \, z > 0 \}$. Thus they can 
be represented on any compact subset $C \subset \mathbb C_+$
by a uniformly convergent power series in $z$, whence 
$z \mapsto e^{\, \pm \, i z} =  e^{\, \pm \, i \sqrt{z^2}}$
can be represented by a uniformly convergent power series
in $z^2 \in C$.
As $\kappa |{\mbox{\boldmath $l$}}| \leq l\beta \leq 2 \kappa^{-1} |{\mbox{\boldmath $l$}}|$
for $\beta \in {B}$ and $l = (|{\mbox{\boldmath $l$}}|, {\mbox{\boldmath $l$}})$, 
we see that the functions
$\beta \mapsto  e^{\, \pm \, i \,  l\beta} $
can be represented by uniformly convergent power series 
involving only even powers $ (l\beta)^m$, $\beta \in {B}$. 
Moreover, the functions
$$ \beta \mapsto \sum_{\pm} \int \! d^{\,3}{{\mbox{\boldmath $l$}}} \, f_\pm ({\mbox{\boldmath $l$}}) \,  
e^{\, \pm \, i \,  l\beta}, $$
where $f_\pm$ are absolutely 
integrable, can be approximated by linear combinations 
of $\beta \mapsto  e^{\, \pm \, i \,  l\beta} $,
uniformly on compact sets ${B}$. So we conclude that linear 
combinations of $\beta \mapsto  (l\beta)^m$ for even $m$
and suitable $l$ approximate these functions as well.

It remains to show that the restriction of any smooth 
solution $\Xi$ of the wave equation to the double cone ${B}$
admits an integral representation as given above.
This can be seen if one extends the smooth Cauchy data
of $\Xi$ on the base of ${B}$
to test functions with compact support in a slightly larger
region. Using
these data as initial values, one obtains a smooth
solution $\Xi_{B}$ of the wave equation which coincides
with $\Xi$ on ${B}$ according to standard uniqueness results.  
In view of the regularity properties of its Cauchy
data, $\Xi_{B}$ admits an integral representation
as given above. In fact, the corresponding
functions $f_\pm$ are, apart from an integrable 
singularity at the origin, smooth and rapidly decreasing.
This completes the proof of the first part of the 
statement.

The proof of the second part proceeds along similar lines
and we therefore indicate only the essential steps. We 
begin by noting that 
$$ \beta \mapsto l_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}  \Theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}} (\beta) = 
 \partial^{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} \, c^\prime_{m+1} \, (l\beta)^m (\beta^2){}^{-m-1},
$$
where $c^\prime_{m+1} \neq 0$ if $m$ is odd. Applying the 
involution $I$ to 
$\beta \mapsto  (l\beta)^m (\beta^2){}^{-m-1}$, 
we see that it suffices to show that suitable linear combinations of 
the functions $\beta \mapsto  (l\beta)^m$ for odd $m$ and
lightlike $l$ approximate any given smooth solution of 
the wave equation, uniformly on compact sets ${B} \subset V_+$,
and that the same holds true for their respective partial derivatives.

We now use the fact that the functions
$z \mapsto  ({\scriptstyle 1/\sqrt{z}}) \, e^{\, \pm \, i \sqrt{z}}$
are analytic on $\mathbb C_+$. Hence 
$z \mapsto e^{\, \pm \, i z} = ({\scriptstyle z / \sqrt{z^2}}) 
\, e^{\, \pm \, i \sqrt{z^2}}$ 
can be represented, on the domains specified above, by uniformly convergent 
power series involving only odd powers of $z$. So the functions
$\beta \mapsto  e^{\, \pm \, i \,  l\beta} $
can likewise be represented by uniformly convergent power series 
involving only odd powers $ (l\beta)^m$, $\beta \in {B}$. 
In view of the analyticity of these functions, this uniformity of
convergence holds also for their respective partial derivatives.

Now if the functions $f_\pm$ in the above integral representation
of solutions of the wave equation 
are sufficiently rapidly decreasing, these integrals can not
only be approximated by suitable linear combinations of the 
functions $\beta \mapsto  e^{\, \pm \, i \,  l\beta} $, uniformly
on ${B}$, but the same holds true also for their respective 
partial derivatives. Yet, as has been explained, the
restrictions of smooth solutions of the wave equation to 
$B$ can be represented in this desired way, so the proof of the 
statement is complete. \"
1,"\begin{proof} For the proof of the first equation we proceed from 
relation (\ref{4.3}) which implies for any choice of constants
$c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}$
$$  \partial{}_{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}} \, \omega\big({\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} 
\, \theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(x)\big) = 0.
$$
As $\omega$ is ${\cal S}_{\cal O}$--thermal, we also have 
for $x \in {\cal O}$
$$
\omega\big({\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \, \Theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}\big)(x) =
\omega\big({\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \, \theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(x)\big),
$$
and combining these two equations we arrive at 
$$  \partial{}_{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}} \, \omega\big({\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} 
\, \Theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}\big)(x) = 0.
$$
The first part of the statement now follows from the continuity
property (\ref{lift}) of local equilibrium states and Lemma \ref{lemma3.1}.

For the second equality we make use 
of relation (\ref{4.4}) which implies
$$
\beta \mapsto 
\Theta_{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(\beta) = 
\omega_\beta(\theta_{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(x))
= - \, \omega_\beta(\square  \, \theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(x))
= - \, \square  \, \omega_\beta(\theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(x)) = 0,
$$
where the latter equality follows from the invariance of the 
KMS states under space--time translations. Hence 
$\Theta_{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}} = 0$, so taking into account once more that
$\omega$ is ${\cal S}_{\cal O}$--thermal we obtain
\begin{gather*}
\square  \, \omega\big(\, {\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \Theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}\big)(x)
= \square  \, \omega\big(\, {\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(x)\big)
= \omega(\, {\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \, \square  \, \theta^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(x)) \\
 = - \, \omega\big(\, {\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \theta_{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}(x)\big)
= - \, \omega\big(\, {\sum} c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} \Theta_{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}}\big)(x) = 0. 
\end{gather*}
As before, the second assertion then follows from the continuity properties
of $\omega$ and Lemma \ref{lemma3.1}.
\"
2,"\begin{proof} Consider the function $L_p$ on $V_+$,
$$
\beta \mapsto L_p(\beta) \doteq (2\pi)^{-3} \, \ln \, (1 -e^{\, - \beta p}).
$$
It is a smooth solution of the wave equation and consequently
$L_p$ is an admissible macro--observable. Now
$$
\partial^{\, {\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}} L_p(\beta) = p^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}} \, 
 (2\pi)^{-3} \, \frac{1}{e^{\, \beta p} - 1}
=  p^{{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}}} N_p(\beta).
$$
Applying the preceding lemma, we conclude that
$$
(p \, \partial) \, \omega(N_p) (x) =
\partial_{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} \, \omega(p^{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} N_p) (x)
= \partial_{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} \, \omega(\partial^{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} L_p) (x) = 0,
$$
as claimed. The second part of the statement follows
directly from the lemma.~\"
3,"\begin{proof} Statement (a) follows
from Lemma  (\ref{lemma4.1}) and the relation
$p^{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} E_p = -i \, \partial^{\mbox{\footnotesize $\nu$}} E_p$. For the proof of (b)
we make use of the fact that
$\omega_f(\,\cdot\,)(x)$ is a state on  $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}_p$,
hence $|\, \omega_f(E_p)(x) \,|^2 \leq 
\omega_f(E_p{}^* E_p)(x) = 1$, $x \in {\cal O}$. 
In order to establish the existence of the extension 
in (c), we first extend the operators $E_p$ 
to admissible operators $E_k$, $k \in \mathbb C^4$. Their respective
thermal functions are given in proper coordinates by 
$$
\beta \mapsto 
E_k(\beta) \doteq \big(\cos(\beta_0|{\mbox{\boldmath $k$}}|) + ik_0 \, |{\mbox{\boldmath $k$}}|^{-1}
\sin(\beta_0|{\mbox{\boldmath $k$}}|) \big) \, e^{\, -i {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $k$}} {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\beta$}}}.
$$
These functions are entire analytic in $k$ and 
locally uniformly bounded if $\beta$ varies in compact sets
${B} \subset V_+$. It thus follows from 
the continuity properties subsumed in (\ref{5.1})
that $ k \mapsto \omega_f(E_k) (x)$ provides the desired extension.
The remaining statement (d) is a straightforward consequence of 
H\""older's inequality, taking into account that the 
operators $M_p^{\, n}$, $n \in \mathbb N_0$, are positive elements of
$\boldsymbol{\Gamma}_p$ (being represented by positive 
functions on $V_+$). \"
4,"\begin{proof} 
As explained above, we proceed from $\omega$ to the   
regularized states $\omega_f$.
Any one of the latter states is  ${\cal S}_{\cal O}$--thermal in the 
region ${\cal O} = \bigcap_{\, x \, \in \, \mbox{\footnotesize supp} \, f} 
\{ {\cal O}_\omega + x \}$, which likewise is convex and contains some
lightcone, say $V_+$ for concreteness.
Because of the convexity
of ${\cal O}$, $V_+ + y \subset {\cal O}$ for $y \in {\cal O}$. 
We consider now the functions, $p$ being an arbitrary 
positive lightlike vector, 
$$
x \mapsto \overline{E}_p(x) \doteq \omega_f (E_p)(x), \quad x \in {\cal O}.
$$
Introducing the coordinates $x_\pm = x_0 \, \pm \, {\mbox{\boldmath $e$}} {\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}$ 
and ${\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}_\bot = {\mbox{\boldmath $x$}} - ({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}} {\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}) {\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}$, where ${\mbox{\boldmath $e$}} = {\mbox{\boldmath $p$}}/|{\mbox{\boldmath $p$}}|$,
it follows from part (a) of the preceding lemma that $\overline{E}_p$
does not depend on $x_+$ and satisfies $\triangle_\bot \overline{E} _p(x) = 0$,
$x \in {\cal O}$, where $\triangle_\bot$ is the Laplacian with
respect to ${\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}_\bot$. 

Now, given $x_- \in \{y_-: y \in {\cal O} \}$ and any 
${\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}_\bot \in \mathbb R^2$, there exists an $x \in {\cal O}$ with these 
components. For if $y \in {\cal O}$, the point $x$ with the 
components $x_- = y_-$, $x_+ = y_+ + t$, ${\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}_\bot$ is,
for sufficiently large $t$, contained
in the lightcone $z + V_+ \subset {\cal O}$, provided  
$z \in {\cal O}$ and $(y -z)$ is positive timelike.
So for fixed $x_- \in \{y_-: y \in {\cal O} \}$ one has  
$\triangle_\bot \overline{E} _p(x) = 0$, ${\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}_\bot \in \mathbb R^2$.
But according to parts (b) and (c) of the preceding lemma,
$x \mapsto  \overline{E}_p(x)$ is smooth and bounded
in modulus by $1$, hence it cannot depend on
${\mbox{\boldmath $x$}}_\bot$ in view of the growth properties of 
non--trivial solutions of 
the Laplace equation (Harnack's inequality).

Because of the analyticity properties of $\overline{E}_p$
established in part (c) of the lemma, we can represent
this function as power series,
$ \overline{E}_p(x) = 
\sum_{m = 0}^{\infty} \, |{\mbox{\boldmath $p$}}|^m \, c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}(x) \, e^{{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}},
$
where $e = (1,{\mbox{\boldmath $e$}})$ and all coefficients $c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}(x)$ are smooth in $x$. 
Moreover, in view of the results obtained in the 
preceding step, $x \mapsto c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}(x) e^{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}$  
can depend only on $x_- = ex$ in a 
\mbox{non--trivial} manner. Thus, by 
$k$--fold partial differentiation with respect to $x$ and an
application of the chain rule, we obtain
$$   
(y \, \partial)^{k} \, c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}(x)  e^{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} =
(ye)^{k} \, \partial_0^{\,k} \, c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}(x) e^{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}},
\quad     x \in {\cal O}, \, y \in \mathbb R^4.
$$
Expressing the products of the components of ${\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}$
in terms of spherical harmonics, it is apparent that, for $k > m$,
this equality can only be satisfied if 
$\partial_0^{\,k} \, c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}(x)  e^{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}} = 0$.
So each function 
$x \mapsto c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}(x) e^{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}$
is a polynomial in $ex$ of degree $m$ or less
with coefficients which are polynomials in the components of ${\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}$.

Making use of the fact that 
$\overline{E}_p(x) = \sum_{m = 0}^{\infty} \, 
\frac{|{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $p$}}|^m \, i^m}{m!} \, \omega_f(M_e^{\,m})(x),
$
where $M_e^{\, m}$ are the operators 
introduced in (\ref{obsdef}), we therefore find that each function
$$
x \mapsto {\omega_f(M_e^{\,m})(x)} = 
(-i)^m m! \ c_{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}}(x) \, e^{\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $\mu$}},
\quad     x \in {\cal O},
$$
is a polynomial in $ex$ of degree 
$m$ or less. According to part (d) of the preceding 
lemma these polynomials are non--negative.
Moreover, there is some $m$ such that the 
corresponding polynomial is of first degree in $ex$, 
unless $x \mapsto {\omega_f(M_e^{\,m})(x)}$
is constant for all $m \in \mathbb N$. To verify this, 
let $x \mapsto {\omega_f(M_e^{\,k})(x)}$
be constant for $k = 0, \dots m-1$. It then follows from
(d) and the fact that the polynomial degree of 
$x \mapsto {\omega_f(M_e^{\,2m - 1})(x)}$ is 
at most $2m -1$ that 
$x \mapsto {\omega_f(M_e^{\,m})(x)}$ increases
no faster than $|x|^{(2m-1)/m}$ for large 
$x \in V_+  \subset {\cal O}$. Hence 
$x \mapsto {\omega_f(M_e^{\,m})(x)}$, being a  polynomial, 
has to be of first degree in $ex$ if it is not constant.

If the second alternative in the statement holds, {\it i.e.\ } if
$x \mapsto \omega_f(\Xi)(x)$ depends non--trivially on $x$ for 
some $\Xi$, there is also some $M_e^{\,m}$ for which this
is true since the linear span of the latter operators is dense in the
space of admissible macro--observables, {\it cf.\ } the proof of 
Lemma \ref{lemma3.1}. Thus, because of the preceding 
results, we may assume that 
$$
\omega_f(M_e^{\,m})(x) = P_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) \, (ex) + Q_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}), \quad x \in {\cal O},
$$
where $P_f$, $Q_f$ are polynomials and $P_f$ is not identically zero.
But $\omega_f(M_e^{\,m})(x) \geq 0$, $\quad x \in {\cal O}$, so 
$$
P_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) \, (ex) + Q_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) \geq 0, \quad x \in {\cal O}.
$$
Since $V_+ \subset {\cal O}$ and $P_f \neq 0$
it follows that
$P_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) > 0$ for almost all ${\mbox{\boldmath $e$}} $ and $Q_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) \geq 0$. Hence   
${\cal O} \subset \bigcap_{\, {\mbox{\footnotesize \boldmath $e$}}} \, 
\{ x : ex \geq - Q_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}})/P_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) \}$.
In particular, ${\cal O}$ is contained in some positive timelike simplicial 
cone consisting of the intersection of four characteristic half--spaces.
The same is therefore true for ${\cal O}_\omega$ since the support 
of $f$ is compact.

We mention as an aside that, due to the linearity of $\omega_f$ in $f$ and 
$\omega_f \circ \alpha_y = \omega_{f_{-y}}$, one has 
$ P_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) = \int \! dy \, f(y) \, P({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}})$ 
and 
$ Q_f({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) = \int \! dy \, f(y) \, \big((ey) P({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}}) + Q({\mbox{\boldmath $e$}})\big)$
for certain polynomials $P$, $Q$ which do not depend on $f$.

The statement has thus been established for regions ${\cal O}_\omega$
containing $V_+$. But the arguments can be carried over to arbitrary
regions containing some shifted forward or backward lightcone, so the proof
of the proposition is complete. \"
