  Numerical methods have allowed the construction of vacuum
  non-uniform strings. For sufficient non-uniformity, the local
  geometry about the minimal horizon sphere (the ``waist'') was
  conjectured to be a cone metric.  We are able to test this
  conjecture explicitly giving strong evidence in favour of it.
  We also show how to extend the conjecture to weakly charged strings.
