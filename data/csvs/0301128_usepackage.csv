{\bf Abstract} 

\noindent
The paradigmatic Unruh radiation is an ideal and simple case of stationary vacuum radiation patterns related to worldlines defined
as Frenet-Serret curves. We review the corresponding body of literature as well as the experimental proposals that have been suggested
to detect these types of quantum field radiation patterns. Finally, we comment on a few other topics related to the Unruh effect.\\}

%{\bf FORWARD}

%\subsection{\bf 150 years ago}
\noindent
J.F. Frenet (1816-1900) wrote a doctoral thesis in 1847. Part of it deals with the theory of space curves and contains six formulas of the nine three-dimensional
Frenet-Serret formulas. He published his results in {\em Journal de mathematiques pures et appliques} in 1852. J.A. Serret (1819-1885) gave the set of all nine
formulas in three dimensions.

\bigskip
\noindent
The standard FS formulas are the following
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{eqnarray*} 
\dot{\vec{T}} & = &\kappa \cdot \vec{N}\\
\dot{\vec{N}} & = &\tau \cdot \vec{B}-\kappa \cdot \vec{T}\\
\dot{\vec{B}} & = &-\tau \cdot \vec{N}~.\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent
These three formulas give the derivatives of the unit tangent, normal, and binormal vectors, respectively, as vectorial combinations of the moving basis in which the two Frenet-Serret invariants
of the normal three-dimensional space, curvature and torsion, respectively, enter as scalar coefficients.
They can be written in matrix form as well
%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation*} \label{matrix}
\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
\dot{\vec{T}}\\
\dot{\vec{N}}\\
\dot{\vec{B}}
\end{array} \right )
=
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 0 & \kappa & 0 \\
-\kappa & 0 & \tau\\
0 & -\tau & 0\end{array} \right )\left( \begin{array}{ccc}
\vec{T}\\
\vec{N}\\
\vec{B}
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation*}

\bigskip
\noindent
The plane formed by the span of $\vec{T}$ and $\vec{N}$ is called the osculating plane. The span of $\vec{N}$ and $\vec{B}$ is the normal plane and 
the span of $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{T}$ is the transverse plane to the curve at the point where the Frenet-Serret triad is considered.

\bigskip
\noindent
For the goals of the first part of this review, the interested reader may consult several papers of more recent times. These are seminal papers that
apply the Frenet-Serret formalism to relativistic world lines and quantum field theory. 
First, as quoted by J.L. Synge, Jasper \cite{jas47} studied in 1947 helices in flat space of $n$ dimensions, but only for a positive-definite metric.
Next, Synge wrote an important paper on timelike helices in flat space-time and classified them in six types according to the relative magnitudes of 
the three Frenet-Serret invariants \cite{syng67}. He also proved for the first time that the world line of a charged particle moving in a constant electromagnetic field
is a helix. A few years later, in the seminal paper of Honig, Schucking and Vishveshwara \cite{hsv74} a connection was established between the Lorentz
invariants of the elctromagnetic field and the Frenet-Serret invariants. The 1981 Letaw's paper \cite{l81} is in fact the first work in which  the FS invariants 
and quantum field concepts are merged together (see below). Interesting generalizations to more dimensions, black hole environments, and gyroscopic 
precession have been investigated by Iyer and Vishveshwara \cite{iv} (see also \cite{bjm}).

\bigskip
\noindent
We also notice that at  the strictly classical level, the Frenet-Serret coordinate system is quite used in accelerator physics to express
Hamiltonians and/or fields \cite{chao}.

\subsection{\bf  Stationary world lines and the vacuum excitation of noninertial detectors}

\bigskip

\noindent
%{\bf abs} -
In 1981, Letaw studied the  
stationary world lines, on which quantized field detectors in a scalar vacuum have time-independent excitation
spectra. They are characterized by the requirement that the geodetic interval between two points depends only
on the proper time interval. He used a generalization of the Frenet equations to Minkowski space and found, not surprisingly, that the
curvature invariants are the proper acceleration and angular velocity of the world line. Solving the generalized Frenet equations for the simple case of
constant invariants leads to  several classes of stationary world lines. Letaw gave a classification into six types reviewed here. He also demonstrated the
equivalence of the timelike Killing vector field orbits and the stationary world lines. 
%The classification scheme therefore extends to Killing orbits and stationary coordinate systems in flat spacetime. 
Last but not least, Letaw did some calculations of the vacuum excitation spectra of detectors on the sample of six families of stationary world lines.
Letaw's work is a generalization of Unruh's famous result concerning the excitation of a scalar-particle detector moving with constant linear acceleration in the vacuum of flat spacetime. 
According to Unruh, the detector behaves as if in contact with a bath of scalar particles with energies in a Planck spectrum of temperature: acceleration/2$\pi$. 
Because of the connection with the Hawking radiation and its paradigmatic nature, the Unruh effect attracted the attention of many theoretical physicists.
On the other hand, the present author considers that Letaw's results place the Unruh effect in a different and more general perspective that is elaborated herein.
We hope that a more effective attitude is put forward in the present review that could be more rewarding in the years to come and may help to strengthen the links
between laboratory physics and astrophysics.  




%Similar results have been described for 
%detectors of electromagnetic radiation (Boyer, 1980). Recently (Letaw and Pfautsch, 1980), it has been shown that a detector in uniform circular motion will also be 
%excited. The spectrum differs from a Planck spectrum in a manner dependent on the detector's angular velocity. It is noteworthy that the spectrum is time independent in all
%these cases; in general, this will not be true. For example, if a detector was moving with a very slowly increasing linear acceleration one would expect the spectrum to be %Planckian, though with a slowly increasing temperature.

\bigskip
\noindent
According to DeWitt, 
the probability for a detector moving along a world line $x^{\mu}(\tau)$ to be found in an excited state of energy $E$ at $\tau=\tau _0$ is given in terms 
of the autocorrelation function of the field (Wightman function) %(B.S. DeWitt, 1979) 
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{l81-01}
P(E)=D(E)\int _{-\infty}^{\tau _0}d\tau \int _{-\infty}^{\tau _0}d\tau ^{'}e^{-iE(\tau -\tau ^{'})}\,\langle 0|\phi(x(\tau))\phi(x(\tau ^{'}))|0\rangle~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $D(E)$ is a function characterizing the sensitivity of the detector. The Wightman function for a scalar field is proportional to the inverse of the geodetic 
interval $\Delta (\tau , \tau ^{'})$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-02}
 \langle 0|\phi(x(\tau))\phi(x(\tau ^{'}))|0\rangle =%\frac{1}{2\pi ^2}
%\frac{1}{2\pi ^2[x_{\mu}(\tau)-x_{\mu}(\tau ^{'})][x^{\mu}(\tau)-x^{\mu}(\tau ^{'})]}=
[2\pi ^2\Delta (\tau , \tau ^{'})]^{-1}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where 
\begin{equation}\label{l81-01b}
\Delta (\tau , \tau ^{'})=[x_{\mu}(\tau)-x_{\mu}(\tau ^{'})][x^{\mu}(\tau)-x^{\mu}(\tau ^{'})]~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%
The rate of excitation to the state with energy $E$ is the Fourier cosine transform
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{l81-03}
\frac{dP(E)}{d\tau _0}=2D(E)\int _{-\infty}^{0}ds\langle 0|\phi(x(\tau _0))\phi(x(\tau _0+s))|0\rangle\cos(Es)~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where $s=\tau -\tau ^{'}$ is the proper time interval. The rate of excitation (the response) is directly related to the energy spectrum of the detected scalar
``particles""
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-04}
S(E, \tau)=2\pi \rho (E) \int _{-\infty}^{0}ds\langle 0|\phi(x(\tau))\phi(x(\tau +s))|0\rangle\cos(Es)~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If the Wightman function is time independent the detected spectra are stationary. This is equivalent to the following property of the geodetic interval
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{l81-05}
\Delta (\tau, \tau +s)=\Delta (0,s)~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

{\em Curvature invariants and the Frenet equations}

\bigskip
\noindent
An arbitrary timelike world line in flat space is generally described by four functions, $x^{\mu}(s)$,
specifying the coordinates of each point $s$ on the curve. This parameter may be taken to be the arc length or proper time on the world line.
The parametric representation is unsatisfactory in two respects: 

\bigskip

\noindent
(1) {\em A world line is a geometric object and should not require a coordinate-dependent entity for its definition}.

\bigskip
\noindent
(2) {\em There is an inherent redundancy in the parametric representation since three functions suffice to determine the world line}.

\bigskip

\noindent
The Frenet-Serret (curvature) invariants, on the other hand, provide an intrinsic definition of the world line not subject to these criticisms.

\bigskip
\noindent
The starting point is the construction of an orthonormal tetrad $V_{a}^{\mu}(s)$ at every point on the world line $x^{\mu}(s)$. The Latin index everywhere is a tetrad
index. The tetrad is formed from the derivatives of $x^{\mu}(s)$ with respect to proper time (represented by one or more dots). It is assumed that the 
first four derivatives are linearly independent, the results being practically unchanged when they are not. Members of the tetrad must satisfy the 
orthonormality condition
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-1}
V_{a\mu}V_{b}^{\mu}=\eta _{ab}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
where the metric has diagonal components (1,-1,-1,-1) only.

By Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the derivatives working upwords from the first, the following expressions for the tetrad are found:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-2}
V_{0}^{\mu}=\dot x^{\mu}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-3}
V_{1}^{\mu}=\frac{{\ddot x}^{\alpha}}{(-\ddot x_{\alpha}\ddot x^{\alpha})^{1/2}}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-4}
V_{2}^{\mu}=\frac{(\ddot x_{\gamma}\ddot x^{\gamma})\stackrel{...}x^{\mu}- (\ddot x_{\gamma}\stackrel{...}x^{\gamma})\ddot x^{\mu} +(\ddot x_{\gamma}\ddot x^{\gamma})^2\dot x ^{\mu}}
{[(\ddot x_{\alpha}\ddot x^{\alpha})^4+(\ddot x_{\alpha}\ddot x^{\alpha})(\ddot x_{\beta}\stackrel{...}x^{\beta})^2-
(\ddot x_{\alpha}\ddot x^{\alpha})^2(\stackrel{...}x^{\beta}\stackrel{...}x^{\beta})]^{1/2}}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-5}
V_{3}^{\mu}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\epsilon ^{\alpha \beta \gamma \mu}V_{0\alpha}V_{1\beta}V_{2\gamma}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Overall signs on these vectors are fixed by the orientation of the tetrad.

The tetrad $V_{\sigma}^{\mu}$ is a basis for the vector space at a point on the world line. Derivatives of the basis vectors may therefore be expanded in terms of 
them:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-6}
\dot V _{a}^{\mu}=K_{a}^{b}V_{b}^{\mu}~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
These are the generalized Frenet equations. $K_{ab}$ is a coordinate-independent matrix whose structure must be determined.

Differentiation of the orthonormality condition (\ref{l81-1}) yields
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-7}
\dot V_{a\mu}V_{b}^{\mu}+V_{a\mu}\dot V_{b}^{\mu}=0~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
and, in view of (\ref{l81-6}),
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-8}
K_{ab}=-K_{ba}~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A basis vector $V_{a}^{\mu}$ is defined in terms of the first $a+1$ derivatives of $x^{\mu}$; therefore, $\dot V_{a}^{\mu}$ will be 
a linear combination of the first $a+2$ derivatives. These $a+2$ derivatives are dependent only on the basis vectors $V_{b}^{\mu}$
where $b\leq a+1$. This and (\ref{l81-8}) limit the matrix to the form
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{l81-9}
K_{ab}=
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
 0 & -\kappa (s)& 0 & 0\\
\kappa (s)& 0 & -\tau _1 (s)& 0\\
0 & \tau _1 & 0 & -\tau _2\\
0 & 0 & \tau _ 2 & 0 \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
The three functions of proper time are the invariants
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-10}
\kappa=V_{0\mu}\dot V_{1}^{\mu}=-\dot V_{0\mu}V_{1}^{\mu}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-11}
\tau _1=V_{1\mu}\dot V_{2}^{\mu}=-\dot V_{1\mu}V_{2}^{\mu}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-12}
\tau _2=V_{2\mu}\dot V_{3}^{\mu}=-\dot V_{2\mu}V_{3}^{\mu}~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
They are, respectively, the curvature, the first torsion, and the second torsion (hypertorsion) of the world line. Sign choices are made for reasons brought out 
below.

To explore the physical significance of the invariants we examine the infinitesimal Lorentz transformations of the tetrad at a point on the world line. The transformations leave 
the metric invariant
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-13}
\eta _{ab}=L_{a}^{c}L_{b}^{d}\eta _{cd}~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An infinitesimal transformations may be written 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-14}
L_{a}^{c}=\delta _{a}^{c}+d\epsilon _{a}^{c}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where the elements of $d\epsilon _{a}^{c}$ are small and must satisfy
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-15}
d\epsilon _{ab}=-d\epsilon _{ba}~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The transformations are taken to be active; that is, the transformed tetrad moves $+v$ and is rotated $\theta$ relative to the untransformed tetrad.
Thus the infinitesimal generator is
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-16}
d\epsilon _{ab}=
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
 0 & -dv _1& -dv_2& -dv _3\\
dv_1& 0 & -d\theta _{12} & d\theta _{31}\\
d v_2 & d\theta _{12} & 0 & -d\theta _{23}\\
dv_3 &-d\theta _{31} & d\theta _{23} & 0 \end{array} \right )
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The change in the tetrad resulting from this transformation is
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{l81-17}
\dot V_{a}^{\mu}=(d\epsilon _{a}^{b}/ds)V_{b}^{\mu}~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Equations (\ref{l81-17}) are identical to the Frenet equations (\ref{l81-6}); therefore, the physical content of the curvature invariants is found by comparison of 
(\ref{l81-9}) and (\ref{l81-16}). 

\bigskip
{\em Physical interpretation of the FS invariants}

\bigskip

\noindent
{\em  1. $\kappa$ is the proper acceleration of the world line which is always parallel to $V_{1}^{\mu}$.} 

\bigskip
\noindent
{\em 2. $\tau _1$ and $\tau _2$ are the components of proper angular velocity of the world line in the planes spanned by $V_{1}^{\mu}$ and $V_{2}^{\mu}$, and $V_{2}^{\mu}$ and $V_{3}^{\mu}$, respectively. The total proper angular velocity is the vector sum of these two invariants}.

\bigskip
\newpage

{\em Stationary Motions}

\bigskip

\noindent
The simplest worldlines are those whose curvature invariants are constant. They are called {\em stationary} because their geometric properties are independent of 
proper time. 
One also finds that only observers on these world lines may establish a coordinate system in which they are at rest and the metric is stationary. 
Clearly, the geodetic interval between two points on a stationary world line can depend only on the proper time interval, therefore they are the world lines on 
which a detector's excitation is time independent.

\bigskip

\noindent
The Frenet equation (\ref{l81-6}) may be reduced to a fourth-order linear equation in $V_{0}^{\mu}$ when the curvature invariants are constant
%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-18}
\stackrel{....}V_{0}^{\mu}-2a\ddot V_{0}^{\mu} -b^2 V_{0}^{\mu}=0~,
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%
where 
$$
a=\frac{1}{2}\left(\kappa ^2-\tau _1^2-\tau _2^2\right), \quad b=|\kappa \tau _2|~.
$$
The other basis vectors are determined from $V_{0}^{\mu}$ by the equations
%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-19}
V_1^{\mu}=\dot V_{0}^{\mu}/\kappa
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-20}
V_2^{\mu}=(\ddot V_0^{\mu}-\kappa ^2 V_0^{\mu})/\kappa \tau _1
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-21}
V_3^{\mu}=[\stackrel{...}V_0^{\mu}-(\kappa ^2-\tau _1^2)\dot V_0^{\mu}]/\kappa \tau _1 \tau _2~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip

\noindent
Equation (\ref{l81-18}) is homogeneous with constant coefficients. The four roots of the characteristic equation are $\pm R_{+}$ and $\pm i R_{-}$,
where
%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-22}
R_{\pm}=[(a^2+b^2)^{1/2}\pm a]^{1/2}~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The solution is of the form
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{l81-23}
V_{0}^{\mu}=A^{\mu}{\rm cosh}(R_{+}s)+B^{\mu}{\rm sinh}(R_{+}s)+C^{\mu}\cos (R_{-}s)+D^{\mu}\sin (R_{-}s)~.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Using (\ref{l81-19})-(\ref{l81-21}) and (\ref{l81-23}) at $s=0$ and the initial conditions $(V_{a}^{\mu})_{s=0}=\delta _{a}^{\mu}$ one can get the following 
expressions for the coefficients
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{eqnarray}
A^{\mu}=R^{-2}(R_{-}^{2}+\kappa ^2, 0, \kappa \tau _1, 0)~,\\
B^{\mu}=R^{-2}(0,\kappa(R_{-}^{2}+\kappa ^2 -\tau ^2)/R_{+},0,\kappa \tau _1 \tau _2/R_{+})~,\\
C^{\mu}=R^{-2}(R_{+}^{2}-\kappa ^2, 0, -\kappa \tau _1, 0)~,\\
D^{\mu}=R^{-2}(0,\kappa(R_{+}^{2}-\kappa ^2 +\tau ^2)/R_{-},0,-\kappa \tau _1 \tau _2/R_{-})~,\\
\end{eqnarray}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
with $R^2=R_{+}^{2}+R_{-}^{2}$. From these results on the FS tetrad one gets easily the six classes of stationary world lines and the corresponding 
excitation spectra.

{\em The Six Stationary Scalar Frenet-Serret Radiation Spectra}


\bigskip
\noindent
\underline{{\bf 1}. $\kappa =\tau _1=\tau _2=0$} $\qquad$  (inertial, uncurved worldlines)

\bigskip
\noindent
The excitation spectrum is a trivial cubic spectrum 

\bigskip
%%%%%% 
\begin{equation} 
S_{\rm recta}(E)=\frac{E^3}{4\pi ^2}~, 
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%% 
i.e., as given by a vacuum of zero point energy per mode $E/2$ 
and density of states $E^2/2\pi ^2$.

\bigskip 
\noindent 
\underline{{\bf 2}. $\kappa \neq 0$, $\tau _1=\tau _2=0$} $\qquad$ (hyperbolic worldlines)

\bigskip
\noindent
The excitation spectrum is Planckian allowing the 
interpretation of $\kappa/2\pi$ as `thermodynamic' temperature. In the 
dimensionless variable $\epsilon _{\kappa}=E/\kappa$ the vacuum spectrum reads 

\bigskip
%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation} 
S_{\rm hyp}(\epsilon _{\kappa}) 
=\frac{\epsilon _{\kappa}^{3}}{2\pi ^2(e^{2\pi\epsilon _{\kappa}}-1)}~. 
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip 
\noindent 
\underline{{\bf 3}. $|\kappa|<|\tau _1|$, $\tau _2=0$, $\rho ^2=\tau _1 ^2-\kappa ^2$} $\qquad$ (helical worldlines) 

\bigskip
\noindent
The excitation spectrum is an analytic function corresponding to the case 4 below only in the limit $\kappa\gg \rho$ 
%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation} 
S_{\rm hel}(\epsilon _{\rho})\stackrel{\kappa/\rho\rightarrow \infty} 
{\longrightarrow} S_{\rm 3/2-parab}(\epsilon _{\kappa})~. 
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
Letaw plotted the numerical integral $S_{\rm hel}(\epsilon _{\rho})$, 
where $\epsilon _{\rho}=E/\rho$ for various values of $\kappa/\rho$.

\bigskip 
\noindent 
\underline{{\bf 4}. $\kappa=\tau _1$, $\tau _2=0$}, $\quad$ (if spatially projected: semicubical parabolas $y=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\kappa x^{3/2}$) 

\bigskip
%(the spatially projected worldlines are the semicubical parabolas 
%$y=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\kappa x^{3/2}$ 
%This parabolas contain a cusp where the direction of motion is reversed. 

\noindent
The excitation spectrum is analytic, and 
since there are two equal curvature invariants one can use the 
dimensionless energy variable $\epsilon _{\kappa}$ 
%(for mathematical details see the Appendix) 
%but is not Planckian)

\bigskip 
%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation} 
S_{\rm 3/2-parab}(\epsilon _{\kappa})= \frac{\epsilon _{\kappa}^{2}}{8\pi ^2 \sqrt{3}} 
e^{-2\sqrt{3}\epsilon _{\kappa}}~. 
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
It is worth noting that $S_{\rm 3/2-parab}$, being a monomial times an exponential, 
is quite close to the Wien-type spectrum 
$S_{W}\propto\epsilon ^3e^{- {\rm const.}\epsilon}$.

\bigskip 
\noindent 
\underline{{\bf 5}.  $|\kappa|>|\tau _1|$, $\tau _2=0$, $\sigma ^2=\kappa ^2-\tau _1 ^2$} $\quad$ (if spatially projected: catenaries
$x=\kappa \cosh (y/\tau)$) 

\bigskip
%(the spatially projected worldlines are catenaries, i.e., curves of the type 
%$x=\kappa \cosh (y/\tau)$). 

\noindent
In general, the catenary spectrum cannot be found 
analytically. It is an intermediate case, which 
for $\tau/\sigma\rightarrow 0$ tends to $S_{\rm hyp}$, 
whereas for $\tau/\sigma\rightarrow\infty$ tends toward $S_{\rm 3/2-parab}$ 

\bigskip
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation} 
S_{\rm hyp}(\epsilon _{\kappa}) 
\stackrel{0\leftarrow \tau/\sigma}{\longleftarrow} 
S_{\rm catenary}(\epsilon _{\sigma})\stackrel{\tau/\sigma\rightarrow \infty} 
{\longrightarrow}S_{\rm 3/2-parab}(\epsilon _{\kappa})~. 
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\bigskip 
\noindent 
\underline{{\bf 6}. $\tau _2 \neq 0$} $\quad$ (rotating worldlines uniformly accelerated normal to their plane of rotation)

\bigskip 
%(rotating worldlines uniformly accelerated normal to their plane of rotation). 

\noindent
The excitation spectrum is given in this case by a two-parameter set of curves. These trajectories are 
a superposition of the constant linearly accelerated motion and uniform 
circular motion. The corresponding vacuum spectra have not been calculated 
by Letaw, not even numerically.

\bigskip
\noindent
Thus, only the hyperbolic worldlines, having just one nonzero curvature 
invariant, allow for a Planckian excitation spetrum and lead to a strictly one-to-one 
mapping between the curvature invariant $\kappa$ and the `thermodynamic' 
temperature ($T_{U}=\kappa /2\pi$). The excitation spectrum due to  semicubical 
parabolas can be fitted by Wien-type spectra, the radiometric parameter 
corresponding to both curvature and torsion. 
The other stationary cases, being nonanalytical, lead to 
approximate determination of the curvature invariants, defining locally the 
classical worldline on which a relativistic quantum particle moves.

One can easily infer from these conclusions the reason why the Unruh effect became so prominent 
with regard to the other five types of stationary Frenet-Serret scalar spectra.

\bigskip
\noindent
I mention that Letaw introduced the terminology  {\em ultratorsional}, {\em paratorsional}, {\em infratorsional}, and {\em hypertorsional}
for the scalar stationary cases {\bf 3}-{\bf 6}.

%\subsection{Circular FS radiation}

%------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{\bf The Electromagnetic Vacuum Noise} 
%------------------------------------------------------ 

For the case of homogeneous electromagnetic field, Honig {\em et al} proved that the FS scalars remain constant along the worldline of a charged 
particle, whereas the FS vectors obey a Lorentz force equation of the form
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{L1}
\dot u ^{\mu}=\bar F^{\mu}_{\nu}u^{\nu}
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
with $F_{\mu \nu}=\lambda \bar F^{\mu}_{\nu}$, the electromagnetic field tensor, $\lambda =e/mc^2$, and  $\dot u ^{\mu}$ the four-velocity of the particle. 

A remarkable physical interpretation of the FS invariants in terms of the Lorentz invariants of the electromagnetic field was established by Honig {\em et al}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}\label{lorinv}
\kappa ^2-\tau _1^2-\tau _2^2  = \lambda^2(E^2-H^2)~,\qquad
\kappa \tau _2  =  -\lambda ^2(\vec{E}\cdot \vec{H})
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These beautiful results passed quite unnoticed until now. They could be used for a geometric transcription of homogeneous electromagnetism
and therefore for the geometric `calibration' of electromagnetic phenomena.

The FS formalism has not been used for the electromagnetic vacuum noise. Other approaches have been undertaken for this important case of which 
a rather complete one is due to Hacyan and Sarmiento that is briefly presented in the following.

\bigskip
{\em The Hacyan-Sarmiento approach}


\bigskip
\noindent
Starting with the expression for the electromagnetic energy-momentum 
tensor 
\begin{equation} 
\label{hs1} 
T_{\mu \nu}=\frac{1}{16\pi}\left( 
4F_{\mu \alpha}\;F_{\nu}^{\alpha}+ 
\eta _{\mu \nu}\;F_{\lambda \beta}\;F^{\lambda \beta} 
\right)~, 
\end{equation} 
Hacyan--Sarmiento define the electromagnetic two-point Wightman 
functions as follows 
\begin{equation} 
\label{hs2} 
D_{\mu \nu}^{+}(x,x')\equiv 
\frac{1}{4} 
\left( 
4F^\alpha{}_{(\mu}(x) \;F_{\nu )\alpha}(x')+ 
\eta _{\mu \nu}\; F_{\lambda \beta}(x)\; F^{\lambda \beta}(x')\right); 
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation} 
\label{hs3} 
D_{\mu \nu}^{-}(x,x')\equiv D_{\mu \nu}^{+}(x',x). 
\end{equation} 
This may be viewed as a variant of the ``point-splitting'' approach 
advocated by DeWitt.  Moreover, because of the properties 
% 
\begin{equation} 
\label{hs4} 
\eta^{\mu \nu}\;D_{\mu \nu}^{\pm}=0, 
\qquad D_{\mu \nu}^{\pm}=D_{\nu \mu}^{\pm}, 
\qquad 
\partial _{\nu}D_{\mu}^{\pm \nu}=0, 
\end{equation} 
% 
the electromagnetic Wightman functions can be expressed in terms of 
the scalar Wightman functions as follows 
% 
\begin{equation} 
\label{hs5} 
D_{\mu \nu}^{\pm}(x,x')=c\; \partial_\mu \; \partial_\nu \;D^{\pm}(x,x'), 
\end{equation} 
% 
where $c$ is in general a real constant depending on the case under 
study.  This shows that from the standpoint of their vacuum 
fluctuations the scalar and the electromagnetic fields are not so 
different.

Now introduce sum and difference variables 
% 
\begin{equation} 
s = {t + t'\over2}; \qquad \sigma = {t-t'\over2}. 
\end{equation} 
% 
Using the Fourier transforms of the Wightman functions 
% 
\begin{equation} 
\label{ksy1} 
\tilde{D}^{\pm}(\omega , s)= 
\int _{-\infty}^{\infty} d\sigma \; 
e^{-i\omega \sigma}\; D^{\pm}(s,\sigma), 
\end{equation} 
% 
where $\omega$ is the frequency of zero-point fields, the {\em 
particle number density of the vacuum seen by the moving detector} and 
the {\em spectral vacuum energy density per mode} are given by 
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{ksy2} 
n(\omega , s)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^2 \omega} 
\left[ 
\tilde{D}^{+}(\omega , s )- 
\tilde{D}^{-}(\omega , s ) 
\right], 
\end{equation} 
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation} \label{ksy3} 
\frac{d e}{d\omega}=\frac{\omega ^2}{\pi} 
\left[ 
\tilde{D}^{+}(\omega , s )+ 
\tilde{D}^{-}(\omega , s ) 
\right]. 
\end{equation} 

\bigskip

{\em Circular worldline}

\bigskip
\noindent
The most important application of these results is to a uniformly 
rotating detector whose proper time is $s$ and angular speed is 
$\omega _{0}$ in motion along the circular world line 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{equation} 
\label{hswl} 
x^{\alpha}(s)= 
(\gamma s, R_{0}\cos (\omega _{0}s), 
R_{0}\sin (\omega _{0}s), 0), 
\end{equation} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
where $R_{0}$ is the rotation radius in the inertial frame, 
$\gamma =(1-v^2)^{-1/2}$, and $v={\omega _0 R_0}/{\gamma}$. 
%\footnote{% 
%--------------------------------------------- 
%This is correct for Galilean electromagnetism and works well at low 
%velocities and/or in gradient index (lens) media. For full Lorentz 
%covariant electrodynamics, one should use the Trocheris-Takeno 
%nonlinear relationship $v=\tanh (\omega R_0/c)$. See, {\emph{e.g.}}, 
%\cite{TT}.} 
%----------------------------------------------- 
In this case there are two Killing vectors $k^{\alpha}=(1,0,0,0)$ and 
$ m^{\alpha}(s)=(0,-R_{0}\sin(\omega_{0}s), R_{0} 
\cos(\omega_{0}s,0)$. Expressing the Wightman functions in terms of 
these two Killing vectors, HS calculated the following physically 
observable spectral quantities (i.e., those obtained after subtracting 
the inertial zero-point field contributions):

%------------------------------------------- 
\begin{itemize} 
%------------------------------------------- 
\item {\em The spectral energy density} 
%------------------------------------------- 
\begin{equation} \label{hsA} 
\frac{d e}{d\omega}= 
\frac{\gamma ^3}{2\pi ^3 R_{0}^{3}} \; 
\frac{\omega ^2+(\gamma v \omega _{0})^2}{\omega ^2} \; 
\frac{v^3w^2}{w^2+(2\gamma v)^2} \; 
h_{\gamma}(w), 
\end{equation} 
%------------------------------------------- 
\item {\em The spectral flux density} 
%------------------------------------------- 
\begin{equation} \label{hsB} 
\frac{d p}{d\omega}= 
\frac{\gamma ^3}{2\pi ^3 R_{0}^{3}}\; 
\frac{\omega ^2+(\gamma v \omega _{0})^2}{\omega ^2}\; 
4v^4 \; k_{\gamma}(w), 
\end{equation} 
%------------------------------------------- 
\item {\em The spectral stress density} 
%------------------------------------------- 
\begin{equation} \label{hsC} 
\frac{d s}{d\omega}= 
\frac{\gamma ^3}{2\pi ^3 R_{0}^{3}}\; 
\frac{\omega ^2+(\gamma v \omega _{0})^2}{\omega ^2}\; 
\frac{v^3w^2}{w^2+(2\gamma v)^2}\; 
j_{\gamma}(w). 
\end{equation} 
%------------------------------------------- 
\end{itemize} 
%-------------------------------------------

The ratio $(\omega ^2+(\gamma v \omega _{0})^2)/\omega ^2$ is a 
density-of-states factor introduced for convenience. 

\bigskip
\noindent
The Hacyan-Sarmiento variables are 
$$w=\frac{2\omega}{\omega _{0}} \qquad x=\frac{\sigma \omega _{0}}{2}$$ 

%\bigskip
\noindent
$h_{\gamma}(w)$, $k_{\gamma}(w)$, and $j_{\gamma}(w)$ are the 
following cosine-Fourier transforms 
% 
\begin{equation} 
\label{hsD} 
h_{\gamma}(w)\equiv   %\frac{v^3w^2}{w^2+(2\gamma v)^2} 
\int _{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{N_h(x,v)} 
%(3+v^2)x^2+(v^2+3v^4)\sin ^2x-8v^2x \sin x}"
