One of the main examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence is the duality
between type IIB string theory on AdS$_3 \times S^3\times M^4$ and
certain two-dimensional conformal field theories~\cite{Mald97}. The
spectrum of $N=(2,0)$ supergravity on AdS$_3 \times S^3$ has been
computed in~\cite{DKSS98,Lars98,dBoe99}, in three dimensions this is a
half-maximal, i.e.\ $N=8$ theory. In~\cite{NicSam01b} we have shown
that the lowest multiplets of this spectrum together with the expected
global and local symmetries are reproduced by a three-dimensional
theory~\Ref{LCS} with coset space $\SO{8,n}/(\SO{8}\cro\SO{n})$, and
CS gauge group $\SO{4}$, where $n$ denotes the number of tensor
multiplets in six dimensions. An outstanding question has been the
coupling of this theory to the YM vector multiplet containing
additional 26 scalars. In view of the above results, one may now
verify that this larger theory may be described by a coset space
$\SO{8,4\pls n}/(\SO{8}\cro\SO{4\pls n})$ and CS gauge group
$\SO{4}\ltimes {\rm T}_6$. This $\SO{4}$ is embedded as a certain
diagonal of two factors in the $\SO{8}$ and the $\SO{4\pls n}$,
respectively, such that the scalar spectrum decomposes as $\big(8,
(n\pls4)\big)\rightarrow n\cdot4 + 4n\cdot1 + 1+9+4\cdot4 + 3_+ +
3_-$. Eliminating the six abelian translations as described in
section~\ref{CSYM} leads to a YM $\SO{4}$ gauged theory~\Ref{LYM}
coupling 26+8$n$ scalar fields.  Details of this construction will be
presented in~\cite{NicSam03b}. Surprisingly, using the results of
section~\ref{MVF} and a particular coset space, it is even possible to
describe the coupling of multiplets from arbitrary~(!)  levels of the
massive spin-1 KK towers.

The near horizon limit of the so-called ``double D1-D5 system''
describes an AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times S^3$ geometry. The supergravity
spectrum on this background has been computed in~\cite{dBPaSk99}. The
three-dimensional theory describing the lowest mass multiplets again
is organized by a coset space $\SO{8,n}/(\SO{8}\cro\SO{n})$, now with
gauge group $\SO{4}\times\SO{4}$~\cite{NicSam01b}. Similar to the
construction given above, one may further couple the two YM multiplets
by a proper enlargement of the coset space to
$\SO{8,8+n}/(\SO{8}\cro\SO{8+n})$ and embedding a gauge group
$\SO{4}_{\rm diag}\times\SO{4}_{\rm diag}$ together with the
corresponding nilpotent directions.

Recently, the reduction of of six-dimensional $N=(1,0)$ supergravity
on AdS$_3 \times \SU{2}$, has been performed in~\cite{LuPoSe02}. The
field content of the three-dimensional $N=4$ theory comprises three YM
gauge fields together with three massive vector fields and six scalars
parametrizing the coset space ${\rm GL}(3)/\SO{3}$. This spectrum
suggests that the CS version \Ref{LCS} of this theory is governed by
the larger coset space $\SO{4,3}/(\SO{4}\times\SO{3})$ with gauge
group $\SO{3}_{\rm diag}\ltimes (\hat{\rm T}_{3}, {\rm T}_{3})$. The
group $\SO{4,3}$ indeed has a unique subgroup of this type, whose
algebra generators satisfy relations of the type \Ref{algebra},
\Ref{algebra_ext}. Its semi-simple part is embedded as the diagonal of
the three $\SO{3}$ factors in the compact $\SO{4}\times\SO{3}$, such
that the 12 scalars decompose as $12\rightarrow 1+3+3+5$. Eliminating
the three abelian translations and gauge-fixing the other three
nilpotent directions as described in section~\ref{MVF} leads to a
theory~\Ref{LYM_exta} with the desired spectrum. Indeed, the couplings
appearing in~\Ref{LYM_exta} for this case are of the form
found in~\cite{LuPoSe02}.

The reduction of six-dimensional $N=(1,0)$ supergravity on
AdS$_3 \times S^3$ leads to a three-dimensional $N=4$ theory, whose
spectrum has been computed in~\cite{DKSS98,dBoe99}. The resulting
theory will be described by a coset space
$\SO{4,4}/(\SO{4}\cro\SO{4})$ and CS gauge group $\SO{4}_{\rm
diag}\ltimes {\rm T}_{6}$ embedded such that the scalar spectrum
correctly decomposes as $16\rightarrow 1+ 3_+ + 3_- + 9$, of which the
$3_+ + 3_-$ transforming in the adjoint representation of $\SO{4}_{\rm
diag}$ are eliminated according to section~\ref{CSYM}.

The compactification of simple five-dimensional supergravity on $S^2$
whose KK spectrum has been analyzed in \cite{dBoe99,FuKeMi98,Suga99}
should be related to proper gaugings of the $N\equ4$ theory with coset
space~$\EG22/\SO{4}$. The CS gauge group is a $\SO{3}_{\rm
diag}\ltimes {\rm T}_{3}$ under whose semisimple part the scalar
spectrum decomposes as $8\rightarrow 3+5$.

\item[$-$]
The most interesting example is the (warped) compactification of
ten-dimensional supergravity on~$S^7$. For the type I theory, the
reduction has been performed explicitly in~\cite{CvLuPo00}. We may
recover that theory by starting from an $N=8$ theory \Ref{LCS} with
coset space $\SO{8,8}/(\SO{8}\times\SO{8})$, and CS gauge group
$\SO{8}_{\rm diag}\ltimes {\rm T}_{28}$ upon eliminating the $28$
translations, leading to an $\SO{8}$ gauged YM theory~\Ref{LYM} with
$36$ scalar fields. Using the above results, it is then
straightforward to extend this construction to the maximally
supersymmetric theories which are supposed to describe the
compactifications of type IIA/IIB theory on $S^7$, and whose spectra have
been given in~\cite{MorSam02}. These two  different compactifications
correspond to two inequivalent embeddings of the gauge group
$\SO{8}_{\rm diag}\ltimes {\rm T}_{28}$ into $\EE88$.
Details will appear in \cite{FiNiSa03}.
