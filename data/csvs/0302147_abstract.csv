  We give an introduction to a 
  new approach to the covariant quantization of superstrings. 
  After a brief review of the classical Green--Schwarz 
  superstring and Berkovits' approach to its quantization based on 
  pure spinors, we discuss our covariant formulation without pure spinor 
  constraints. We discuss the relation between the concept of grading, 
  which we introduced to define vertex operators, and 
  homological perturbation theory, and we compare our work with recent 
  work by others. In the appendices, 
  we include some background material for the Green-Schwarz and 
  Berkovits formulations, in order that this presentation be self 
  contained.
