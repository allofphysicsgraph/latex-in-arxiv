We investigate a non-perturbative vacuum in open string field theory
expanded around the analytic classical solution which has been found
in the universal Fock space generated by matter Virasoro generators
and ghost oscillators. We carry out level-truncation analyses up to
level (6,\,18) in the theory around one-parameter families of the
solution. We observe that the value of the vacuum energy approaches the
D-brane tension as the approximation level is increased, but this
non-perturbative vacuum disappears at the boundary of the parameter
space. These results provide strong evidence for the conjecture that,
although the universal solutions are pure gauge in almost all the
parameter space, they are regarded as the tachyon vacuum solution at
the boundary.
