In this paper, a general theory on unification of non-Abelian
$SU(N)$ gauge interactions and gravitational interactions
is discussed. $SU(N)$ gauge interactions and gravitational 
interactions are formulated on the similar basis and are 
unified in a semi-direct product group $GSU(N)$. Based on
this model, we can discuss unification of fundamental 
interactions of Nature.
