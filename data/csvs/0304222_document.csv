\begin{abstract}
Nonperturbative treatments of the UV limit of pure gravity
suggest that it admits a stable fixed point with positive
Newton's constant and cosmological constant.
We prove that this result is stable under the addition of 
a scalar field with a generic potential
and nonminimal couplings to the scalar curvature.
There is a fixed point where the mass 
and all nonminimal scalar interactions vanish while 
the gravitational couplings have values which are almost 
identical to the pure gravity case.
We discuss the linearized flow around this fixed point
and find that the critical surface is four-dimensional.
In the presence of other, arbitrary, massless minimally 
coupled matter fields, the existence of the fixed point,
the sign of the cosmological constant and the dimension of the
critical surface depend on the type and number of fields. 
In particular, for some matter content,
there exist polynomial asymptotically
free scalar potentials, thus providing a 
solution to the well-known problem of triviality.

\section{Introduction}

The failure of perturbative approaches to quantum gravity does not
necessarily imply that quantum gravity does not exist as a field
theory. There is still in principle the possibility that the theory
could be ``nonperturbatively quantized''.
To understand what this means, one has to look at the
Renormalization Group (RG), \emph{i.\ e.}\ the flow of the coupling
constants $\tilde g_i(k)$ as a certain external momentum parameter $k$ is changed%
\footnote{the precise physical meaning of the parameter $k$ depends
on the specific problem that one is addressing; it is usually
the momentum of some particle entering into the process under
study, or the inverse of some characteristic lenght of the system.
In general, $k$ has the meaning of an IR cutoff, because the
effective theory describing the process must include the effect of
all the fluctuations of the fields with momenta larger than $k$.}.
It is customary to take $k$ as unit of mass; if $\tilde g_i$ has
dimension $d_i$ in units of mass, we define
dimensionless couplings $g_i=\tilde g_i k^{-d_i}$.
The RG flow is then given by the integral curves of a vectorfield $\beta$
in the space of all couplings, whose components 
$\beta_i(g)=\partial_t g_i$ (with $t=\ln k$)
are the beta functions.
A Fixed Point (FP) is a point $g_*$ in the space of all couplings where 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fp}
\beta_i(g_*)=0\ .
\end{equation}
For example, in ordinary quantum field theories in Minkowski space,
the point where all couplings vanish is always a FP
(called the Gaussian FP),
because a free field theory does not have quantum corrections.

Suppose that the theory admits a FP.
One defines the critical surface to be the locus of points
that, under the RG evolution, are attracted towards the FP for $t\to\infty$. 
Starting from any point on the critical surface, 
the UV limit can be taken safely, because the couplings,
and as a consequence the physical reaction rates,
will be drawn towards the FP and hence remain finite
\footnote{In general in the action there will be couplings
whose values do not affect cross-sections and reaction rates. 
They are called inessential couplings.
Our reasoning applies only to the essential couplings.}
On the other hand, if one starts from a point not belonging to the 
critical surface, the RG evolution will generally lead to
divergences.
If the critical surface has finite dimension $c$, 
the theory will be predictive, because only $c-1$ parameters
will be left undetermined and
will have to be fixed by experiment at a given energy scale
(the last remaining parameter being the scale itself).
The special case when the FP with a finite dimensional critical 
surface is the Gaussian FP is equivalent to
the usual perturbative notion of renormalizability 
and asymptotic freedom.

This scenario for nonperturbative renormalizability has been discussed
specifically in a gravitational context in \cite{Weinberg:1979} where
this good property was called ``asymptotic safety''.  At the time some
encouraging results were obtained by studying gravity in $2+\epsilon$
dimensions \cite{Weinberg:1979,Gastmans:1978ad}%
%,Christensen:1978sc,Kawai:1990yh,Jack:1991ey,Kawai:1993fq,Aida:1995dv}
, but the program soon came to a
halt essentially for want of technical tools.  It now appears that the
right tool to tackle this problem is the Exact RG Equation (ERGE), in
one of several guises that have appeared in the literature in the last
decade
\cite{Polchinski:1984gv,Bagnuls:2000ae,%Berges:2000ew}
Wetterich:1993yh}.

The ERGE is a differential equation that determines the RG flow of the
action. It can be viewed as a set of infinitely many first order 
differential equations for infinitely many variables (the coupling constants),
and therefore cannot generally be solved in practice.
A method that is commonly used to calculate nonperturbative beta functions is to
make a physically motivated Ansatz for the running effective action, 
typically containing a finite number of parameters, and insert this Ansatz
into the ERGE.

The ERGE, in the specific form discussed in \cite{Wetterich:1993yh},
has been applied to Einstein's theory in \cite{Reuter:1998cp,Dou:1998fg},
where the beta functions for Newton's constant and for the
cosmological constant were derived.
It was later realized that these beta functions actually admit
a nontrivial UV-attractive FP \cite{Souma:1999at}. 
The properties of this FP were further discussed in greater detail
in \cite{Lauscher:2001ya}. 
A particularly important issue is to prove that the FP 
is not an artifact of the Ansatz but is a genuine property of gravitation.
Several facts seem to indicate that the FP is quite robust.
It has been shown to exists in four spacetime dimensions for many 
different shapes of the cutoff, whereas in other dimensions
it only exists for certain cutoffs but not others.
Its properties have been shown to be only weakly dependent on the
shape of the cutoff, indicating that the truncation is self-consistent
\cite{Lauscher:2001rz}%,Lauscher:2001cq,}
.
It has been found in certain dimensionally-reduced versions
of the theory \cite{Forgacs:2002hz}.
It is also remarkable that Newton's constant always turns out to be
positive, a fact that could not in any way be guaranteed by
the general form of the equations.

The most important test, however, is the stability of the FP
against the addition of new couplings.
Each time we consider a new coupling,
whether remaining in the context of pure gravity
or if we introduce matter fields,
a new beta function has to vanish and therefore a new constraint 
has to be satisfied by the set of all couplings at the FP.  
It is therefore nontrivial that the FP still exists when we take 
into account additional couplings.

In the context of pure gravity, an important progress was made in
\cite{Lauscher:2002mb}, where it was shown
that the addition of a term quadratic in curvature does not spoil the
existence of the FP. In fact it turned out that the values of the
cosmological and Newton's constants at the FP are almost unaffected by
the new interaction, while the new coupling constant is quite small at
the FP.  This is far from being conclusive evidence, but it is
nevertheless an important result,
especially in view of the fact that another FP that was present in the
truncation with only two couplings---the Gaussian FP---does not exist
in the three coupling truncation.

As far as matter is concerned, we have recently considered the effect 
of minimally coupled, massless quantum fields of arbitrary spin \cite{Percacci:2002ie}. 
The only couplings taken into account were the
cosmological and Newton's constant, since the coefficients of the
matter kinetic terms can be normalized to their standard values by
field rescalings. It was shown that the existence of the FP,
the values of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant
at the FP and the dimension of the critical surface all depend on the 
type and number of fields present.  Altogether, the existence and
attractiveness of the FP puts some constraints on the number of matter
fields that are present.

In this paper we continue the analysis of coupled gravity and matter
systems and we begin to address the issue of matter couplings. 
There are many different couplings that are necessary to construct
realistic theories of the world, and we cannot possibly
take them all into account, so as a first step we shall consider
the simplest example, that of a self-interacting scalar field.
Aside from its role as a model for the Higgs field in unified theories,
a scalar field (the dilaton) appears in many popular theories of gravity.
It can therefore sometimes be regarded as part of the gravitational
sector, rather than the matter sector. This makes its properties
especially interesting in a gravitational context.
In this paper we shall not make any assumption about the physical
interpretation of the scalar field.

The class of actions that we consider is
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:class}
\Gamma[g,\phi]=\int\,\mathrm{d}^4x\sqrt{g}\left(V(\phi^2)- F(\phi^2)R
+{1\over2}g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi\right)
\end{equation}
%
where the potential $V$ and the scalar-tensor coupling $F$
are arbitrary real analytic functions. (The RGEs for this system
have been studied earlier in \cite{Barvinsky:1993zg} 
Although it is not necessary for some of the results of this
paper, we shall assume that the potential has its minimum
at the origin. Then, we can identify
$F(0)=\kappa\equiv 1/16\pi G$, $G$ being Newton's constant, and 
$V(0)=2\kappa\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$
is the (dimension-two) cosmological constant.
It will appear that the behaviour of the couplings implicit
in the functions $V$ and $F$ is sufficiently systematic that
we are actually able to draw several conclusions involving an infinite
number of couplings.
For some purposes, however, we shall restrict our attention
to a five-parameter Ansatz, where $V$ is at most quartic in $\phi$
and $F$ is at most quadratic.

Aside from establishing the existence of a nontrivial FP,
the main question addressed in this paper will be the dimension 
of the critical surface.
In practice, this is done by linearizing the flow around the FP.
We define $v_i=g_i-g_{i*}$ the shift from the fixed point.
The linearized flow around the fixed point is described by the equations
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:linrg}
\partial_t v_i=M_{ij}v_j,
\end{equation}
where $M_{ij}={\partial \beta_i\over\partial g_j}$.
Let $P$  be the (generally complex) linear transformation that 
diagonalizes $M$:
$P^{-1}MP=diag(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_N)$
(the columns of $P$ are the eigenvectors of $M$).
Defining $f=P^{-1}v$, one finds $\partial_t f_k=\alpha_k f_k$, so
$f_k(t)=e^{\alpha_k t}$.
Transforming back to the original variables,
the solution can be written 
$g_i(t)=g_{i*}+{\rm Re}(P_{ij} f_j(t))$.
It is easy to show that the eigenvalues $\alpha_i$ are
invariant under redefinitions of the couplings.

The eigenvalues with negative real part (which for brevity we shall call
the ``negative eigenvalues'') correspond to directions for which
the RG flow approaches the FP in the UV. 
The corresponding parameter $f_i$ is called a relevant parameter.
Those with positive real part (the ``positive eigenvalues'')
correspond to directions for which
the RG flow moves away from the FP in the UV.
The corresponding parameter $f_i$ is called an irrelevant parameter.
The parameters corresponding to purely imaginary eigenvalues are called marginal.
In the linearized theory, in order to approach the FP in the UV it is
therefore necessary to stay on the hyperplane spanned by the
eigenvectors with negative eigenvalues.
This hyperplane is the tangent space to the critical surface at the FP.
Therefore, the dimension of the critical surface is equal to
the number of negative eigenvalues.
On general grounds, one expects the critical surface to be finite dimensional.
In this way all but a finite number of couplings would be
fixed and the theory would be as predictive as a perturbatively
renormalizable theory.

We now give a brief summary of the results of this paper.
First of all, a nontrivial FP still exists with the Ansatz \eqref{eq:class}. 
The purely gravitational couplings (cosmological constant and Newton's constant,
which appear as the $\phi^2$-independent terms in the functions $V$ and $F$)
have the same values as in \cite{Percacci:2002ie}
and all the other couplings are equal to zero.
In a sense this is therefore ``the same'' fixed point that was considered
in \cite{Souma:1999at} and in \cite{Lauscher:2001ya,Reuter:2001ag}. 
It can also be regarded as a generalization of the Gaussian FP
of the pure scalar theory in flat space.
We therefore call it the Gaussian-Matter FP (GMFP).
We have performed a systematic search for other FP's
within a five-parameter truncation of the action, where $V$ and $F$
are polynomials containing at most terms of order $\phi^4$ and $\phi^2$
respectively.
Thus, in addition to the cosmological and Newton's
constant, we consider a scalar mass term, a quartic
self-interaction and a nonminimal coupling of the scalar field
to the scalar curvature.
Detailed numerical analyses have convinced us that there are no FP's
with nonzero scalar mass and couplings, for values of the
cosmological and Newton constant close to the ones of the pure-gravity FP.

Comparing to the results of the pure scalar theory,
the main effect of the coupling to gravity is to change the exponents
$\alpha_i$.
It turns out that of the two canonically marginal couplings, 
the $\phi^4$ coupling becomes irrelevant while the $\phi^2 R$
coupling becomes relevant. The other couplings preserve the character that
is implied by their canonical dimension; the critical dimension would thus 
be equal to four.

We then look at the effect of other matter fields on the FP.
The results of this investigation generalize those already reported
in \cite{Percacci:2002ie}. 
The behaviour of the beta functions is determined by two parameters
that depend on the number of fields, and the existence of the FP
depends on the values of these parameters.
In this way the existence of the FP yields constraints on the type 
and number of matter fields. These constraints appear to be satisfied 
by popular unified models.
The existence region is subdivided into subregions with varying numbers
of attractive directions. 
In the region that we have explored, comprising large numbers of matter
fields, the dimension of the critical surface is always finite.
In particular, there are regions in which the attractive directions correspond to
nontrivial polynomial potentials of degree four or higher.
This yields a neat solution of a long-standing puzzle.
In a pure scalar theory in flat space, the Gaussian FP is IR attractive
(all couplings are irrelevant). As a consequence, when one takes the
continuum limit at the Gaussian FP, the renormalized theory is free.
This result is not an obstacle in the context of an effective field theory,
but it has to be somehow circumvented if scalar fields have to appear in
a fundamental field theory. The coupling to gravity is a natural context
for a solution of this issue. Our results imply that there exist theories of gravity
coupled to matter such that the renormalized scalar potential has finitely
many nonzero couplings in the continuum limit.
This seems to indicate that the interaction with gravity 
(and, indirectly, with the other matter fields) solves the problem of the 
triviality of the scalar theory.

This paper is organized as follows.
In Section II, by way of introduction, we derive the ERGE and we 
use it to prove some well-known
results on the Gaussian FP of a pure scalar theory in flat space.
In Section III we consider the modifications of the beta functions
due to gravity, we prove the existence of the Gaussian-Matter FP (GMFP) and
we discuss the (negative) results of the numerical search 
for other FP's.
Section IV is devoted to the properties of the GMFP.
We analyze the linearized flow around the
GMFP and show that the coupling to gravity affects the
dimensions of the couplings, shifting them relative to the
canonical values.
In Section V we consider the effect of other massless,
minimally coupled matter fields on the GMFP. 
In Section VI we will consider in some detail the
dependence of our results on the shape of
the cutoff function and on the gauge--fixing parameter.
Finally in Section VII we make some concluding remarks.

All results are derived in the case of Euclidean signature,
in four dimensions.
Since the expressions of the beta functions are extremely lengthy,
in deriving our results
we have made extensive use of algebraic manipulation software.

\section{The Gaussian FP in pure scalar theory}
%
We begin by considering the case of a single scalar field without
gravity and a generic even potential
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:scalar_potential}
V(\phi)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \tilde\lambda_{2n}\phi^{2n}.
\end{equation}
%
In this section we assume that 
$V(0)=\tilde\lambda_0=2\Lambda\kappa=0$;
the first nonzero term is the mass $\tilde\lambda_2={1\over2}m^2$,
while $\tilde\lambda_4$ is the usual quartic coupling.
The couplings $\tilde\lambda_{2n}$ have dimension $mass^{2(2-n)}$,
so the usual power-counting arguments tell us that the terms
in \eqref{eq:scalar_potential} with $n>2$ are perturbatively 
nonrenormalizable, while the term $n=2$
is marginal. We will now rederive this result within the
formalism of the ERGEs. This will set the stage for
further developments in later sections.

To derive the ERGE, one begins by modifying the classical propagator
by adding to the action a term quadratic in the fields which in
momentum space can be written $\Delta S_k(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}\int d^4q
\phi(-q) R_k(z) \phi(q)$, where $z=q^2$.  The effect of this term must
be to suppress the propagation of field modes with momenta smaller
than $k$, while leaving the modes with momenta larger than $k$
unaffected.  This is the case if the smooth cutoff function $R_k$ is
chosen to tend to zero for $z\gg k^2$ and to a constant for $z\to 0$.
For numerical work, in this paper we will work with cutoffs of the
form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cutoff}
R_k(z)={2a z e^{-2az/k^2}\over 1-e^{-2az/k^2}}\ ,
\end{equation}
with $a$ a free parameter.
We then define a scale--dependent generating functional
of connected Green functions
$$
W_k[J]=-\mathrm{ln}\int (D\phi)\mathrm{exp}(-(S+\Delta S_k+\int J\phi))
$$
such that $\frac{\delta W_k}{\delta J}\Big|_{J=0}=\langle \phi \rangle$
and a scale-dependent effective action
$\Gamma_k[\phi_{cl}]=\tilde \Gamma_k[\phi_{cl}]-\Delta S_k[\phi_{cl}]$, 
where $\tilde \Gamma_k[\phi_{cl}]=W_k[J]-\int J\phi_{cl}$
is obtained from $W_k[J]$ by the usual Legendre-transform procedure.
The scale-dependent effective action tends to the bare action $S$
when $k$ tends to the UV cutoff, and to the ordinary effective
action for $k\to 0$.
We have
\begin{equation}
\partial_t W_k=\partial_t \langle\Delta S_k\rangle
=\frac12\mathrm{Tr}\langle\phi\phi\rangle\partial_t R_k,
\end{equation}
where the trace is over all Fourier modes (and internal indices, if there
were any).
Then,
%
\begin{align}
\partial_t \Gamma_k[\phi_{\mathrm cl}]=&
\partial_t W_k[J]-\partial_t \Delta S_k[\phi_{\mathrm cl}]=\notag\\
&=\frac12\mathrm{Tr}(\langle\phi\phi\rangle-\langle\phi\rangle\langle\phi\rangle)\partial_t R_k\notag\\
&=-\frac12\mathrm{Tr}\frac{\delta^2 W_k}{\delta J\delta J}\partial_t R_k.
\end{align}
%
Applying the standard identity
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta^2 W_k}{\delta J\delta J}=
-\left(\frac{\delta^2\tilde\Gamma_k}{\delta\phi_{cl}\delta\phi_{cl}}\right)^{-1},
\end{equation}
%
one then obtains the ERGE \cite{Wetterich:2001kr}
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ERGE}
\partial_t\Gamma_k=
{1\over2}\mathrm{Tr}\left({\delta^2\Gamma_k\over\delta\phi\delta\phi}+R_k\right)^{-1}
\partial_tR_k.
\end{equation}
%
In the previous formula and in the following we shall drop the subscript in $\phi_{cl}$;
this should not cause any confusion.
The ERGE describes the flow of the functional $\Gamma_k$ with the scale $k$.
In order to extract beta functions, one has to resort to approximations.
A common procedure is to make an Ansatz about the form of $\Gamma_k$
and to insert it into the ERGE. 
Of course the beta functions obtained in this way are no longer exact:
one loses all information about the dependence of the beta functions 
on the parameters that have been left out of the Ansatz.
Nevertheless, the results do contain information that is not accessible
in perturbation theory and they have been shown to yield numerically 
accurate values in many circumstances \cite{Bagnuls:2000ae,Bonanno:2000sy}.
We now apply this procedure to the scalar theory.

Introducing in equation \eqref{eq:ERGE} the truncation
\mbox{$\Gamma_k(\phi)=\int d^4x \left[-\frac12\phi\partial^2\phi+V(\phi^2)\right]$},
where $V$ is a $k$-dependent potential, gives
\begin{equation}
\partial_t\Gamma_k=
{1\over2}\mathrm{Tr}\left(
{\partial_tP_k\over
P_k+V'+4\phi^2V''}
\right).
\end{equation}
where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to $\phi^2$,
the trace can be understood as an integration over momenta.
It can be reexpressed as:

\begin{equation}
\partial_t\Gamma_k=
{\mathit{Vol}\over 32\pi^2}\tilde Q_2\left({\partial_tP_k\over
P_k+V'+4\phi^2V''}\right)
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathit{Vol}=\int d^4x$ denotes the volume of spacetime and
\begin{equation}
\tilde Q_n[f]=\frac1{\Gamma(n)}\int_0^{+\infty}\mathrm{d}z\,z^{n-1}f(z).
\end{equation}
%
The coupling constants can be extracted from the potential by
\begin{equation}
\tilde\lambda_{2n}=
{1\over n!}{\partial^n V\over\partial (\phi^2)^n}\Big|_{\phi=0}\ .
\end{equation}
In order to look for a fixed point one has to
define dimensionless couplings
$\lambda_{2n}=k^{2(n-2)}\tilde\lambda_{2n}$.
The corresponding beta functions are given by
%
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \lambda_{2n}=
2(n-2)\lambda_{2n}+{k^{2(n-2)}\over Vol}{1\over n!}
{\partial^n\over\partial (\phi^2)^n}\partial_t \Gamma_k \Big|_{\phi=0}.
\end{equation}
%
Explicitly, the first few beta functions are given by
%
\begin{widetext} 
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:scalar.beta.functions}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:beta.lambda2}
