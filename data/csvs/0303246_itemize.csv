\item V is in the cohomology of the BRST operator $Q$, that is:
\begin{equation*}
 \{Q,V\} = 0, \qquad V \ne Q \Lambda.
\end{equation*}
Note that $V$ and $\Lambda$ are fields in the small Hilbert space
(which does not contain $\xi$ zero modes). \item Each vertex V
comes from a definite GSO sector, either GSO$(+)$ or GSO$(-)$. The
former being $NS+$ (fermionic) and $R+$ (bosonic), the latter
being $NS-$ (bosonic) and $R-$ (fermionic). \item The vertex V
must have ghost number $+1$. \item V must have a definite picture.
Usually the picture is chosen to be $-1$ for the $NS+$ sector and
$-\frac{1}{2}$ for the $R+$ sector.

\item We should consider vertices in the large Hilbert space,
$\Phi=\xi V$. For these kind of vertices the BRST condition of the
RNS translates to:
\begin{equation*}
G^+ \tilde G^+ \Phi =0, \qquad \Phi\ne G^+ \Lambda + \tilde G^+
\tilde \Lambda.
\end{equation*}
These are also the linearized equations of motion coming from the
superstring field theory action. \item Again the vertices come
from one of the two GSO sectors, but their statistics are now
reversed with respect to the RNS. \item Ghost charge is the $U(1)$
charge of the $N=4$ formalism, and we should demand  all the
vertices to have zero ghost charge. \item Choosing a picture in a
RNS formalism is the responsible for the lack of manifest
supersymmetry. In the hybrid variables we may choose the values of
the $\rho$ charge instead. We choose $\rho$ charge zero for the
four-dimensional fields and $\rho$-charge $\pm1$ for the internal
6-dimensional fields. Another equivalent possibility is to choose
the value of the C-charge (defined in eq.(\ref{c-charge}) to have
one of three values in the set $\{-1/3,0,1/3\}$.
