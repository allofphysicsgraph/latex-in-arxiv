The quantum instability of the Savvidy-Nielsen-Olesen (SNO)
vacuum of the one-loop effective action of $SU(2)$ QCD 
is due to the lack of gauge invariance.
We  prove that the gauge invariance, in particular 
the color reflection invariance, 
restores the stability of the SNO vacuum, and thus 
guarantees the stability of the magnetic condensation in QCD.
