{\bf 2.} Similarly, we now treat the transformation of the 
free-field action $S_b$
under the $3D$ conformal group $\mbox{\sl Conf\/}(3)$, whose Lie algebra 
generators are listed in section 3. Recalling the transformation of the field 
$\psi$ from section 2, and setting $x=1/2$, the action changes into
$S_b \mapsto S_b^{'} = S_b + \delta S_b$ where
\BEA
\delta_X S_b &=& \int \!\D\zeta'\,\D t'\, \D r'\: \frac{1}{2} {r'}^2\, 
\left\{ \beta(t'), t'\right\} 
\left(\frac{\partial\psi'}{\partial \zeta'}\right)^2
\nonumber \\
\delta_Y S_b &=& \int \!\D\zeta'\,\D t'\, \D r'\:  \left(
\alpha(t') - 2 r'\right) \ddot{\alpha}(t') 
\left(\frac{\partial\psi'}{\partial \zeta'}\right)^2
\label{4:gl:Sb_trans}
\EEA
It is also esay to see that $\delta S=0$ under the other generators of
${\mathfrak{conf}}_3$. This means that $S_b$ is
invariant under the $3D$ conformal group, in agreement with 
the conclusion drawn in section 3 from the infinitesimal transformations. 

As before, we now discuss the Ward identities. To straighten notation, we
construct a vector $\vec{\xi}$ with components
\BEQ
\xi_{-1} = \zeta \;\; , \;\; \xi_0=t \;\; , \;\; \xi_1 = r_1 \;\;
,\;\; \ldots\;\; ,\;\; \xi_d = r_d
\EEQ
and write the derivatives $\partial^{\mu}\psi=\partial\psi/\partial\xi_{\mu}$. 
Under an infinitesimal transformation 
$\vec{\xi}\mapsto\vec{\xi}'=\vec{\xi}+\vec{\eps}(\vec{\xi})$, the 
action is assumed to transform to leading order as
\BEQ \label{4:gl:Wardz}
\delta S = \int \!\D\zeta\D t\D\vec{r}\: T_{\mu}^{\nu} \partial^{\mu}
\eps_{\nu}
\EEQ
and we proceed to write down the Ward identities, restricting to $d=1$ for
simplicity.  Again, $S$ is 
translation-invariant par construction. Dilatation invariance implies
\BEQ \label{4:gl:Wz1}
2 T_{0}^{0} + T_{1}^{1} = 0
\EEQ
Invariance of $S$ under the three generators $N$, $Y_{1/2}$ and 
${V}_{-}$ coming from the $3D$ conformal rotations (see section 3)
yields the following Ward identities, respectively
\BEQ \label{4:gl:Wz2}
T_{-1}^{-1} - T_{0}^{0} = 0 \;\; , \;\;
T_{0}^{1} - \II T_{1}^{-1} = 0 \;\; , \;\;
T_{-1}^{1} -\II T_{1}^{0} = 0 
\EEQ
and it follows that $T$ has 5 independent components. Next, we consider 
the three remaining generators $X_1$, $W$ and $V_+$ which come
from the $3D$ special conformal transformations. The components of 
$\eps_{\nu}$ are easily read from the generators and we have
\BEA
\delta_{X_{1}}S &=& -\eps \int\!\D\zeta\D t\D r\: 
\left[ \left(2T_{0}^{0}+T_{1}^{1}\right) t + 
\left(T_{0}^{1}-\II T_{1}^{-1}\right) r \right] = 0
\nonumber \\
\delta_{W}S &=& -\eps \int\!\D\zeta\D t\D r\: 
\left[ \left(2T_{-1}^{-1}+T_{1}^{1}\right) \zeta + 
\left(T_{-1}^{1}-\II T_{1}^{0}\right) r \right] = 0
\nonumber \\
\delta_{V_+}S &=& -\eps \int\!\D\zeta\D t\D r\: 
\left[ \left(T_{-1}^{-1}+T_{0}^{0}+T_{1}^{1}\right) r + 
\left(T_{0}^{1}-\II T_{1}^{-1}\right) \II\zeta + 
\left(T_{-1}^{1}-\II T_{1}^{0}\right) \II t \right] = 0
\label{4:gl:WardXWV}
\EEA
This merely translates the well-known result of 
conformal invariance, namely 
that translation, rotation and scale invariance 
imply full conformal invariance
\cite{Call70,diFr97,Henk99}, to the formulation at hand. Furthermore,
considering the transformation of $S$ under the 
infinitesimal action of the generators
$X$ and $Y$ of the extended Schr\""odinger algebra, we read off $\eps_{\nu}$
from the Fourier transform of (\ref{4:gl:eps}) and find
\BEQ 
\delta_{X(\eps)} S = \frac{\II}{4}\int\!\D\zeta\D t\D r\:
r^2\,T_{0}^{-1}\,\dddot{\eps}
\;\; , \;\;
\delta_{Y(\eps)} S = {\II}\int\!\D\zeta\D t\D r\:r\,T_{0}^{-1}\,\ddot{\eps}
\EEQ
As before, we can compare this with the infinitesimal form of the
transformation of the free-field action $S_b$ in eq.~(\ref{4:gl:Sb_trans})
and identify
\BEQ \label{4:gl:T0-1}
T_{0}^{-1} = 2\II \left( \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\zeta}\right)^2
\EEQ
which is the analogue of eq.~(\ref{4:gl:V0}). 

Therefore, the current $J_0$ or the component $T_{0}^{-1}$, respectively, 
generate the change of the action under an infinitesimal extended Schr\""odinger
transformation. We point out that in $2D$ conformally invariant classical
field theories, no such term is present. Namely, the conformal generators
$\ell_n = - z^{n+1}\partial_z$ and $\overline{\ell}_n = - \overline{z}^{n+1}
\partial_{\overline{z}}$ with $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ can be rewritten as
$X_n = \ell_n + \overline{\ell}_n$ and $Y_n = -\II(\ell_n - \overline{\ell}_n)$
where the `time' $t$ and `space' $r$ were introduced from the complex
coordinates $z,\overline{z}$ via $z=t+\II r, \overline{z}=t-\II r$. The
projective conformal Ward identities $T_{00}+T_{11}=0$ and $T_{01}=T_{10}$
follow as usual. Discarding any conformal anomalies, these identities 
are sufficient to show that $\delta_{X_n} S = \delta_{Y_n} S =0$ 
for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. 



We finish by constructing the energy-momentum tensor explicitly. 
The canonical energy-momentum tensor is given by 
\BEQ
\wit{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}=-\delta_{\mu}^{\nu} {\cal L}_b +{\partial {\cal L}_b
\over \partial (\partial^{\mu}\psi)} \partial^{\nu} \psi.
\EEQ
and may be written in a matrix form (here for the $d=1$ case, where $\nu$ 
labels the columns and we write 
$\psi_{\zeta}=\partial\psi/\partial\zeta,\ldots$)
\BEQ
\wit{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 
-\psi_r^2 & 2\II\psi_t^2 & 2\II\psi_r \psi_t \\
2\II\psi_{\zeta}^2 & -\psi_r^2 & 2\II\psi_{\zeta}\psi_r \\
2\psi_r \psi_{\zeta} & 2\psi_r \psi_t & \psi_r^2 -2\II\psi_{\zeta}\psi_t
\end{array}\right).
\EEQ
It reproduces (\ref{4:gl:T0-1}), is classically conserved and satisfies 
all Ward identities  (\ref{4:gl:Wz2}) coming from the $3D$ conformal group, 
but not scaling identity eq.~(\ref{4:gl:Wz1}). To correct this,
define the improved tensor \cite{Call70}
\BEQ
T_{\mu}^{\nu}=\wit{T}_{\mu}^{\nu}+\partial^{\rho} B_{\rho \mu}^{\nu},
\EEQ
with $B_{\rho \mu}^{\nu}$  antisymmetric in $\rho$ in $\mu$, which has
the same divergence as $\wit{T}$. Choosing 
\BEQ
B_{-1 0}^{\nu}=\left(\begin{array}{c} -{\II\over 2} \psi\psi_{\zeta} \\
{\II\over 2} \psi\psi_t \\ 0 \end{array}\right),
B_{1 0}^{\nu}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ {1\over 2}\psi\psi_r \\-{\II\over 2}
\psi\psi_{\zeta} \end{array}\right),
B_{1 -1}^{\nu}=\left(\begin{array}{c} {1\over 2} \psi\psi_r \\ 0\\-{\II\over 2}
\psi\psi_t \end{array}\right),
\EEQ
the improved energy-momentum tensor reads (where the equations of motion
were used)  
\BEQ
T_{\mu}^{\nu} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
{\II}\psi_{\zeta}\psi_t-\II\psi\psi_{\zeta t} -\psi_r^2 &
  {3}\II\psi_t^2-{\II}\psi\psi_{tt} & 
  {\II}[3\psi_t \psi_r-\psi\psi_{tr}] \\
3{\II} \psi_{\zeta}^2 -{\II}\psi\psi_{\zeta\zeta} & 
{\II}\psi_{\zeta}\psi_t -\II\psi\psi_{\zeta t} -\psi_r^2
   & {\II}[3 \psi_{\zeta}\psi_r -\psi\psi_{\zeta r}] \\
{3}\psi_{\zeta}\psi_r - \psi\psi_{\zeta r} & 
  {3}\psi_t \psi_r-\psi\psi_{t r} &
-2[\II\psi_{\zeta}\psi_t -\II\psi\psi_{\zeta t} -\psi_r^2]  
\end{array} \right) .
\EEQ
which manifestly satisfies the conditions eqs.~(\ref{4:gl:Wz1},\ref{4:gl:Wz2})
and is conserved. Of course, this is just a
particular case of the construction of the Belinfante tensor in $3D$ conformal 
theory (see \cite{Call70,diFr97}). As pointed out long ago \cite{Call70}, the
consideration of the improved energy-momentum tensor in Poincar\'e-invariant
interacting theories is of particular interest, since satisfying the
conformal Ward identities implies that the elements of $T_{\mu}^{\nu}$ remain
finite in the limit of a large cut-off for renormalizable interactions. 
Their result should translate, through the inclusion of ${\mathfrak
{sch}}_d$ into ${\mathfrak{conf}}_{d+2}$  described in section 3, to 
non-relativistic interacting theories and one should be able to avoid this
way difficulties \cite{Hage72a} with the finiteness of the elements of 
$T_{\mu\nu}$ which may arise in Galilei-invariant field theories with 
fixed masses. 


{\bf 3.} Having studied so far the full 
conformal algebra $(\mathfrak{conf}_3)_{\C}$,
we now consider its subalgebras. In particular, we inquire about the status
of the Ward identities for the subalgebras $\mathfrak{sch}_1$ and
$\mathfrak{age}_1$. 

We consider first the free-field action $S_b$, formulated in terms of scaling
operators $\psi=\psi(\zeta,t,r)$. From eq.~(\ref{4:gl:WardXWV}) it is clear 
that the Ward identities coming from dilatation and Galilei invariance are
sufficient to prove also special Schr\""odinger invariance, i.e.
$\delta_{X_1} S=0$. The question raised is thus settled for $\mathfrak{sch}_1$. 

A new aspect arises, however, for  $\mathfrak{age}_1$. In that case, time
translation invariance is no longer assumed, but all elements of 
$\mathfrak{age}_1$ keep the line $t=0$ invariant. Consequently, the 
transformation (\ref{4:gl:Wardz})  of the action under infinitesimal 
transformations might be generalized to
\BEQ \label{4:gl:29}
\delta S = \int \!\D\zeta\D t\D\vec{r}\: T_{\mu}^{\nu} \partial^{\mu}
\eps_{\nu} + \int_{(t=0)} \!\!\!\D\zeta\D\vec{r}\: U^{\nu}\eps_{\nu}
\EEQ
where the second integral is restricted to the `boundary' $t=0$. 

Then, and now specializing to $d=1$, 
translation invariance in $r$ and in $\zeta$ yields $U^{1}=U^{-1}=0$.
Although $U^0$ is not fixed, it does not contribute to $\delta S$, since
$\eps_0=0$ at $t=0$ for all elements of $\mathfrak{age}_1$. From dilatation and
Galilei invariance, the Ward identities $T_0^0 + \frac{1}{2} T_1^1=0$ and
$T_0^{1}-\II T_1^{-1}=0$ follow and consequently for a special 
Schr\""odinger transformation generated by $X_{1}$, we have
\BEQ
\delta_{X_1} S = -\eps \int\!\D\zeta\D t\D r\: \left[ 
\left( 2 T_0^0 + T_1^1\right) t + \left( T_0^1 -\II T_1^{-1}\right)r\right]
+\frac{\II\eps}{2} \int_{(t=0)} \!\D\zeta\D r\: r^2 U^{-1} = 0
\EEQ
This means that the validity of special Schr\""odinger invariance mainly
depends on having a $z=2$ scale invariance and Galilei invariance, while
time-translation invariance is not really required. 

Similarly, if we had chosen instead to work with a fixed mass ${\cal M}$, the
transformation (\ref{4:gl:Wardm}) of the action should be generalized 
as follows
\BEQ \label{4:gl:31}
\delta S = \int\!\D t\,\D\vec{r}\: \left( T_{\mu\nu}\partial_{\mu}\eps_{\nu}
+ J_{\mu} \partial_{\mu} \eta \right) 
+\int_{(t=0)} \!\!\!\D\vec{r}\: \left( U_{\nu} \eps_{\nu} + V \eta \right)
\EEQ
and it is now straightforward to see that again special Schr\""odinger invariance
$\delta_{X_1}S=0$ follows. Note that it follows in particular form phase-shift 
invariance that $V$ should be $0$.

Our result is that special Schr\""odinger invariance holds as a consequence of
scale and Galilei invariance, even in the absence of time-translation 
invariance, provided only that the dynamics is `local' in the 
sense of eqs.~(\ref{4:gl:29}) or (\ref{4:gl:31}). It is well-known that
ageing ferromagnets undergoing phase-ordering 
kinetics after being quenched to a fixed temperature $T$ below criticality 
is scale invariant with a dynamical exponent $z=2$ \cite{Bray94}. If we
accept that these systems are also Galilei-invariant, we can conclude
that these coarsening systems must also be invariant under special
Schr\""odinger transformations. This explains
{\em why} special Schr\""odinger invariance could be successfully
tested in these systems, see \cite{Henk01,Godr02,Pico02,Henk02a,Henk02b}.

Having described the relationship between conformal and Schr\""odinger
transformations, we now discuss the consequences for the two- and three-point
functions. Let $\Psi_a(\vec{\xi}_a)=\psi_a(\zeta_a,t_a,\vec{r}_a)$
be a scalar and quasi-primary conformal scaling operators with scaling 
dimension $x_a$. We can always take the $\Psi_a$ to be real. 
It is well-known that \cite{Poly70}
\BEA
\lefteqn{
\left\langle \psi_1(\zeta_1,t_1,\vec{r}_1)
\psi_2(\zeta_2,t_2,\vec{r}_2)\right\rangle =
\left\langle \Psi_1(\vec{\xi}_1) \Psi_2(\vec{\xi}_2) \right\rangle =
\Psi_0 \delta_{x_1,x_2}\, |\vec{\xi}_1-\vec{\xi}_2|^{-2x_1} 
} 
\nonumber \\
&=& \psi_0 \delta_{x_1,x_2}\, (t_1-t_2)^{-x_1} 
\left( \zeta_1-\zeta_2+{\II\over 2} {(\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2)^2\over
t_1-t_2}\right)^{-x_1}
\label{5:gl:1} 
\EEA
where $\psi_0 = 4^{-x_1}\Psi_0$ and $\Psi_0$ is a normalization constant. 
In order to understand the physical meaning of the result (\ref{5:gl:1}), 
we rewrite it in terms of scaling operators $\phi_a(t,r)$
with fixed mass ${\cal M}_a\ge 0$, using eq.~(\ref{2:gl:phipsi}). 
As shown in appendix B, we find, provided $x_1>0$
\BEA
\left\langle \phi_1(t_1,\vec{r}_1)
\phi_2^*(t_2,\vec{r}_2)\right\rangle &=& {1\over 2\pi}
\int_{\R^2} \!\D\zeta_1 \D\zeta_2\: 
e^{-\II{\cal M}_1\zeta_1+\II{\cal M}_2\zeta_2}
\left\langle \psi_1(\zeta_1,t_1,\vec{r}_1)
\psi_2(\zeta_2,t_2,\vec{r}_2)\right\rangle 
\label{5:gl:2} \\
&=& \phi_0\, \delta_{x_1,x_2}\, 
\delta({\cal M}_1-{\cal M}_2)\, {\cal M}_1^{1-x_1}\: 
\Theta(t_1-t_2)  (t_1-t_2)^{-x_1} \exp\left(-\frac{{\cal M}_1}{2}
\frac{(\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2)^2}{t_1-t_2}\right)
\nonumber 
\EEA
where $\phi_0$ is again a normalization constant (proportional to $\psi_0$) 
and $\Theta$ is the Heaviside
function. The functional form of $\langle\phi\phi^*\rangle$ 
had been derived before from the requirement that it transform covariantly 
under the realization of the Schr\""odinger group {\sl Sch}($d$) with fixed
masses \cite{Henk94}. We stress that the causal
prefactor $\Theta(t_1-t_2)$ is {\it not} a consequence of covariance under that
realization, but rather had to be put in by hand \cite{Henk94} 
to comply with the requirement that 
$\langle \phi_1 \phi_2^*\rangle$ should decay to zero for large distances 
$r=|\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2|$. Furthermore, 
causality as implied in (\ref{5:gl:2}) fits perfectly with the 
interpretation of $\langle \phi \phi^*\rangle=\langle \phi \wit{\phi}\rangle$ 
as response function in the context of Martin-Siggia-Rose theory \cite{Mart73} 
and suggests the identification of the complex conjugate scaling 
operator $\phi^*$ with the response operator $\wit{\phi}$, 
conjugate to the order parameter scaling operator $\phi$. 

An analogous result holds for three-point functions. Recall the well-known
result of conformal invariance \cite{Poly70}
\BEQ \label{5:gl:3}
\left\langle \Psi_1(\vec{\xi}_1) \Psi_2(\vec{\xi}_2) \Psi_3(\vec{\xi}_3)
\right\rangle
= C_{123}\, |\vec{\xi}_1-\vec{\xi}_2|^{-x_{12,3}}\:
|\vec{\xi}_2-\vec{\xi}_3|^{-x_{23,1}}\:|\vec{\xi}_3-\vec{\xi}_1|^{-x_{31,2}} 
\EEQ
where $x_{ab,c}:=x_a+x_b-x_c$ and $C_{123}$ is an operator product expansion
(OPE) coefficient. As shown in appendix B we find, provided
$x_1>0$ and $x_2>0$
\BEA
\lefteqn{
\left\langle \phi_1(t_1,\vec{r}_1)\phi_2(t_2,\vec{r}_2)
\phi_3^*(t_3,\vec{r}_3)\right\rangle
= {\cal C}_{12,3}\, \delta({\cal M}_1+{\cal M}_2 - {\cal M}_3)\: 
}
\nonumber \\
&\times& \Theta(t_1-t_3)\, \Theta(t_2-t_3)\:  
(t_1-t_2)^{-x_{12,3}/2}\,(t_1-t_3)^{-x_{13,2}/2}\,
(t_2-t_3)^{-x_{23,1}/2} 
\label{5:gl:3P} \\ 
&\times& \exp\left[ -\frac{{\cal M}_1}{2} 
\frac{(\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_3)^2}{t_1-t_3}
-\frac{{\cal M}_2}{2} \frac{(\vec{r}_2-\vec{r}_3)^2}{t_2-t_3} \right]
\Phi_{12,3} \left( \frac{1}{2} 
\frac{[(\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_3)(t_2-t_3)-
(\vec{r}_2-\vec{r}_3)(t_1-t_3)]^2}{(t_1-t_2)(t_2-t_3)(t_1-t_3)}
\right)
\nonumber 
\EEA
where ${\cal C}_{12,3}$ is a constant related to the OPE coefficient
$C_{123}$ and $\Phi_{12,3}(v)$ is a scaling function (see eq.~(\ref{B:eq:11})
for an integral representation). As we had seen before for
the two-point function, the functional form of this result is in complete
agreement with the one found previously from Schr\""odinger invariance alone
for scaling operators $\phi_a$ with fixed masses 
${\cal M}_a\geq 0$ \cite{Henk94}. However, the causality conditions
$t_1>t_3$ and $t_2>t_3$ expected for a response function are now
automatically satisfied and need no longer be put in by hand. The conditions
on the masses in (\ref{5:gl:2},\ref{5:gl:3P}) 
are nothing but examples of the standard Bargmann superselection rules. 

In summary, we have seen how to reconstruct the physically more appealing
expectation values $\langle\phi\phi^*\rangle$ and
$\langle\phi\phi\phi^*\rangle$ from their conformal
forms as given by $\langle\psi\psi\rangle$, $\langle\psi\psi\psi\rangle$,
where we have used right away the forms (\ref{5:gl:1},\ref{5:gl:3}) 
which follow from covariance under the full 
conformal algebra $(\mathfrak{conf}_3)_{\C}$. 
We now ask to what extent the form
of the two-point function is already determined by one of the subalgebras
as obtained in section 3. 

In order to do so, we shall begin by deriving the constraints on the
two-point function (for simplicity in $d=1$ dimensions)
\BEQ
F = \left\langle \psi_1(\zeta_1,t_1,r_1)\psi_2(\zeta_2,t_2,r_2)\right\rangle
\EEQ
coming from its invariance under the minimal parabolic subalgebra 
$\wit{\mathfrak{age}}_1=\{X_{0,1}, Y_{\pm 1/2}, M_0, N\}$. It is convenient
to introduce the variables $u=t_1-t_2$ and $v=t_1/t_2$. From space and phase
translation invariance, we have $F=F(\zeta,u,v,r)$, where
$\zeta=\zeta_1-\zeta_2$ and $r=r_1-r_2$. Next, the covariance conditions
yield the following equations
\BEA
X_0 F &=& \left( - u \partial_u - \frac{1}{2} r \partial_r - \frac{x_1+x_2}{2}
\right) F = 0 
\nonumber \\
Y_{1/2} F &=& \left( - u \partial_r + \II r \partial_{\zeta} \right) F = 0 
\nonumber \\
N F &=& \left( -u \partial_u + \zeta \partial_{\zeta} \right) F = 0 
\label{5:gl:XYNXcov} \\
X_1 F &=& \left( - u^2 \partial_u - u v \partial_v - u r \partial_r
 +\frac{\II}{2} r^2
\partial_{\zeta} - u x_1 \right) F = 0
\nonumber 
\EEA
Using the first and second of these again, the last condition
$X_1F=0$ simplifies into
\BEQ \label{5:gl:X1cov}
\left( - v \partial_v + \frac{x_2-x_1}{2} \right) F = 0
\EEQ
Therefore, we have the factorization $F=F_0(v) F_1(\zeta,u,r)$, where
$F_1$ satisfies the same conditions found in the time-translation invariant
case. We easily find
\BEQ \label{5:gl:psiuv}
\left\langle \psi_1(\zeta_1,t_1,r_1)
\psi_2(\zeta_2,t_2,r_2)\right\rangle 
= \psi_0 \left( \frac{t_1}{t_2}\right)^{(x_2-x_1)/2}\, 
\left(t_1-t_2\right)^{-(x_1+x_2)/2}\, 
\left( \zeta_1-\zeta_2+{\II\over 2} 
{(r_1-r_2)^2\over t_1-t_2}\right)^{-(x_1+x_2)/2}
\EEQ
with some normalization constant $\psi_0$. Comparing with  the conformal 
result eq.~(\ref{5:gl:1}), we observe the absence of the constraint $x_1=x_2$
on the scaling dimensions and the presence of a factor  which explicitly
breaks time-translation invariance. 

If we had merely required invariance under a proper subalgebra of 
the minimal parabolic subalgebra $\wit{\mathfrak{age}}_1$, we would not have had
sufficiently many conditions in order to fix the two-point function completely.
However, if we restrict ourselves to $\mathfrak{age}_1$ by leaving out only the 
generator $N$, although the two-point function 
$\langle\psi\psi\rangle=t^{-x_1}E(\zeta+\II r^2/2t)$ then contains the 
undetermined scaling function $E$, the form of the response function
$\langle\phi\phi^*\rangle=\phi_0 t^{-x_1}\exp(-r^2/(2{\cal M}_1 t))$
is still completely fixed, up to a mass-dependent normalization constant
$\phi_0=\phi_0({\cal M}_1)$. 

Next, we consider the extension of $\wit{\mathfrak{age}}_1$ to one of the 
two maximal parabolic subalgebras of ${\mathfrak{conf}}_3$ studied in
section 3 and in appendix~C.
First, we consider $\wit{\mathfrak{sch}}_1$ 
by adding the generator $X_{-1}$ of time translations. 
This simply enforces $x_1=x_2$ and
we recover the conformal result (\ref{5:gl:1}). Second, we consider
$\wit{\mathfrak{alt}}_1$ by adding the generator $V_+$. We obtain

V_+ F &=& \left( - 2 u r \partial_u - 2 v r\partial_v - 
2 \zeta r \partial_{\zeta}
-(r^2+2\II\zeta u)\partial_r - 2 r x_1 - 2t_2\left( r\partial_u +\II \zeta
 \partial_r \right)
\right) F \nonumber \\
&=& -2u(v-1)^{-1}\left( r\partial_u +\II \zeta \partial_r\right) F 
\EEA
and where in the second line the covariance conditions 
eqs.~(\ref{5:gl:XYNXcov},\ref{5:gl:X1cov}) were used. From (\ref{5:gl:psiuv})
it can be seen that indeed $V_+F=0$ and the two-point function transforms
covariantly under $\wit{\mathfrak{alt}}_1$. In this case, there is no
constraint on $x_1$ and $x_2$.

The case of an arbitrary space dimension $d$ is treated in the same way
by simply replacing the $r_a$ by $\vec{r}_a$. 
In conclusion, we have found two distinct forms of the two-point function, 
namely (\ref{5:gl:1}) and (\ref{5:gl:psiuv}). 
The form of the two-point function is completely fixed if the symmetry
algebra contains $\wit{\mathfrak{age}}$. 
If in addition the dynamic symmetry algebra contains the extended 
Schr\""odinger algebra $\wit{\mathfrak{sch}}$, 
the two-point function $\langle\psi\psi\rangle$ 
reduces to the form (\ref{5:gl:1}) as obtained from full conformal invariance
or, alternatively, the causal form $\langle\phi\phi^*\rangle$ of
eq.~(\ref{5:gl:2}). On the other hand, if time-translation invariance is
absent, the algebra of dynamical symmetries may be given by
$\wit{\mathfrak{alt}}$ or $\wit{\mathfrak{age}}$ and the two-point function
is given by (\ref{5:gl:psiuv}). The causal form with fixed masses is then
given by, provided $x_1+x_2>0$ 
\BEA
\lefteqn{ 
\left\langle \phi_1(t_1,\vec{r}_1)\phi_2^*(t_2,\vec{r}_2)\right\rangle = 
\phi_0\, \delta({\cal M}_1-{\cal M}_2)\, {\cal M}_1^{1-(x_1+x_2)/2}\: 
}
\nonumber \\
&\times& \Theta(t_1-t_2)  \left(\frac{t_1}{t_2}\right)^{(x_2-x_1)/2} 
(t_1-t_2)^{-(x_1+x_2)/2} \exp\left(-\frac{{\cal M}_1}{2}
\frac{(\vec{r}_1-\vec{r}_2)^2}{t_1-t_2}\right)
\label{5:gl:2A}
\EEA
This form for the response function $R(t,s;\vec{r})
=\langle\phi(t;\vec{r})\wit{\phi}(s;\vec{0})\rangle=
\langle\phi(t;\vec{r})\phi^*(s;\vec{0})\rangle$, including the
causality condition $t>s$, has been confirmed
in ageing phenomena in several models of simple ferromagnets quenched to a 
temperature $T<T_c$ below criticality, in particular the
$2D$ and $3D$ Glauber-Ising model \cite{Henk01,Henk02a,Henk02b}, the
spherical model with a non-conserved order parameter 
\cite{Cala02,Cann01,Godr00b,Henk01,Pico02} and, last but not least, the
free random walk \cite{Cugl94}.

\section{Conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our study of Schr\""odinger invariance as a dynamical space-time symmetry was
motivated by the known explicit confirmation of some of its consequences in a 
few specific and non-trivial models. In order to understand better the origin 
of such a symmetry, a useful starting point is the analysis of the associated
classical free-field theory of which the Schr\""odinger equation is the
Euler-Lagrange equation of motion. Going through this exercise, 
it became apparent to us that the mass $\cal M$ in this 
equation should be considered as a dynamical
variable on the same level as space and time coordinates. This leads us to
the following results: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the usual projective representation of the Schr\""odinger group becomes
a true representation, via conjugation by Fourier transformation with
respect to $\cal M$.
\item  a new relation between the Schr\""odinger Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sch}_d$ 
and the complexified conformal Lie algebra $(\mathfrak{conf}_{d+2})_{\C}$ is
found, namely
\BEQ
\mathfrak{sch}_d \subset (\mathfrak{conf}_{d+2})_{\C}
\EEQ
Some subalgebras of 
$(\mathfrak{conf}_{d+2})_{\C}$ closely related to parabolic subalgebras may
play a r\^ole in physical applications, notably to ageing phenomena in
spin systems. We leave the elaboration of this to future work. 

We also reconsidered an old claim \cite{Baru73} that $\mathfrak{sch}_d$ could
be obtained as a non-relativistic limit from a conformal Lie algebra. 
If the mass $\cal M$ is treated as a dynamic variable from the
beginning, we find in the non-relativistic limit $c\to\infty$ instead 
$(\mathfrak{conf}_{3})_{\C}\to\wit{\mathfrak{alt}}_1\ne\mathfrak{sch}_1$. 
\item the Ward identities which express the invariance of an action under 
conformal transformations, or merely under the Schr\""odinger subalgebra
$\mathfrak{sch}_d$ or else $\mathfrak{age}$, are derived from the `locality
assumption' eqs.~(\ref{4:gl:29}) or (\ref{4:gl:31}). An important open
question is the extension of $\mathfrak{sch}_d$ to an  
infinite-dimensional algebra - possibly ${\cal S}_1^{\infty}$ or
natural extensions thereof to $d$
spatial dimensions - such as to include those 
terms which would describe the contributions of anomalies coming from quantum 
fluctuations. In order to prepare such a study, 
we explicitly constructed the conserved
energy-momentum tensor (and also the probability current) which satisfy these
Schr\""odinger (or conformal) Ward identities. 
Further work along these lines is in progress. 

When applying these considerations to ageing, we must take into account that
time-translation invariance does no longer hold. This can be dealt with 
by allowing for a `boundary term' in the action and coming from the
$t=0$ initial conditions. Schematically, we have  
\BEQ
\left. \begin{array}{c}
\mbox{\rm spatial translation invariance} \\
\mbox{\rm phase shift invariance}\\
\mbox{\rm Galilei invariance} \\
\mbox{\rm scale invariance with $z=2$} \\
\mbox{\rm locality}
\end{array} \right\}"
