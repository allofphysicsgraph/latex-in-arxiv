\caption{Part of a spatial lattice.  A typical link $l$ and plaquette $P$
are illustrated.  A magnetic monopole and its Dirac string are shown,
hidden between the sites of the lattice.}

\caption{Two D-branes (the vertical planes) and a cylindrical string
world-sheet with one boundary on each D-brane.  The world-sheet can be
regarded either as an open string with one end on each D-brane (the dotted
line) traveling in a vacuum loop, or a closed string (the dashed line)
emitted by one D-brane and absorbed by the other.}
