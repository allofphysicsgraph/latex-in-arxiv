A consistent physical theory of quantum mechanics can be built on
a complex Hamiltonian that is not Hermitian but instead satisfies
the physical condition of space-time reflection symmetry (${\cal
PT}$ symmetry). Thus, there are infinitely many new Hamiltonians
that one can construct that might explain experimental data. One
would think that a quantum theory based on a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian violates unitarity. However, if ${\cal PT}$ symmetry
is not broken, it is possible to use a previously unnoticed
physical symmetry of the Hamiltonian to construct an inner product
whose associated norm is positive definite. This construction is
general and works for any ${\cal PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian. The
dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. This formulation
does not conflict with the requirements of conventional quantum
mechanics. There are many possible observable and experimental
consequences of extending quantum mechanics into the complex
domain, both in particle physics and in solid state physics.
