In the present talk I shall review the construction
of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity models exhibiting stable de Sitter vacua.
These solutions represent the first instance of stable backgrounds with positive cosmological constant in the framework of extended supergravities ($\mathcal{N}\ge 2$). After briefly reviewing the role of de Sitter space--times in inflationary cosmology, I shall describe the main ingredients which were necessary for the construction of gauged $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity models admitting stable solutions of this kind.
