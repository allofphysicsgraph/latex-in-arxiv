Focusing on gauge degrees of freedom specified by a 1+3 dimensions model
hosting a Maxwell term plus a Lorentz and CPT non-invariant
Chern-Simons-like contribution, we obtain a minimal extension of such a
system to a supersymmetric environment. We comment on resulting peculiar
self-couplings for the gauge sector, as well as on background contribution
for gaugino masses. Furthermore, a non-polynomial generalization is
presented.
