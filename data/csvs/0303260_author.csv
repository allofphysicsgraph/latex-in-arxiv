  We investigate the breakdown of supersymmetry at finite temperature.
  While it has been proven that temperature always breaks
  supersymmetry, the nature of this breaking is less clear. On the one
  hand, a study of the Ward-Takahashi identities suggests a
  spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry without the existence of a
  Goldstino, while on the other hand it has been shown that in any
  supersymmetric plasma there should exist a massless fermionic
  collective excitation, the phonino.  Aim of this work is to unify
  these two approaches. For the Wess-Zumino model, it is shown that
  the phonino exists and contributes to the supersymmetric
  Ward-Takahashi identities in the right way displaying that
  supersymmetry is broken spontaneously with the phonino as the
  Goldstone fermion.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Supersymmetry has become a central element in the extensions of the
standard model of elementary particle physics that currently attract
most attention.  It is not only an intriguing mathematical concept
with a distinct importance for theoretical physics as the only
nontrivial extension of the Poincar\'e algebra in relativistic quantum
field theory, but it has some very attractive properties also from the
point of view of phenomenology.

On the other hand, our insight into the evolution of the universe has
made an enormous progress over the last decades, and there has been a
stimulating interchange of ideas between cosmology and quantum field
theory. Of particular importance is the behaviour of symmetries in a
hot plasma like it is believed to have existed shortly after the big
bang, since phase transitions may have left their traces in the
present state of the universe. For example, it is well-known that the
spontaneously broken gauge symmetry of the standard model is restored
at high temperature, a phenomenon that appears quite generally for
global and gauge symmetries. So, if we believe that supersymmetry was
realized in the hot early stages of the universe in one or the other
way, it is indispensable to understand its behaviour at high
temperatures.

Considering the fact that this is such a fundamental problem, it is
astonishing how little has been done to solve it. Although it was
realized that supersymmetry generally breaks down at finite
temperature already in the earliest works on the
subject~\cite{Das:rx,Girardello:1980vv}, the subsequent literature
contains many contradictory statements, and our understanding of the
mechanism of supersymmetry breaking at finite temperature is still
unsatisfactory.

The current status can be summarized as follows. Only recently, it has
been rigorously proven that supersymmetry is always broken at any
finite temperature~\cite{Buchholz:1997mf}. In fact, this is not
surprising, as in thermal field theory the ground state is described
by a statistical ensemble with different populations of bosons and
fermions.  Since the thermal ground state is responsible for the
breakdown of supersymmetry, it has much in common with a spontaneous
breaking.  Thus, a natural question to ask is whether it is associated
with the existence of a massless Goldstone fermion.  The investigation
of the supersymmetric Ward-Takahashi
identities~\cite{Boyanovsky:1983tu,Matsumoto:im} showed that there
must be a zero-energy Goldstone mode.  However, since the rest frame
of the heat bath also breaks Lorentz invariance, this mode is not
necessarily associated with a propagating Goldstone particle.
Nevertheless, in~\cite{Lebedev:rz} (clarifying earlier ideas
in~\cite{Gudmundsdottir:1986uq}) it has been shown from a
complementary point of view that any model with thermally broken
supersymmetry should contain a massless fermionic collective
excitation, similar to the appearance of sound waves in a medium with
spontaneously broken Lorentz invariance. The associated particle was
baptized phonino because of its similarity to the phonon.  For the
simple case of the Wess-Zumino model, the existence of this phonino
was proved.

In this work, we will again focus on the Wess-Zumino model. Though it
appears relatively simple and has already been investigated in a
number of papers, it reveals a very interesting structure. Our aim is
to unify the different results in the literature and to obtain a
complete picture of the breakdown of supersymmetry in this model. To
this end, we will give an explicit proof of the existence of the
phonino and investigate its contributions to the Ward-Takahashi
identities of broken supersymmetry.  It turns out that supersymmetry
is indeed broken spontaneously by the heat bath with the phonino
playing the role of the Goldstone particle.  The results obtained for
the Wess-Zumino model allow us to infer the behaviour of more general
models.

The paper is organized as follows. After briefly reviewing the
theoretical framework and the Wess-Zumino model in
sections~\ref{sec:tft} and~\ref{sec:model}, the established knowledge
about supersymmetry and one-loop behaviour of the Wess-Zumino model
will be presented and partly extended for our purposes in
sections~\ref{sec:susy} and~\ref{sec:loop}.  In
section~\ref{sec:phonino}, we present a full calculation of the
fermion propagator for low momenta and give an explicit proof of the
existence of the phonino.  Finally, section~\ref{sec:wti} is devoted
to the investigation of the Ward-Takahashi identities.

%=============THERMAL FIELD THEORY=================================
\section{Thermal field theory}
\label{sec:tft}

We will work in the framework of finite temperature field theory which
is the appropriate formalism for the description of quantum fields in
thermal equilibrium. The thermal background will be described by the
canonical ensemble with a density matrix
\[  \rho=Z^{-1}\mathrm{e}^{-\beta H}. \]
Here, $H$ is the Hamiltonian, and the inverse temperature
\mbox{$\beta=(k_\mathrm{B} T)^{-1}$} is chosen in units so that
Boltzmann's constant is unity.  The partition function $Z$ normalizes
the density operator so that the expectation value of an
observable~$\mathcal{O}$ is given by
\[   \langle \mathcal{O}\rangle_\beta= \tr \rho\mathcal{O}. \]

The basic effect of the presence of the thermal background on free
quantum fields is a modification of the propagators. Since
annihilation operators do not annihilate the thermal ground state, the
propagator of a scalar field $A$ gets an additional thermal
contribution. It reads
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:propagator}
 D(p)=\ensuremath{\int\! \mathrm{d}^4 x}\, \mathrm{e}^{ip(x-y)}\langle T A(x)A(y)\rangle_\beta=
 \frac{i}{p^2-m^2+i\epsilon}+2\pi\,\delta(p^2-m^2)\,\ensuremath{n_\mathrm{B}(p_0)},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \ensuremath{n_\mathrm{B}(p_0)}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^{\beta |p_0|}-1}
\end{equation}
is the Bose-Einstein distribution function.  Analogously, the free
fermion propagator is given by
\begin{equation}
  S(p)=\ensuremath{\int\! \mathrm{d}^4 x}\, \mathrm{e}^{ip(x-y)}\langle T \Psi(x)"
