We consider the one-loop renormalization of dimension four
composite operators and the energy-momentum tensor
in noncommutative $\phi^4$ scalar field theory.
Proper operator bases are
constructed and it is proved that the bare
composite operators are expressed via renormalized ones, with the
help of a mixing matrix, whose explicit form is calculated.
The corresponding matrix elements turn out to differ from the
commutative theory.
The canonically defined energy-momentum tensor is not finite and
must be replaced by the ""improved"" one, in order to provide finiteness.
The suitable ""improving"" terms are found.
