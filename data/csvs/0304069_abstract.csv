  We look at some dynamic geometries produced by scalar fields
  with both the ``right"" and the ``wrong"" sign of the kinetic
  energy.  We start with anisotropic homogeneous universes with
  closed, open and flat spatial sections. A non-singular solution
  to the Einstein field equations representing an open anisotropic
  universe with the ghost field is found. This universe starts
  collapsing from $t \to -\infty$ and then expands to $t \to
  \infty$ without encountering singularities on its way. We
  further generalize these solutions to those describing
  inhomogeneous evolution of the ghost fields. Some interesting
  solutions with the plane symmetry are discussed. These have a
  property that the same line element solves the Einstein field
  equations in two mirror regions $\left|t\right|\geq z$ and
  $\left|t\right|\leq z$, but in one region the solution has the
  \emph{right} and in the other, the \emph{wrong} signs of the
  kinetic energy. We argue, however, that a physical observer can
  not reach the mirror region in a finite proper time.
  Self-similar collapse/expansion of these fields are also briefly
  discussed.
