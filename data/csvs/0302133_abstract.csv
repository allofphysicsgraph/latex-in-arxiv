A superstring action is quantised with Neveu Schwarz(NS) and Ramond(R) boundary conditions. 
The zero mass states of the NS sector are classified as the vector gluons, W-mesons,
$B_{\mu}$-mesons and scalars containing Higgs. The fifteen zero mass fermions are obtained 
from the Ramond sector. A space time supersymmetric Hamiltonian of the Standard Model is
presented without any conventional SUSY particles.
