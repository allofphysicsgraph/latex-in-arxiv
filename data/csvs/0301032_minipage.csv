{\small
We review the construction of chiral four-dimensional compactifications of 
type IIA string theory with intersecting D6-branes. Such models lead to 
four-dimensional theories with non-abelian gauge interactions and charged 
chiral fermions. We discuss the application of these techniques to 
building of models with spectrum as close as possible to the Standard 
Model, and review their main phenomenological properties. We also 
emphasize the advantages/disadvantages of carrying out this idea
using supersymmetric of non-supersymmetric models.}
