Charged particles in static electric and magnetic fields have Landau levels
and, in the Coulomb gauge, tunneling states from vacuum. 
Using the instanton method of Phys. Rev. D {\bf 65}, 105002 (2002), 
we obtain new formulae for
the pair-production rate in spinor and scalar QED, which sum over all Landau 
levels. The new formulae not only recover exactly the well-known results but 
also give rise to other expressions more rapidly converging 
in the strong electric field limit.
