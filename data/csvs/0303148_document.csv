{\bf Abstract.}
Though a Chern--Simons $(2k-1)$-form is not gauge-invariant and it
depends on a background connection, this form seen as a 
Lagrangian of gauge theory on 
a $(2k-1)$-dimensional manifold leads to the energy-momentum conservation 
law.

The local Chern--Simons (henceforth CS) form seen as a Lagrangian of
the gauge theory on a 3-dimensional manifold is well known to lead
to the local conservation law of the canonical energy-momentum tensor.
Generalizing this result, we show that a global higher-dimensional 
CS gauge theory admits
an energy-momentum conservation law in spite of the fact that its
Lagrangian depends on a background gauge potential and that one can not
ignore its gauge non-invariance. The CS
gravitation theory here is not considered (e.g., \cite{al,bor2}).

We derive Lagrangian energy-momentum
conservation laws from the first variational formula (e.g.,
\cite{book,book00,sard97,epr,epr1}). Let us consider a first order
field theory on a fibre bundle $Y\to X$ over an $n$-dimensional base $X$.
Its Lagrangian is defined as a density $L={\cal L} d^nx$ on the first order
jet manifold $J^1Y$ of sections of $Y\to X$. 
Given bundle coordinates $(x^\lambda,y^i)$ on a fibre bundle $Y\to
X$, its first and second order jet manifolds $J^1Y$ and 
$J^2Y$ are equipped with the
adapted coordinates $(x^\lambda,y^i,y^i_\mu)$ and $(x^\lambda,y^i,y^i_\mu,
y^i_{\lambda\mu})$, respectively. 
We will use the notation $\omega=d^nx$ and
$\omega_\lambda=\partial_\lambda\rfloor \omega$.

Given a Lagrangian 
$L$
on $J^1Y$, the corresponding Euler--Lagrange operator reads"
