\caption[NB-IV]{Imaginary and real parts
from variational perturbation theory
of 16th order $D_{\rm var}^{(16)}(g)$ as a function of $\log{g}$
(dots)
in comparison with exact curves (curves).
In the imaginary part
we have removed
the leading
essential singularity
by dividing out a  factor  $\exp{(-1/4g)}$
to see the amazing accuracy
with which this singularity is approximated. For very small $g$ the
onset of oscillations in the imaginary part can be seen
which moves
towards the origin for increasing order
$L$ of the variational approximation.

\caption[I]{Logarithm of
 the imaginary part of
 the ground state energy of
 the anharmonic oscillator with the essential singularity
factored out for better visualization,
$
l(g)=\log\left[ {\sqrt{-\pi g/2}~E_{0,\rm var}^{(64)}(g)}\right] -1/3g$,
plotted against
 small negative values of
 the coupling constant $-0.2<g<-.006$
where the series is
 Borel-nonsummable.
The thin curve represents
the divergent expansion around an instanton
of Ref.~\cite{ZINNJ}.
The fat curve is the
 $22$nd order approximation of the
 strong-coupling expansion,
 analytically continued
to negative $g$ in the sliding regime calculated
 in
Chapter 17 of the textbook \cite{Hagen}.
