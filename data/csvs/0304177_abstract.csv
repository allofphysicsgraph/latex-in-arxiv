We study compactifications of Einstein gravity on product spaces
in vacuum and their acceleration phases.  Scalar potentials for
the dimensionally reduced effective theory are found to be of
exponential form and exact solutions are obtained for a class of
product spaces.  The inflation in our solutions is not sufficient
for the early universe.  We comment on the possibility of
obtaining sufficient inflation by compactification in general.
