The notion of Galois currents in Rational Conformal Field Theory is
introduced and illustrated on simple examples. This leads to a natural
partition of all theories into two classes, depending on the existence
of a non-trivial Galois current. As an application, the projective
kernel of a RCFT, i.e. the set of all modular transformations represented
by scalar multiples of the identity, is described in terms of a small
set of easily computable invariants.
