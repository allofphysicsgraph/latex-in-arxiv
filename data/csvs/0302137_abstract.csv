\textit{We analyze the classical stability of string cosmologies driven by the dynamics of
orientifold planes. These models are related to time--dependent orbifolds, and resolve
the orbifold singularities which are otherwise problematic by introducing orientifold planes.
In particular, we show that the instability discussed by Horowitz and Polchinski
for pure orbifold models is resolved by the presence of
the orientifolds. Moreover, we discuss the issue of stability of the
cosmological Cauchy horizon, and we show that it is stable to small perturbations
due to in--falling matter.}
