In this article we construct the chirality and 
Dirac operators on noncommutative $AdS_2$.     
We also derive the discrete spectrum of the Dirac operator which  is 
important in the study of the spectral triple associated to $AdS_2$. It is shown that 
the degeneracy of the spectrum present in the commutative $AdS_2$ is lifted 
in the noncommutative case. The way we construct the 
chirality operator is suggestive of how to introduce the projector operators 
of the corresponding projective modules on this space.
