We study the mutual consistency of twisted boundary conditions
in the coset conformal field theory $G/H$.
We calculate the overlap of the twisted boundary states of $G/H$
with the untwisted ones, and show that the twisted boundary states
are consistently defined in the diagonal modular invariant.
The overlap of the twisted boundary states is expressed by
the branching functions of a twisted affine Lie algebra.
As a check of our argument, we study the diagonal coset theory
$so(2n)_1 \oplus so(2n)_1/so(2n)_2$, which is equivalent
with the orbifold $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$.
We construct the boundary states twisted by the automorphisms
of the unextended Dynkin diagram of $so(2n)$, and
show their mutual consistency by identifying their counterpart
in the orbifold.
For the triality of $so(8)$, the twisted states of the coset
theory correspond to neither the Neumann nor the Dirichlet
boundary states of the orbifold and yield the conformal boundary states
that preserve only the Virasoro algebra.
