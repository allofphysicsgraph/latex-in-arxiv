Though this equation is similar to (\re{gybe}),
the  commutation of the transfer matrices ensuring  the integrability 
of the systems through factorization of the trace identity
 becomes problematic due to the presence of $Z$-matrix.
Detail discussion of this problem and the classification of the $Z$-matrices 
allowing factorization    is given  in \c{hlavkun96}.
Investigations of some nonultralocal systems from  a different

in \c{reshet}.
It is easy to see that from

\subsection {List of quantum integrable nonultralocal  models}
 Nonultralocal
 models are mostly nonfundamental systems with infinite dimensional 
representations defined  in some  Hilbert space.
They may correspond to 
  integrable models with spectral parameter dependent
 Lax operator and $R(\la)$-matrix or may describe only 
nonultralocal algebras   having
spectral parameterless $L$-operator  and  
$R(\la)_{\la \to + \infty} \to R^+_q $-matrix.  
Nevertheless the nonultralocal  quantum  models listed below 
should be   
described  through the same braided relations 
 (\re{zlzl1u},\re{bqybel},\re{bqybeg}) or their corresponding 
spectral-less form in a systematic way.
 Therefore we 
 present only   the  explicit form  
  of their  braiding matrix 
 $ Z$   and the $L$ operator, indicating  the class of  $R$-matrix they
belong to. These inputs should be enough to obtain 
all individual  equations and derive the related results.

\ni {\bf I. Systems with spectral parameterless $R$-matrix} 
\\ 
\ni  1. {\it Current algebra in WZWN model} \c{wzwn}
 
The model involves   the nonultralocal current algebra
\be \{L_1(x),L_2(y)\}= \frac {\gamma} {2} [C,L_1(x)-L_2(y)]\delta(x-y)
+ \gamma C \delta'(x-y) \ll{current}\ee
with $C_{12}= 2P_{12}-1$, where $P_{12} $ is the permutation operator, 
$L= \frac {1} {2} (J_0+J_1)$ with $J_\mu= \partial_\mu gg^{-1},$
is the  current and $g \in SU(N)$ the chiral field. 
Discretized and quantum version of this  algebra may be cast
 as the spectral-free limit of the above   braided YBE 
relations with
$R^+_q$ as the R-matrix, current $L$ as the Lax operator  
  and  $Z_{12}=R_{q21}^+$ as the braiding matrix, which takes the form
\begin{equation}
{R}^+_{q21}L_{1j}L_{2j}
= L_{2j} L_{1j}{R}^+_{q12}, \ \ L_{1j} L_{2j+1} = L_{2j+1}({R}^+_{q12})^{-1}
 L_{1j} 
\ll{wzwn}\end{equation}
For the details and an interesting quantum group relation of this model
the readers are refered to   the original works \c{wzwn}.
\\  2. {\it Coulomb gas picture of  CFT}  \c{babelon}

The Drinfeld-Sokolov linear problem : $ Q_x={\cal L}(x)Q$   
describing this system  may be given
 in the simplest case by the linear
operator $ {\cal L}(x)= v(x) \si ^3 - \si ^+ $ with a nonultralocal property
due to current-like relation ~$ \{ v(x) , v(y) \}= \delta'(x-y). $
Discretized and quantized forms
of the current-like operator defined through the commutation relations
\be
[v^\pm_k, v^\pm_l] = \pm i {\al \ov 2} (\delta_{k,l+1}- \delta_{k+1,l}),
\ \ 
%\nonumber \ll{cr1}\ee \be
[v^+_k, v^-_l] =i {\al \ov 2} (\delta_{k+1,l}-
2\delta_{k,l}+\delta_{k,l+1})
\ll{cr12}\ee
construct the corresponding discretized linear operator as 
$~~ L_k=e^{-i v^-_k\si ^3} + \Delta e^{i v^+_k} \si^+ ,
%\ll{coulomb}\ee
~~$, which  
similar to the above case satisfies  the  spectral-free    braided
YBE and other relations with $R^+_q$ as  $R$ and $Z=
q^{- \si ^3 
\otimes \si ^3}
$ as the braiding matrix. Generalization of this model 
for $SU(N)$ has also been 
constructed  similarly in   \c{babelon}.
 \\
\ni {\bf II. Models with rational  $R(\la)$-matrix}
\\
\ni 3. {\it Nonabelian Toda chain }  \c{natoda}

 The Lax operator of the model  given by
\be
L_{k}(\lambda) = \left( \begin{array}{c}
\lambda - A_k
\qquad  \ \ -B_{k-1}
 \\ I
\qquad \ 0
         \end{array}   \right), \ \ A_k=\dot{g}_k g_k^{-1},
 \ \  B_k= g_{k+1}
 g_k^{-1}, \ g_k \in SU(N), 
\ll{Lkor}\ee
represents nonultralocal integrable model and solves all braided relations 
including the BQYBE with spectral dependent 
 rational  
$~R(\lambda)= P-ih \lambda I$ and  the  braiding
matrix  $Z_{12}=
 {\bf 1} + i { h }(
 e_{22}\otimes e_{12}) \pi, $
where $P$ and $ \pi$ are permutation operators. For further details on this
model including its gauge relation with an ultralocal model we refer to the
original work   \c{natoda}.
\\  4. {\it Nonultralocal quantum mapping }\c{Nijhof}

The system is  
described by the  Lax operator
$L_n=V_{2n}V_{2n-1}$, with 
$ V_{n}=\lambda_n \sigma^- +\sigma^++ \ha v_{n} (1+\sigma^3),$
where  the  discretized operator  $ v_k \equiv v^-_k$
involves  nonultralocal algebra (\re{cr12}) and  
yields at the continuum limit  $\Delta \to 0$ 
 the current-like field: 
$v_k \to i \Delta  v(x)$. 
This nonultralocal quantum integrable 
model satisfies again 
  integrable braided  relations 
with  spectral-dependent
 rational $R(\la_1-\la_2)$-matrix  similar to  the above case but now
 with a spectral  dependent braiding matrix
 $\  \ Z_{12}(\la_2)= { I}- \frac { h }{\la_2}\sigma^{-
}\otimes \sigma^{+} \ \ $ and $Z_{21}(\la_1). $ For generalization of this
model to higher  rank groups and other details we refer again to the
original work  \c{Nijhof}.
\\ 
\ni {\bf III. Models with trigonometric $R(\la)$-matrix} 
\\
\ni 5. {\it Quantum mKdV model  }  \c{kmpl95}

 
This well known  nonultralocal model may
 be raised to the quantum level with discrete 
Lax operator
\be
L_{k}(\xi) = \left( \begin{array}{c}
(W_k^{-})^{-1}
\qquad  \ \
 i\De \xi W_k^{+}\\
-i\De \xi (W_k^{+})^{-1}
\qquad \ W_k^{-}
         \end{array}   \right),
\ll{Lmkdv}\ee
where $ W_{j}^{\pm}=e^{iv_{j}^{\pm} } $ with $v^\pm_k$ obeying the 
 nonultralocal 
 relations like (\re{cr12}).
  $R$-matrix (\re{trm}) and the braiding matrix
$ Z_{12}=  Z_{21}= q^{-\frac {1}{2} \sigma^3\otimes \sigma^3
}$ are associated with  this  nonultralocal integrable system 
\c{kmpl95}. Bethe ansatz 
solution  of quantum mKdV and its generalizations can be found in detail in
 \c{fr02}. It is seen easily that one  can recover the well known Lax
operator of the mKdV field model: $  U(x,\xi)={i \ov 2} (iv(x) \sigma^3
+\xi \sigma ^2)$  from (\re{Lmkdv}) at the field limit when $v^{\mp}_k \to 
\sqrt \mp  \Delta  v(x)$, as $L_k= {\rm I} + \Delta  U(x,\xi) + O (\Delta ^2)$. 
\\
\ni 6. {\it Quantum light-cone sine-Gordon  model } 

It is known that 
this well known equation : $ \partial^2_{+-}u=2\sin2 u$ may be represented 
by the 
zero curvature condition: \  $ 
\partial_- {\rm {U}}_+ -\partial_+ {\rm {U}}_+ + [ {\rm {U}}_+,
 {\rm {U}}_-]=0$ 
 of the 
 Lax pair ${\rm {U}}_\pm $ with 
$ {\rm {U}}_-(x) 
=
{i \ov 2} \partial_- u(x) \si ^3 +    
   \xi ( e^{-i  u (x)} \si ^+ +  
     e^{i  u (x)} \si ^-)
$ and similarly for ${\rm {U}}_+(x)$. Recently  quantum as well as  
exact lattice versions of the nonultralocal 
 Lax operator have been constructed \c{kun02}, which in particular for 
${\rm {U}}_-(x)$  may be given  in the form
\be
L^{(-)lcsg}_j{(\la)} =
% \left( \begin{array}{c}
   e^{i(p_j-\al \nabla u_j)\si ^3} + 
  \Delta \xi \left ( e^{-i(p_j+\al  u_{j+1})} \si ^+
    + e^{i(p_j+\al  u_{j+1})} \si ^- \right ) 
, \quad \nabla u_j \equiv  u_{j+1}- u_{j}. 
\ll{lcsg}\ee 
It may be shown also that (\re{lcsg}) 
  obeys exactly  the above BQYBE and the braiding
relation with the trigonometric 
$R$-matrix (\re{trm}) and the braiding
matrix 
$ Z_{12}^{(-)}=e^{i \al \sigma^3 \otimes \sigma^3} $,  and consequently
represent a genuine quantum integrable nonultralocal model. 



Some other nonultralocal models known in the literature need
 introduction of braiding beyond 
NN, basic formulation of which can be found in \c{hlavqb,hlavkun96}.
 Examples of   
such models having same 
 braiding between any two different sites are
i.) {\it Integrable model on moduli space }  \c{alex},
ii.) {\it Supersymmetric models } \c{SUSY,hlavkun96}, 
iii. ) {\it Braided  algebra}  \c{majid}, iv) 
NUL extension of YBE \c{exybe}
 etc. Their unified description 
can be found  in \c{hlavkun96,review}. 

\subsection{Algebraic Bethe ansatz}

The solution of the eigenvalue problem for  integrable
nonultralocal models by diagonalizing
  the transfer matrix may  be
formulated through algebraic Bethe ansatz 
    exactly in analogy with the ultralocal models, whenever the
factorization of the trace problem, as mentioned above, could be resolved.
 The key equation that is to  be  used  
for nonultralocal models for finding the commutation
relations analogous to  (\re{db}) in the ABA scheme     
 should naturally be given by BQYBE (\re{bqybeg}). We however 
 skip all details of this
ABA formulation 
for nonultralocal models, which can be found in   explicit form on the example of 
 the
nonultralocal 
quantum mKdV model in  \c{kmpl95,fr02}.
\subsection{Open  directions in nonultralocal models}

Since some of the  nonultralocal models like nonabelian
Toda chain, WZWN current algebra, mKdV etc. described above can be connected 
to ultralocal models through operator dependent local gauge transformation,
it would be challenging to discover similar relation, if any,
for  the rest of the quantum integrable  nonultralocal models \c{kun02}.

Other challenging problems  undoubtedly are the possible 
 quantum integrable 
formulation of the famous nonultralocal models like nonlinear $\si$-model,
complex sine-Gordon model, derivative NLS equation etc.   through braided YBE. 
     
  
As we know, there is a  remarkable interconnection between the integrable
quantum and statistical models. However this connection is discovered until
now only for the ultralocal models as we have also seen here.
 Therefore it should be 
a new direction of study  to investigate
 whether there could be any meaningful statistical model corresponding to
the integrable nonultralocal models described here.


Another problem worth looking into would be to formulate  fundamental 
nonultralocal models, if any,
 which then could be used possibly for generalizing   spin and
electron models with  nonultralocality.

Anyway since this vast branch of integrable systems has received
significantly
insufficient attention, we may hope to have many hidden excitements 
in this area.


\section {Concluding remarks}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
Quantum 
integrable systems can be divided into two broad classes, ultralocal (UL) and
nonultralocal (NUL). We have presented here a brief description 
 of such models 
with references for further details and 
  demonstrated that the models  belonging to both
these classes 
 can be described systematically through a set of algebraic
 relations signifying integrability of these systems. For UL models
 these relations are the ultralocality
condition and the QYBE involving Lax operator
 $L$ and the $R$ -matrix, while for
NUL models they are extended to braiding relation and braided QYBE with an 
additional entry of braiding matrix $Z$. The $L$ operator
representing an individual model is naturally model dependent and
the same seems to be
true also for the $Z$ matrix. The $R$-matrix on the other hand is mainly of
two types (elliptic case is not considered here),
 trigonometric and rational depending on the class of models
that are associated with q-deformed and undeformed algebras, respectively.
 This 
induces   a significantly model-independent  approach
also in the ABA method for solving the eigenvalue problem.
For UL systems, the theory of which is  more developed, 
 one can go beyond  and prescribe  an unifying algebraic scheme  for  
  generating   individual Lax operators 
 realized from  a single ancestor model in a systematic way.
It would be a challenge to extend the formulation of 
this scheme also for the NUL models.
The integrable statistical vertex models can be related to the corresponding 
quantum models, which as a rule belong to UL systems. Possible 
systematic extension of
such relation to NUL systems would be another challenging problem.

Though this equation is similar to (\re{gybe}),
the  commutation of the transfer matrices ensuring  the integrability

\subsection {List of quantum integrable nonultralocal  models}
 Nonultralocal
 models are mostly nonfundamental systems with infinite dimensional 
representations defined  in some  Hilbert space.
They may correspond to 
  integrable models with spectral parameter dependent
 Lax operator and $R(\la)$-matrix or may describe only 
nonultralocal algebras   having
spectral parameterless $L$-operator  and  
$R(\la)_{\la \to + \infty} \to R^+_q $-matrix.  
Nevertheless the nonultralocal  quantum  models listed below 
should be   
described  through the same braided relations 
 (\re{zlzl1u},\re{bqybel},\re{bqybeg}) or their corresponding 
spectral-less form in a systematic way.
 Therefore we 
 present only   the  explicit form  
  of their  braiding matrix 
 $ Z$   and the $L$ operator, indicating  the class of  $R$-matrix they
belong to. These inputs should be enough to obtain 
all individual  equations and derive the related results.

\ni {\bf I. Systems with spectral parameterless $R$-matrix} 
\\ 
\ni  1. {\it Current algebra in WZWN model} \c{wzwn}
 
The model involves   the nonultralocal current algebra
\be \{L_1(x),L_2(y)\}= \frac {\gamma} {2} [C,L_1(x)-L_2(y)]\delta(x-y)
+ \gamma C \delta'(x-y) \ll{current}\ee
with $C_{12}= 2P_{12}-1$, where $P_{12} $ is the permutation operator, 
$L= \frac {1} {2} (J_0+J_1)$ with $J_\mu= \partial_\mu gg^{-1},$
is the  current and $g \in SU(N)$ the chiral field. 
Discretized and quantum version of this  algebra may be cast
 as the spectral-free limit of the above   braided YBE 
relations with
$R^+_q$ as the R-matrix, current $L$ as the Lax operator  
  and  $Z_{12}=R_{q21}^+$ as the braiding matrix, which takes the form
\begin{equation}
{R}^+_{q21}L_{1j}L_{2j}
= L_{2j} L_{1j}{R}^+_{q12}, \ \ L_{1j} L_{2j+1} = L_{2j+1}({R}^+_{q12})^{-1}
 L_{1j} 
\ll{wzwn}\end{equation}
For the details and an interesting quantum group relation of this model
the readers are refered to   the original works \c{wzwn}.
\\  2. {\it Coulomb gas picture of  CFT}  \c{babelon}

The Drinfeld-Sokolov linear problem : $ Q_x={\cal L}(x)Q$   
describing this system  may be given
 in the simplest case by the linear
operator $ {\cal L}(x)= v(x) \si ^3 - \si ^+ $ with a nonultralocal property
due to current-like relation ~$ \{ v(x) , v(y) \}= \delta'(x-y). $
Discretized and quantized forms
of the current-like operator defined through the commutation relations
\be
[v^\pm_k, v^\pm_l] = \pm i {\al \ov 2} (\delta_{k,l+1}- \delta_{k+1,l}),
\ \ 
%\nonumber \ll{cr1}\ee \be
[v^+_k, v^-_l] =i {\al \ov 2} (\delta_{k+1,l}-
2\delta_{k,l}+\delta_{k,l+1})

construct the corresponding discretized linear operator as 
$~~ L_k=e^{-i v^-_k\si ^3} + \Delta e^{i v^+_k} \si^+ ,
%\ll{coulomb}\ee
~~$, which  
similar to the above case satisfies  the  spectral-free    braided
YBE and other relations with $R^+_q$ as  $R$ and $Z=
q^{- \si ^3 
\otimes \si ^3}
$ as the braiding matrix. Generalization of this model 
for $SU(N)$ has also been 
constructed  similarly in   \c{babelon}.
 \\
\ni {\bf II. Models with rational  $R(\la)$-matrix}
\\
\ni 3. {\it Nonabelian Toda chain }  \c{natoda}

 The Lax operator of the model  given by
\be
L_{k}(\lambda) = \left( \begin{array}{c}
\lambda - A_k
\qquad  \ \ -B_{k-1}
 \\ I
\qquad \ 0
         \end{array}   \right), \ \ A_k=\dot{g}_k g_k^{-1},
 \ \  B_k= g_{k+1}
 g_k^{-1}, \ g_k \in SU(N), 
\ll{Lkor}\ee
represents nonultralocal integrable model and solves all braided relations 
including the BQYBE with spectral dependent 
 rational  
$~R(\lambda)= P-ih \lambda I$ and  the  braiding
matrix  $Z_{12}=
 {\bf 1} + i { h }(
 e_{22}\otimes e_{12}) \pi, $
where $P$ and $ \pi$ are permutation operators. For further details on this
model including its gauge relation with an ultralocal model we refer to the
original work   \c{natoda}.
\\  4. {\it Nonultralocal quantum mapping }\c{Nijhof}

The system is  
described by the  Lax operator
$L_n=V_{2n}V_{2n-1}$, with 
$ V_{n}=\lambda_n \sigma^- +\sigma^++ \ha v_{n} (1+\sigma^3),$
where  the  discretized operator  $ v_k \equiv v^-_k$
involves  nonultralocal algebra (\re{cr12}) and  
yields at the continuum limit  $\Delta \to 0$ 
 the current-like field: 
$v_k \to i \Delta  v(x)$. 
This nonultralocal quantum integrable 
model satisfies again 
  integrable braided  relations 
with  spectral-dependent
 rational $R(\la_1-\la_2)$-matrix  similar to  the above case but now
 with a spectral  dependent braiding matrix
 $\  \ Z_{12}(\la_2)= { I}- \frac { h }{\la_2}\sigma^{-
}\otimes \sigma^{+} \ \ $ and $Z_{21}(\la_1). $ For generalization of this
model to higher  rank groups and other details we refer again to the
original work  \c{Nijhof}.
\\ 
\ni {\bf III. Models with trigonometric $R(\la)$-matrix} 
\\
\ni 5. {\it Quantum mKdV model  }  \c{kmpl95}

 
This well known  nonultralocal model may
 be raised to the quantum level with discrete 
Lax operator
\be
L_{k}(\xi) = \left( \begin{array}{c}
(W_k^{-})^{-1}
\qquad  \ \
 i\De \xi W_k^{+}\\
-i\De \xi (W_k^{+})^{-1}
\qquad \ W_k^{-}
         \end{array}   \right),
\ll{Lmkdv}\ee
where $ W_{j}^{\pm}=e^{iv_{j}^{\pm} } $ with $v^\pm_k$ obeying the 
 nonultralocal 
 relations like (\re{cr12}).
  $R$-matrix (\re{trm}) and the braiding matrix
$ Z_{12}=  Z_{21}= q^{-\frac {1}{2} \sigma^3\otimes \sigma^3
}$ are associated with  this  nonultralocal integrable system 
\c{kmpl95}. Bethe ansatz 
solution  of quantum mKdV and its generalizations can be found in detail in
 \c{fr02}. It is seen easily that one  can recover the well known Lax
operator of the mKdV field model: $  U(x,\xi)={i \ov 2} (iv(x) \sigma^3
+\xi \sigma ^2)$  from (\re{Lmkdv}) at the field limit when $v^{\mp}_k \to 
\sqrt \mp  \Delta  v(x)$, as $L_k= {\rm I} + \Delta  U(x,\xi) + O (\Delta ^2)$. 
\\
\ni 6. {\it Quantum light-cone sine-Gordon  model } 

It is known that 
this well known equation : $ \partial^2_{+-}u=2\sin2 u$ may be represented 
by the 
zero curvature condition: \  $ 
\partial_- {\rm {U}}_+ -\partial_+ {\rm {U}}_+ + [ {\rm {U}}_+,
 {\rm {U}}_-]=0$ 
 of the 
 Lax pair ${\rm {U}}_\pm $ with 
$ {\rm {U}}_-(x) 
=
{i \ov 2} \partial_- u(x) \si ^3 +    
   \xi ( e^{-i  u (x)} \si ^+ +  
     e^{i  u (x)} \si ^-)
$ and similarly for ${\rm {U}}_+(x)$. Recently  quantum as well as  
exact lattice versions of the nonultralocal 
 Lax operator have been constructed \c{kun02}, which in particular for 
${\rm {U}}_-(x)$  may be given  in the form
\be
L^{(-)lcsg}_j{(\la)} =
% \left( \begin{array}{c}
   e^{i(p_j-\al \nabla u_j)\si ^3} + 
  \Delta \xi \left ( e^{-i(p_j+\al  u_{j+1})} \si ^+
    + e^{i(p_j+\al  u_{j+1})} \si ^- \right ) 
, \quad \nabla u_j \equiv  u_{j+1}- u_{j}. 
\ll{lcsg}\ee 
It may be shown also that (\re{lcsg}) 
  obeys exactly  the above BQYBE and the braiding
relation with the trigonometric 
$R$-matrix (\re{trm}) and the braiding
matrix 
$ Z_{12}^{(-)}=e^{i \al \sigma^3 \otimes \sigma^3} $,  and consequently
represent a genuine quantum integrable nonultralocal model. 



Some other nonultralocal models known in the literature need
 introduction of braiding beyond 
NN, basic formulation of which can be found in \c{hlavqb,hlavkun96}.
 Examples of   
such models having same 
 braiding between any two different sites are
i.) {\it Integrable model on moduli space }  \c{alex},
ii.) {\it Supersymmetric models } \c{SUSY,hlavkun96}, 
iii. ) {\it Braided  algebra}  \c{majid}, iv) 
NUL extension of YBE \c{exybe}
 etc. Their unified description 
can be found  in \c{hlavkun96,review}. 

\subsection{Algebraic Bethe ansatz}

The solution of the eigenvalue problem for  integrable
nonultralocal models by diagonalizing
  the transfer matrix may  be
formulated through algebraic Bethe ansatz 
    exactly in analogy with the ultralocal models, whenever the
factorization of the trace problem, as mentioned above, could be resolved.
 The key equation that is to  be  used  
for nonultralocal models for finding the commutation
relations analogous to  (\re{db}) in the ABA scheme     
 should naturally be given by BQYBE (\re{bqybeg}). We however 
 skip all details of this
ABA formulation 
for nonultralocal models, which can be found in   explicit form on the example of 
 the
nonultralocal 
quantum mKdV model in  \c{kmpl95,fr02}.
\subsection{Open  directions in nonultralocal models}

Since some of the  nonultralocal models like nonabelian
Toda chain, WZWN current algebra, mKdV etc. described above can be connected 
to ultralocal models through operator dependent local gauge transformation,
it would be challenging to discover similar relation, if any,
for  the rest of the quantum integrable  nonultralocal models \c{kun02}.

Other challenging problems  undoubtedly are the possible 
 quantum integrable 
formulation of the famous nonultralocal models like nonlinear $\si$-model,
complex sine-Gordon model, derivative NLS equation etc.   through braided YBE. 
     
  
As we know, there is a  remarkable interconnection between the integrable
quantum and statistical models. However this connection is discovered until
now only for the ultralocal models as we have also seen here.
 Therefore it should be 
a new direction of study  to investigate
 whether there could be any meaningful statistical model corresponding to
the integrable nonultralocal models described here.


Another problem worth looking into would be to formulate  fundamental 
nonultralocal models, if any,
 which then could be used possibly for generalizing   spin and
electron models with  nonultralocality.

Anyway since this vast branch of integrable systems has received
significantly
insufficient attention, we may hope to have many hidden excitements 
in this area.


\section {Concluding remarks}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
Quantum 
integrable systems can be divided into two broad classes, ultralocal (UL) and
nonultralocal (NUL). We have presented here a brief description 
 of such models 
with references for further details and 
  demonstrated that the models  belonging to both
these classes 
 can be described systematically through a set of algebraic
 relations signifying integrability of these systems. For UL models
 these relations are the ultralocality
condition and the QYBE involving Lax operator
 $L$ and the $R$ -matrix, while for
NUL models they are extended to braiding relation and braided QYBE with an 
additional entry of braiding matrix $Z$. The $L$ operator
representing an individual model is naturally model dependent and
the same seems to be
true also for the $Z$ matrix. The $R$-matrix on the other hand is mainly of
two types (elliptic case is not considered here),
 trigonometric and rational depending on the class of models
that are associated with q-deformed and undeformed algebras, respectively.
 This 
induces   a significantly model-independent  approach
also in the ABA method for solving the eigenvalue problem.
For UL systems, the theory of which is  more developed, 
 one can go beyond  and prescribe  an unifying algebraic scheme  for  
  generating   individual Lax operators 
 realized from  a single ancestor model in a systematic way.
It would be a challenge to extend the formulation of 
this scheme also for the NUL models.
The integrable statistical vertex models can be related to the corresponding 
quantum models, which as a rule belong to UL systems. Possible 
systematic extension of
such relation to NUL systems would be another challenging problem.

12.) {\it Gaudin model}: It is interesting to see that
just by considering  the constant parameter $l$ in the Lax operator
(\re{dlle}) for the discrete LLE to be site dependent: $l \to l_k$,
  one  recovers the   Lax operator
$ L_k(\la)=I +{1 \ov \la-l_k} \vec s_k \cdot \vec \sigma$  
 for the celebrated Gaudin model, given by the integrable Hamiltonians   
$H_k= \sum_{l \neq k}^N {1 \ov l_k-l_l} (\vec s_k \cdot \vec s_l), \ k=
1,2, \ldots, N$ \c{gaudin}.
 This model is associated also with the rational $r_r$
matrix (\re{rr}).
