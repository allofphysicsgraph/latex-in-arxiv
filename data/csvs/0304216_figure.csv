\caption{Phase space for $(f,l)$.
In the dark grey area ($f^2-3l^2<0$) the total energy of the matter sources 
is negative and therefore it is excluded from the dynamical analysis.
The light grey dotted wedge, defined by the lines $l=-f/3$ and 
$l=-f/\sqrt{3}$, is a region where the smallness of the string coupling 
cannot be guaranteed.
We have plotted the numerical solutions of the equations of motion for 
several values of the physical parameters $c$, the efficiency of the
winding mode decay, and $\gamma$, the parameter characterising the
equation of state of the loops created.
The dashed lines correspond to solutions with $\gamma=0$ whereas the 
dark continuous lines to solutions with $\gamma=1/3$.
In both cases $c$ takes values $(0.1,1.0,10)$ from bottom to top.
For comparison we have also included the solution corresponding
to no winding mode decay $c=0$ (light continuous line).

\caption{Energy profiles for $\gamma = 0$ (top) and $\gamma = 1/3$ 
(bottom). 
In both plots the dark lines correspond to $c=1.0$, the light dashed 
lines to $c=0.1$, and the light continuous line to $c=0$, that is, the
case without winding mode decay (Recall that in this particular case 
$E_l=0$ and then the total energy is equal to $E_w$). 
The curves that asymptotically approach the zero axis represent the
energy of winding modes and the curves starting at zero the energy
of the loops produced.
The curves tracked at late times by the loop energy is the total
energy of the system $E_l+E_w$.
