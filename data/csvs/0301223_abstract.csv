We examine the extent to which the action for the membrane of M-theory 
(the eleven-dimensional construct which underlies and unifies all of 
the known string theories) simplifies in the so-called Open Membrane 
(OM) limit, a limit which lies at the root of the various 
manifestations of noncommutativity in the string context.  In order 
for the discussion to be relatively self-contained, we start out by 
reviewing why the strings of ten-dimensional string theory are in fact 
membranes (M2-branes) living in eleven dimensions.  
After that, we recall the definition of OM theory,  
as well as the arguments showing that it is part of
a larger, eleven-dimensional structure 
known as Galilean or Wrapped M2-brane (WM2) theory.
WM2 theory is a rich theoretical 
construct which is interesting for several reasons, in particular 
because it is essentially a toy model of M-theory.  We then proceed to 
deduce a membrane action for OM/WM2 theory, and spell out its 
implications for the four different types of M2-branes one can 
consider in this setting.  
For two of these types, the action in question can be 
simplified by gauge-fixing to a form which implies a \emph{discrete} 
membrane spectrum.  The boundary conditions for the remaining two 
cases do not allow this same gauge choice, and so their dynamics 
remain to be unraveled.
