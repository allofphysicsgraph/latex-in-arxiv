\Abstract{
We study the classical decay of unstable scalar solitons in
noncommutative field theory in $2+1$ dimensions. This can, but does 
not have to, be viewed as a toy model for the decay of D-branes in 
string theory. In the infinite $\theta$ limit, in which the gradient 
term is absent, there are no propagating modes and the soliton does 
not decay at all. If $\theta$ is large, but finite, the rotationally 
symmetric decay channel can be described as a highly excited nonlinear 
oscillator weakly coupled to a continuum of linear modes. This system 
is closely akin to those studied in the context of discrete breathers. 
We here diagonalize the linear problem and compute the decay rate to 
first order using a version of Fermi's Golden Rule, leaving a more 
rigorous treatment for future work.

\section{Introduction}

Solitons are interesting objects. Originally discovered in experiments on 
shallow water waves one and a half centuries ago, they have since then 
become a rich and fascinating area of theoretical and mathematical study. 
Today, solitons are playing an increasingly important role in modern field 
and string theories.

A general issue in the analysis of solitons is stability, in both the 
dynamical (small perturbations of the initial conditions within a theory), 
and the structural (small deformations of the theory) sense. Stability can 
often be established on the basis of topological properties of the solution, 
or by the integrability of the underlying theory. On the other hand, a 
problem that has attracted much less attention concerns the dynamical long-time 
evolution of decaying, {\it unstable} solitons. The reason is apparently not 
because this question fails to be interesting, but rather because it is hard.

In this paper, we study the decay dynamics of a particularly simple class 
of solitons that were discovered only very recently, coined noncommutative 
solitons \cite{gms}. The corresponding model can be derived from the action 
functional
\begin{equation}
S = \int dx\, dy\, dt\; \Bigl[ {\frac12}(\del_t \Phi)^2 - 
{\frac12}(\nabla\Phi)^2 - V(\Phi) \Bigr] \,,
\eqlabel{action}
\end{equation}
which describes a real scalar field $\Phi(x,y,t)$ in $2+1$ dimensions.
Noncommutativity is introduced in the multiplication rule for $\Phi$,
as we review below. We will only consider space-space noncommutativity
in this paper, governed by a single noncommutativity parameter
$\theta\in[0,\infty)$.

``Noncommutative field theories'' of this kind appear for instance as 
world-volume theories of D-branes in string theory by turning on a large 
Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz B-field. In general, the resulting theory is 
more complicated than \eqref{action}, and will include gauge fields and so 
on, but here, we will restrict ourselves to \eqref{action}. We will not 
indulge here in a general discussion of noncommutative geometry \cite{connes}, 
and its role in modern physics. As starting points for references and 
citations we refer to the short list \cite{witten85,connesbook,matrix,cds,
sewi}, as well as to the reviews \cite{fgr,done,szabo}.

\subsection{Motivation from string theory}

Our interest in this problem arose from recent studies of tachyon 
condensation in string theory, hence let us briefly review this background
motivation here. Tachyon condensation in string theory is formalized 
in Sen's conjectures \cite{sen1,sen2}. Roughly, given a string theory 
background with an unstable D-brane or D-brane system, \ie, given a 
solution of string theory with an open string tachyon, one should look 
for another solution of string theory that is related to the first 
solution by ``tachyon condensation''. This solution corresponds to a 
different background with other branes, and can either be stable or 
contain other tachyons. In bosonic string theory, all D$p$-branes are 
unstable, and open string theory is conjectured to have a solution 
corresponding to the condensation of all these tachyons, characterized 
by:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(S1)] There are no perturbative open string excitations around
this solution, which is hence also known as the ``closed string vacuum of
open string field theory''.
\item[(S2)] The energy difference between the solution with open strings
and the closed string vacuum is exactly equal to the D-brane tension computed
in perturbative string theory.
\end{itemize}
(To avoid confusion, we note that the bosonic string in $26$ dimensions also 
has a tachyon in the closed string sector, whose role is, however, much less 
understood.)

A useful analogy in this context is to think of D-branes as 
``tachyonic solitons''. For example, a codimension-one brane in bosonic 
string theory is analogous to the solitonic lump solution in a scalar 
$\phi^3$ theory. This soliton and the D-brane are of course unstable. 
In superstring theory, a codimension-one brane is analogous to the stable 
solitonic kink in a scalar field theory with a $\phi^4$ double-well 
potential. The topological charge of such a soliton that guarantees 
stability is analogous to the Ramond-Ramond charge of a brane. These 
analogies break down at some level because string field theory contains 
many more fields than just the tachyon, and they are all excited in the 
vacua representing the endpoint of tachyon condensation. 

Tachyon condensation can be formulated on the worldsheet (as worldsheet 
RG flow) or in spacetime in open string field theory \cite{senzwi}. This 
has been quite successful and can be regarded as one of the major 
advances in the field over the last few years. Until recently, however, 
the research has focused on finding the endpoint of the condensation, and 
not on the decay of the unstable brane (the condensation of the tachyon) 
as a dynamical process in time.

Very recently, Sen \cite{sen10,sen11,sen12} has made precise proposals
for the construction of the time-dependent solutions corresponding to
the condensation process. This is based mainly on a worldsheet analysis,
and is motivated in part by the S-brane proposal of Gutperle and 
Strominger \cite{gust}. Again, there are many different possible processes
one can study. The generic features characterizing the solutions are
\begin{itemize}
\item[(S3)] If the initial configuration is an unstable brane configuration
of non-zero codimension (say a D$p$-brane in bosonic string theory with
$p<25$) then the energy stays localized in the plane of the original
brane, in other words, energy is not carried away from this plane by
classical radiation.
\item[(S4)] When computing the energy-momentum tensor of the solution
on finds that, asymptotically for late times, the energy density of 
the solution is constant (in the plane of the original brane) and the 
pressure vanishes exponentially in time.
\end{itemize}

It is important to emphasize that these are supposed to be {\it classical} 
solutions of string theory. In particular, the radiation in (S3) are 
open strings. It is very likely that in fact closed strings (which appear 
at one loop level in open string theory) do carry away energy 
\cite{gust,blw,strominger}. Furthermore, one may note that (S3) is in 
some sense a consequence of (S1). Namely, if one thinks of a 
lower-dimensional brane as a tachyonic soliton, then far away this 
solution looks like the closed string vacuum which does not allow 
open string excitations. Hence, there are no modes that could carry 
away energy. Also, (S2) and (S4) are of course partly trivial consequences 
of energy conservation.

All these questions are rather difficult to study in open string field 
theory. The underlying idea behind the present work was to study the 
dynamics of such decays in the so-called noncommutative (NC) field 
theory limit of string theory, in the hope that one could reproduce 
some of the above properties in a simple manner. 

The reason for this hope is the fact that solitons in noncommutative 
field theories (NC solitons) have many properties in common with D-branes 
as tachyonic solitons. NC solitons and instantons in gauge theories 
have been studied independently of strings for quite some time, most 
notably by Nekrasov and Schwarz \cite{nesc}, and more recently by Gross 
and Nekrasov \cite{grne,grne2}, Harvey et al. \cite{hklm}, and others. 
In NC scalar field theories, solitons were discovered by Gopakumar, 
Minwalla and Strominger \cite{gms}. For a summary of the relation to 
D-branes, in particular as far as their charges and descent relations
are concerned, see Harvey's lectures \cite{harvey}.

An explanation of why NC solitons (in the infinite $\theta$ limit)
are useful for describing tachyon condensation in string theory was 
given by Witten \cite{witten73}. The point of \cite{witten73} is that in 
the Seiberg-Witten limit, the open string field algebra factorizes into 
the Moyal algebra built on tachyon vertex operators and another algebra 
that ``contains all the stringy mystifications''. Therefore, in describing 
tachyon condensation, one can concentrate on the tachyon, the remaining 
pieces being added ``trivially'' at the end. 

Given all this, it becomes a natural problem, from the point of view
of string theory, to study the decay of unstable NC solitons, using
(S1)-(S4) as guiding questions, as a toy model for the dynamics of
open string tachyons on unstable D-branes.

\subsection{Summary of Results}

We will see that it is in fact not possible to reproduce the 
qualitative behavior described above in the simple model 
\eqref{action}. A priori, one would not expect (S3) simply
because of the failure of (S1) in the context of NC tachyon
condensation. Indeed, while NC solitons have localized energy,
far away the field is in the usual vacuum that has local
propagating excitations. However, we note that intuitively
(S1) is sufficient but not necessary for (S3), and in this
sense, finding (S3) would have been a nice substitute for (S1).
And recall that the very existence of NC solitons at finite
$\theta$ relies on the fact that the kinetic term is a small
perturbation that does not destroy the qualitative properties
at infinite $\theta$. One could expect something similar in the 
time-dependent case.

What we will find is that, except for infinite $\theta$, the
energy that initially is stored in the soliton does not stay
localized, but is carried away to infinity in the form of
classical radiation. Nevertheless, the qualitative properties of 
the decay do depend on the noncommutativity parameter $\theta$. In 
particular, the decay rate is exponentially suppressed in $\theta$, 
for large $\theta$.

We will proceed as follows. We start with a review of NC scalar
solitons and their basic properties in section \ref{ncft}.
It turns out that restricted to rotationally symmetric configurations,
the system is similar to certain nonlinear lattices which exhibit 
the phenomenon of ``discrete breathers'', and we review those in 
section \ref{discrete} for completeness. We will then present 
some numerical results in section \ref{numerics} in order to 
illustrate the qualitative properties of the decay. In section 
\ref{estimate1}, we turn to reproducing this behavior through an 
approximate calculation of the decay rate. The technical core is 
here the explicit diagonalization of the linear problem in 
section \ref{A}, that puts us in a position to give a closed 
expression for the estimated decay rate in section \ref{estimate2}. 
The approximation method relies on a certain version of Fermi's 
Golden Rule that we will explain.

To conclude this introduction, we note that a different toy model
for tachyon condensation in string theory, based on conventional
field theory, has been considered by Zwiebach \cite{zwiebach30}. It 
would be interesting to compare the dynamics of the decay with our
present results. Also, Moeller and Zwiebach \cite{mozw} have studied 
the time evolution of decaying solitons in $p$-adic string theory. 
The relation to our work is not clear. Finally, we note that some of 
the problems that we study here have also been broached in \cite{acso} 
and \cite{acatrinei}.


\section{Noncommutative scalar field theory in $2+1$ dimensions and
its solitons}
\label{ncft}

The theory of our interest \eqref{action} is defined over a model of 
$2+1$-dimensional spacetime in which time is an ordinary variable and 
space is the two-dimensional quantum mechanical phase space of a 
nonrelativistic particle in one dimension. In other words, we base space
on the Heisenberg-Born-Jordan commutation relation, 
\begin{equation} 
[x,y] = \ii\theta \,. 
\eqlabel{nc} 
\end{equation} 

It is well-known since the times of Weyl, Wigner, and Moyal that the algebra 
of functions on this space is a deformation of the ordinary algebra 
$\calc(\reals^2)$ along the parameter $\theta$. In one particular ordering
prescription, the product can be written as
\begin{equation}
\Phi_1\star\Phi_2 (x,y) = \ee^{\ii \frac\theta2(\del_{\xi_1}\del_{\eta_2} - 
\del_{\xi_2}\del_{\eta_1})} 
\Phi_1(\xi_1,\eta_1) \Phi_2(\xi_2,\eta_2) |_{(\xi_1,\eta_1)=(\xi_2,\eta_2)=(x,y)}\,.
\eqlabel{moyal}
\end{equation} 

Upon representing the commutation relations \eqref{nc} in the usual manner on
Hilbert space $\calh$, eq.\ \eqref{moyal} turns into a prescription for 
translating a function over phase space, such as our field $\Phi$, into a linear 
operator on $\calh$. Moreover, derivatives become commutators,
\begin{equation}
\del_x \longleftrightarrow \frac\ii\theta [y,\cdot]\,, \qquad\qquad
\del_y \longleftrightarrow -\frac\ii\theta [x,\cdot] \,,
\eqlabel{derivatives}
\end{equation}
and the integral a trace,
\begin{equation}
\int dx\, dy \longleftrightarrow 2\pi\theta\tr \,.
\eqlabel{trace}
\end{equation}
This yields, after setting
\begin{equation}
a = \frac 1{\sqrt{2\theta}} (x+\ii y)\,, \qquad\qquad
a^\dagger = \frac 1{\sqrt{2\theta}} (x-\ii y) \,,
\eqlabel{osci}
\end{equation}
the following expression for $S$.
\begin{equation}
S = 2\pi\theta \int dt \tr\Bigl[ {\frac12} (\del_t\Phi)^2
- {\frac{1}{\theta}} [a,\Phi][\Phi,a^\dagger] - V(\Phi) \Bigr]
\eqlabel{actop}
\end{equation}
We also record the equations of motion
\begin{equation}
\del_t^2 \Phi +\frac 2\theta [a,[a^\dagger,\Phi]] + V'(\Phi) = 0 \,.
\eqlabel{eom}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Rotational symmetry}

These expressions simplify further on rotationally symmetric field 
configurations,
\begin{equation}
\Phi(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \lambda_n(t) P_n \,.
\eqlabel{ansatz}
\end{equation}
Here, $P_n="
