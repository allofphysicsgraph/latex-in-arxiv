     The acceleration-dependent system with noncommuting coordinates,
     proposed by Lukierski, Stichel and Zakrzewski [Ann. Phys. 260,
     224 (1997)]
     is derived as the non-relativistic limit of Mathisson's
     classical electron [Acta Physica Polonica 6, 218 (1937)],
     further discussed by Weyssenhoff and Raabe
     [Acta Physica Polonica 9, 7 (1947)].
     The two-parameter centrally extended Galilean symmetry of
     the model is recovered using elementary methods.
     The relation to Schr\""odinger's Zitternde Elektron
     is indicated.
