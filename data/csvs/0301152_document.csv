\begin{abstract}
We present an approach to the construction of Action Principles for first
order (in time derivatives) differential equations (the inverse problem of
the Calculus of Variations) and generalize it to field theory in order to
construct systematically, for integrable equations which are based on the
existence of a Nijenhuis (or hereditary) operator, a ladder of Action
Principles which is complementary to the well--known multi--Hamiltonian
formulation. We work out results for the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV)
equation, which is a member of the positive hierarchy related to the
hereditary operator. Three negative hierarchies of (negative) evolution
equations are defined naturally from the hereditary operator as well, in a
concise way, suitable for field theory. We identify the Liouville,
Sinh--Gordon, Hunter--Zheng and Camassa--Holm equations as negative ones.
The same multi--Lagrangian scheme for KdV is shown to apply also to these
and other positive and negative evolution equations. The Euler--Lagrange
equations arising from the Action Principles are equivalent to
deformations of the original evolution equation, and the deformations are
obtained explicitly in terms of the positive and negative evolution
vectors, which follows from the factorized hereditary operator. For
example, several nonequivalent, nonlocal Action Principles for KdV which
are time--reparametrization invariant are constructed, and a new Action
Principle for the deformed system Sinh--Gordon $+$ spatial translation
vector is presented. The factorized hereditary operator allows for the
explicit computation of local and nonlocal Hamiltonian operators, as the
inverses of all the nonequivalent symplectic $2$--forms in the ladder.
Nonlocal constants of the motion are constructed for KdV as well as for
positive and negative vectors, in a concise way. Alternative Lax pairs for
all negative vectors are constructed. Some results are mapped to the
Krichever--Novikov and Harry--Dym equations.

\section{Introduction}
Hereditary or Nijenhuis operators \cite{Fuc79,And82,Dor93} play an
important role in the description of integrable systems: in terms of these
operators, the very definition of the positive and negative hierarchies of
integrable evolution equations may be given, \cite{Fuc80} and they are
used to construct, for these equations, subsequent constants of the
motion, \cite{Boi84} alternative Lax pairs, \cite{{Bru95}}
multi--Hamiltonian \cite{Mag77} and multi--Lagrangian structures,
\cite{Nut00,{Nut01}} and symmetries. \cite{Fuc80,Boi84} For example, the
well--known Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation is a flow vector belonging
to the positive KdV hierarchy.

The problem of constructing multi--Lagrangian structures (i.e., an
infinite ladder of Action Principles) for the KdV equation has been
tackled recently, \cite{Nut00,{Nut01}} using the bi--Hamiltonian
formulation, with the only drawback that the explicit form of the Action
Principles associated to each symplectic $2$--form requires the
integration of the $2$--forms, a task which is increasingly difficult as
we move to the positive end of the ladder (quasi local symplectic forms),
and it gets worse as we move to the negative end of the ladder, where the
symplectic $2$--forms are increasingly nonlocal. The known way
\cite{Nut01} to get rid of the nonlocality problem is to write the Action
Principles in a ``local"" coordinate system (Darboux theorem) depending on
the specific symplectic $2$--form in the ladder, a process that gets
recurrently harder as we move to the negative end.

In this work, we make use of the Galilean symmetry \cite{Sch96} and the
factorized form of the hereditary operator \cite{Gut93} for the KdV
equation, to construct explicitly the Action Principles for KdV in the
positive as well as in the negative end of the ladder. No integration of
any $2$--form is needed, nor is the search for a special coordinate
system. The factorized form of the symplectic $2$--forms allows for the
interpretation of the resulting Euler--Lagrange equations (arising from
each Action Principle) as deformed equations, with flows given by KdV $+$
vectors in the positive and negative hierarchies, which are computed
explicitly. The above construction also leads to explicit, nonrecurrent
expressions for local and nonlocal constants of the motion for KdV.

From the Action Principles obtained for the KdV equation we construct
Action Principles for flows defined by other positive and negative
vectors. In particular, new Action Principles for the Sinh--Gordon (ShG)
\cite{Rub70} equation (a negative equation) are constructed.

On the other hand, alternative Lax pairs for the KdV equation and for
positive KdV flows have been constructed from the hereditary operator.
\cite{Bru95} We do the same for all the negative KdV flows, and we
conclude that the local and nonlocal constants of the motion for KdV,
define conserved currents for the negative vectors as well.

The results here may be mapped to the following equations:
Krichever--Novikov, Harry--Dym, \cite{Gol91} Camassa--Holm, \cite{Hon99}
Hunter--Zheng, \cite{Bru02} and Liouville, all of which are essentially
flows belonging to the KdV positive and negative hierarchies. The results
are quite general and may be extended to other systems related to
hereditary operators (e.g., nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation).

This paper is organized as follows: section \ref{sec:Pre} presents a
preview and notation for the method of construction of Action Principles
for given differential evolution equations, and a brief survey of
symmetries and constants of the motion in this context. Next, the
relationship of these Principles with Hamiltonian theories, and finally
the hereditary property with the consequent construction of the positive
and negative hierarchies of integrable evolution equations. In section
\ref{sec:Ladders} we present and prove theorems on the explicit
construction of ladders of Action Principles and constants of the motion,
based on the hereditary operator and the Galilean symmetry, and we show
how these Action Principles give rise to Euler--Lagrange equations which
are deformations of the original equations, due to the fact that the
symplectic operators have a nonzero kernel. Section \ref{sec:example KdV}
is devoted to examples of the above constructions for the KdV equation. We
obtain concise expressions for the negative vectors, for the Action
Principles, and for the deformed Euler--Lagrange equations. Symplectic
operators are presented in factorized form (this allows for factorized
expressions for the Hamiltonian operators). Some known integrable
evolution equations are identified within the negative hierarchies.
Finally, nonlocal constants of the motion for KdV are concisely obtained
using the internal symmetries and the negative Action Principles. In
section \ref{sec:results negative} we work out examples of new Action
Principles for the ShG equation, which in this context is identified as a
negative vector; we construct Lax pairs for the negative equations, and
conclude that the local and nonlocal constants of the motion for KdV also
work for negative equations. Finally, some
concluding remarks are presented in section \ref{sec:conc}.\\

For simplicity, we work in finite--dimensional notation. All assertions
and theorems in sections \ref{sec:Pre} and \ref{sec:Ladders} are valid in
finite dimensions, and they can be extended to the case of field theory in
all the instances dealt with in this paper.

\section{Preview and Notation}
\label{sec:Pre} Consider the autonomous equations of motion
\begin{equation}\label{eq:motion} \dot{q}^{\textrm{a}}(t) =
V^{\textrm{a}}[q^{\textrm{b}}(t)]\,,\quad{\textrm{a}} \in A\,.
\end{equation}
$A$ is a given ordered set called ``label set"": the elements of it label
the degrees of freedom of the theory. From now on, we suppress the
dependence of the coordinates $\{q^{{\textrm{a}}}\}_{{\textrm{a}} \in  A}$
on time when it is obvious.

\begin{ex} The KdV Equation for the field $u(x,t)$, \mbox{$x \in [x_-,x_+]$,}
$t\in {\mathbb{R}}$, is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:KdV}
u_t = - u_{xxx} -12\, u\, u_x\,
\end{equation}
(suffixes denote partial differentiation). The label set is identified as
${\mathrm{A}} = [x_-,x_+]$, and $x\in \mathrm{A}$ is a continuous index.

We will use standard boundary conditions for the field: $u,\,u_x,\,\ldots
\to 0\,$ as $x \to x_\pm$, although the methods may be extended for the
treatment of other boundary conditions as well (in which case the Weiss
Action Principle \cite{Sud74} and the  Witten--Zuckerman $2$--form
\cite{Wit86} come into play).
\end{ex}

\begin{rem}
Einstein summation convention over repeated indices is assumed from here
on (for the infinite--dimensional case, the summation is extended to an
integration over continuous indices).
\end{rem}

The evolution equation (\ref{eq:motion}) defines naturally a vector space,
spanned by the derivatives $\{\frac{\partial}{\partial
{q}^{\mathrm{a}}}\}_{{\mathrm{a}} \in {\mathrm{A}}}$ (for the
infinite--dimensional case, partial derivatives with respect to the
coordinates become functional derivatives). We call $V =
V{}^{\mathrm{a}}\,\frac{\partial}{\partial {q}^{\mathrm{a}}}$ the \textbf{flow} vector or
evolution vector for the system. It is an invariant structure, i.e., it is
independent of the coordinate system used.


\subsection{Action Principles}

The equations of motion (\ref{eq:motion}) are related to a
\textbf{Variational Principle} with \textbf{Action}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:action}
 {S}[q{}^{\mathrm{a}}(t),t] =
\int_{t{}_{\mathrm{o}}}^{t_1} dt\,\bigg(P{}_{\mathrm{a}}\,\left( \dot{q}{}^{\mathrm{a}} - V{}^{\mathrm{a}}
\right)+ K\bigg)\,,
\end{equation}
 where the $1$--form $P[q{}^{\mathrm{b}}]$ and the zero-form $K[q{}^{\mathrm{b}}]$
satisfy the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
   P{}_{\mathrm{a,b}} V{}^{\mathrm{b}} + P{}_{\mathrm{b}} V{}^{\mathrm{b}}{}{}_{\mathrm{, a}}  =
 K{}_{\mathrm{ , a}}\,,
\end{equation*}
with $K{}_{\mathrm{ , a}}\equiv \frac{\partial K}{\partial q{}^{\mathrm{a}}}\,.$

We rewrite the above equation in terms of invariant structures:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pair}
 \underset{{V}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{}} P = \delta K\,,
\end{equation}
where $\underset{{V}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{}}$ is the \textbf{Lie derivative} along the vector $V$, and
$\delta$ is the \textbf{exterior differential} (see \cite{Nak92} for a
definition of these operators).

We call the pair $(P;\,K)$, $1$--form $P$ and $0$--form $K$, a
\textbf{standard Lagrangian pair} for $V$ if $K \neq 0$. In the special
case $K = 0$ we call $P$ a \textbf{non--standard Lagrangian }for $V$: the
latter case allows for the construction of constants of the motion in a
direct way \cite{Bus02} (see theorem \ref{thm:3}).

\begin{rem}The above objects should not be confused with the usual
``Lagrangian density"" ${{L}}[q,\,\dot{q},\,t] = P{}_{\mathrm{a}}\,\left(
\dot{q}{}^{\mathrm{a}} - V{}^{\mathrm{a}} \right)+ K\,,$ which is the thing that is
integrated in time to give the action: $S = \int {{L}}\,dt\,.$ The
$1$--form $P$ is also understood as the momentum map. \cite{Nut01} In the
special case $K=0\,,$ it solves the equation for a ``conserved covariant.""
\cite{Boi84}
\end{rem}

The general case of objects which depend explicitly on time is easily
worked out, \cite{Hoj81} but there is no need to do so in the applications
of this paper. Nevertheless, for symmetries and constants of the motion
the explicit time dependence will be necessarily taken into account. In
the sequel, we give the name \textbf{time--independent} to those objects
which do not depend \textbf{explicitly} on time, and viceversa.

The \textbf{Euler--Lagrange} equations which come from the Action
(\ref{eq:action}) are:
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma{}_{\mathrm{a b}} \left( \dot{q}{}^{\mathrm{b}} - V{}^{\mathrm{b}}\right) = 0\,,
\end{equation*}
where $\Sigma \equiv \delta P$ is the \textbf{symplectic $2$--form }or
Lagrange bracket whose components are:
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma{}_{\mathrm{a b}} =  P{}_{\mathrm{b,a}}- P{}_{\mathrm{a,b}}\,.
\end{equation*}
It is worth mentioning that, in \cite{Wit86}, a symplectic $2$--form is
induced by an Action Principle in essentially the same way we have derived
the above symplectic $2$--form from the Action Principle
(\ref{eq:action}).

Notice that these Euler--Lagrange equations do not imply the original
equations of motion (\ref{eq:motion}); instead they imply
\textbf{deformed} or mixed equations, where the deformation is represented
by an additive extra term which is an arbitrary linear combination of
vectors belonging to the \textbf{kernel} of the symplectic $2$--form. In
the case of KdV, we will obtain the deformations explicitly. See
\cite{Bus02} for examples in the finite dimensional case.

The symplectic $2$--form associated to this Action Principle is easily
seen to satisfy
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber \delta\, \Sigma &=& 0 {\textrm{\quad (closure)}}\\
\label{eq:symp2} \underset{{V}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{\,}} \Sigma &=& 0\,,
\end{eqnarray}
therefore the inverse process could be done: starting from a symplectic
$2$--form $\Sigma$ for the flow vector $V$, we construct the standard
Lagrangian $1$--form, from $\delta\,P = \Sigma$ and the $0$--form $K$ is
obtained by integration of equation (\ref{eq:pair}). This process suffers
from technical difficulties, which increase when the objects are infinite
dimensional and nonlocal. Fortunately, for the KdV equation there is a
constructive way of finding the Action Principles (see theorems
\ref{thm:1} and \ref{thm:2}).

\subsection{Hamiltonian theories are induced from Symplectic Structures}

The relationship of the symplectic $2$--form with the Hamiltonian
formulation is very simple: \cite{Olv93} consider the formal inverse
(i.e., except for a finite kernel that the operators may possess) of the
above $2$--form, the time--independent $(2,0)$ tensor $J$ such that
$J\cdot \Sigma = \mathbb{I}\,.$ It is possible to show that $\Sigma$ is
closed if and only if $J$ satisfies the \textbf{Jacobi identity}, which we
write in the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Jac}
  \underset{{J\cdot U}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{J}} = J\cdot \delta U\cdot J\,,\quad \forall \,\,1\textrm{--form }\,U\,.
\end{equation}
$J$ is known as a Hamiltonian operator or Poisson bracket. Now, equation
(\ref{eq:symp2}) implies $\underset{{V}}{{\mathcal{L}}} {{\,J}} = 0\,.$ Therefore, according to the
Jacobi Identity (\ref{eq:Jac}), a Hamiltonian theory for the flow $V$ is
induced by the symplectic $2$--form $\Sigma$: the equation $V=J\cdot U$
implies $\delta U=0$, thus $V = J\cdot \delta H\,,$ where $H$ is the
Hamiltonian, a time--independent $0$--form.

\subsection{Symmetries}

Symmetries play a crucial role in the construction of the Action
Principles. A symmetry for the system (\ref{eq:motion}) is known as a
vector with components ${\eta}^{\mathrm{a}}$ that takes solutions into solutions
of equation (\ref{eq:motion}), in the sense that given any solution
${q}^{\textrm{a}}(t)$ such that $\dot{q}^{\textrm{a}}(t) =
V^{\textrm{a}}[q^{\textrm{b}}(t)]\,,$ then $"
