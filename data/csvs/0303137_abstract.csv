The comparison of symmetries in the interior and the exterior 
of a domain wall is relevant when discussing the correspondence
between domain walls and branes, and also when studying the 
interaction of walls and magnetic monopoles. I discuss the symmetries
in the context of an $SU(N)\times Z_2$ model (for odd $N$) with a 
single adjoint scalar field. Situations in which the wall interior 
has less symmetry than the vacuum are easy to construct while the 
reverse situation requires significant engineering of the scalar 
potential.
