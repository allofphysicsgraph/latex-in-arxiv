\item[1)]
As emphasized (and partially justified with plausibility arguments) in
\cite{MN,N2}, the predicted asymptotic RN quasinormal frequencies do
not reduce to the Schwarzschild limit as the black hole charge $Q$
tends to zero;
\item[2)]
Quasinormal frequencies of a charged black hole, according to formula
(\ref{MNf}), depend not only on the black hole's Hawking temperature,
but also on the Hawking temperature of the (causally disconnected)
inner horizon;
\item[3)]
The authors suggest that, should the black hole mass and charge
acquire a small imaginary part (which in their words ``may not be an
unreasonable thing to do'', since ``the black hole eventually
evaporates''), their asymptotic RN frequencies would be proportional
to $\ln 2$. This is in stark contrast with the Schwarzschild results:
should this be true, Dreyer's argument could be used to infer that the
gauge group of Loop Quantum Gravity is SU(2);
\item[4)]
The result does not seem to agree with the conjectured behaviour
predicted by formula (\ref{conj}).
