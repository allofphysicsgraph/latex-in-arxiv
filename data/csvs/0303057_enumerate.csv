\item The action has the required invariance under the gauge 
transformation:
\begin{equation} \label{evor4}
T \to e^{2i\alpha(x)}\, T, \qquad A^{(1)}_\mu \to A^{(1)}_\mu + \partial_\mu 
\alpha(x), \qquad A^{(2)}_\mu \to A^{(2)}_\mu - \partial_\mu
\alpha(x)\, .
\end{equation}

\item For $T=0$ the action reduces to the sum of the usual 
DBI action on the individual branes.

\item If we require the fields to be invaiant under the symmetry 
$(-1)^{F_L}$ that exchanges the brane and the antibrane, we get the 
restriction:
\begin{equation} \label{evor5}
T = \hbox{real}, \qquad A^{(1)}_\mu = A^{(2)}_\mu\equiv A_\mu \, , \qquad 
Y^I_{(1)} = 
Y^I_{(2)}\equiv Y^I\, .
\end{equation}
Under this restriction the action becomes proportionl to that on a 
non-BPS D-$p$-brane, as given in (\ref{ez1}). This is a necessary 
consistency check, as modding out a brane-antibrane configuration by 
$(-1)^{F_L}$ is supposed to produce a non-BPS D-$p$-brane\cite{9904207}.
