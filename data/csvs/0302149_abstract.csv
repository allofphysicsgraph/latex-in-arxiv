It is shown that despite the possibility of a breakdown
of hyperbolicity, the $SU(2)$ Skyrme model can never
exhibit bulk  violations of
Einstein  causality
because its energy momentum tensor satisfies the dominant
energy condition. It also satisfies the strong energy condition.
The Born-Infeld-Skyrme model also satisfies both the
dominant and strong energy
conditions.
