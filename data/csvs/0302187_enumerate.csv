the algebra $\mathfrak{age}_1$ generated by $X_0,Y_{-1/2},M_0,Y_{1/2},X_1$. 
Adding the generator $N$, we obtain the  algebra 
$\wit{\mathfrak{age}}_1 := \mathfrak{age}_1 \oplus \mathbb{C} N$, which is the
{\it minimal standard parabolic subalgebra} (see appendix~C),
namely, it is the sum
of the  Cartan subalgebra and of the positive root spaces.
It is also possible to dismiss 
altogether the generator $X_0$ or replace it by any linear combination 
of $X_0$ and $N$.

the Schr\""odinger algebra $\mathfrak{sch}_1$. One may also add to it the 
generator $N$. We call 
$\wit{\mathfrak{sch}}_1 :={\mathfrak{sch}}_1\oplus \mathbb{C} N$ the 
parabolic subalgebra thus obtained.
\item
the algebra $\mathfrak{alt}_1$ generated by $D,Y_{-1/2}, M_0,Y_{1/2},V_+,X_1$.
As before, one may add the generator $N$ and obtains thus the
parabolic subalgebra
$\wit{\mathfrak{alt}}_1 := \mathfrak{alt}_1 \oplus \mathbb{C} N$.

\item the usual projective representation of the Schr\""odinger group becomes
a true representation, via conjugation by Fourier transformation with
respect to $\cal M$.
\item  a new relation between the Schr\""odinger Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sch}_d$ 
and the complexified conformal Lie algebra $(\mathfrak{conf}_{d+2})_{\C}$ is
found, namely
\BEQ
\mathfrak{sch}_d \subset (\mathfrak{conf}_{d+2})_{\C}
\EEQ
Some subalgebras of 
$(\mathfrak{conf}_{d+2})_{\C}$ closely related to parabolic subalgebras may
play a r\^ole in physical applications, notably to ageing phenomena in
spin systems. We leave the elaboration of this to future work. 

We also reconsidered an old claim \cite{Baru73} that $\mathfrak{sch}_d$ could
be obtained as a non-relativistic limit from a conformal Lie algebra. 
If the mass $\cal M$ is treated as a dynamic variable from the
beginning, we find in the non-relativistic limit $c\to\infty$ instead 
$(\mathfrak{conf}_{3})_{\C}\to\wit{\mathfrak{alt}}_1\ne\mathfrak{sch}_1$. 
\item the Ward identities which express the invariance of an action under 
conformal transformations, or merely under the Schr\""odinger subalgebra
$\mathfrak{sch}_d$ or else $\mathfrak{age}$, are derived from the `locality
assumption' eqs.~(\ref{4:gl:29}) or (\ref{4:gl:31}). An important open
question is the extension of $\mathfrak{sch}_d$ to an  
infinite-dimensional algebra - possibly ${\cal S}_1^{\infty}$ or
natural extensions thereof to $d$
spatial dimensions - such as to include those 
terms which would describe the contributions of anomalies coming from quantum 
fluctuations. In order to prepare such a study, 
we explicitly constructed the conserved
energy-momentum tensor (and also the probability current) which satisfy these
Schr\""odinger (or conformal) Ward identities. 
Further work along these lines is in progress. 

When applying these considerations to ageing, we must take into account that
time-translation invariance does no longer hold. This can be dealt with 
by allowing for a `boundary term' in the action and coming from the
$t=0$ initial conditions. Schematically, we have  
\BEQ
\left. \begin{array}{c}
\mbox{\rm spatial translation invariance} \\
\mbox{\rm phase shift invariance}\\
\mbox{\rm Galilei invariance} \\
\mbox{\rm scale invariance with $z=2$} \\
\mbox{\rm locality}
\end{array} \right\} \Longrightarrow 
\mbox{\rm special Schr\""odinger invariance} 
\EEQ
where locality is understood in the sense of 
eqs.~(\ref{4:gl:29},\ref{4:gl:31}). 
We emphasize that while time-translation invariance is not really needed,
Galilei invariance is a necessary condition for having an invariance under
the action of the special Schr\""odinger transformation generated by $X_1$. 

We have also seen that the classical free-field action is not invariant under 
the algebra ${\cal S}_1^{\infty}$, in contrast with the situation found for 
two-dimensional conformal invariance. 
\item tests of the predictions of Schr\""odinger invariance can 
be carried out by considering the following response functions
\BEA
R_2(t_1,s)&=&\frac{\delta \langle\phi(t_1)\rangle}{\delta h(s)} = 
\left\langle \phi(t_1) \wit{\phi}(s)\right\rangle = 
\left\langle \phi(t_1) {\phi}^*(s)\right\rangle 
\nonumber \\ 
R_3(t_1,t_2,s)&=&\frac{\delta \langle\phi(t_1)\phi(t_2)\rangle}{\delta h(s)} = 
\left\langle \phi(t_1)\phi(t_2) \wit{\phi}(s)\right\rangle = 
\left\langle \phi(t_1)\phi(t_2) {\phi}^*(s)\right\rangle 
\EEA
where $\wit{\phi}$ is the Martin-Siggia-Rose response operator associated with 
the order parameter scaling operator $\phi$ and $h$ is the conjugate magnetic 
field. Here $t_1, t_2$ are observation times and $s$ is a waiting time. 
Our results (\ref{5:gl:2},\ref{5:gl:3P},\ref{5:gl:2A}) suggest the 
identification $\wit{\phi}=\phi^*$ of the response operator $\wit{\phi}$ 
with the `complex conjugate'
$\phi^*$ in the formalism at hand. In particular, the causality conditions
$t_1>s$ and $t_2>s$ required for an interpretation of $R_2$ and $R_3$ as
response function were derived in a model-independent way. 

In several spin systems undergoing ageing, the resulting scaling form 
(\ref{5:gl:2A}) of the two-point response function $R_2$ has
been fully confirmed, see
\cite{Henk01,Godr02,Pico02,Henk02,Henk02a,Henk02b}. However, we are not aware
of any tests of (\ref{5:gl:2},\ref{5:gl:3P}) in {\em equilibrium} critical 
dynamics. It appears 
significant that covariance under at least the minimal parabolic subalgebra of 
the conformal algebra is required in order to fix the two-point function 
completely. Tests of the three-point response $R_3$ would be very interesting 
and might provide an answer to the open question which of the two parabolic
subalgebras $\wit{\mathfrak{alt}}$ or $\wit{\mathfrak{age}}$ is the
relevant one for the description of ageing phenomena. This will also require
the explicit inclusion of the effects of the initial conditions into the 
analysis, where work is in progress \cite{Pico03}.
