The Bousso bound requires that one quarter the area of a closed
codimension two spacelike surface exceeds the entropy flux across
a certain lightsheet terminating on the surface. The bound can be
violated by quantum effects such as Hawking radiation. It is
proposed that at the quantum level the bound be modified by adding
to the area the quantum entanglement entropy across the surface.
The validity of this quantum Bousso bound is proven in a
two-dimensional large N dilaton gravity theory.
