We find exact rotating and non-rotating neutral black hole solutions
in the G\""{o}del universe of the five dimensional minimal supergravity
theory.  We also describe the embedding of this solution in M-theory.
After dimensional reduction and T-duality, we obtain a supergravity
solution corresponding to placing a black string in a pp-wave
background.
