We introduce the relation between the holographic entropy bounds and the inflationary universe.
First  the holographic entropy bounds for radiation-dominated universe,
radiation-dominated universe with a positive cosmological constant are introduced. For  an
exact de Sitter phase, we  use the maximal entropy bound.
We classify  the inflation based on the quasi-de Sitter spacetime into
three steps: slow-roll period of inflation,   epoch of
reheating, and  radiation-dominated era. Then  we study how to apply
three entropy bounds to the three steps of the inflation.
 Finally we discuss our results.
