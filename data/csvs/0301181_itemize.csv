\item[({\bf Loc})] 
They must be {\em local\/}, i.e.\ genuine functions on $X$; thus  
their monodromies must be trivial. This means that one looks for solutions 
to \erf1 on $\hat X$ that are invariant under the subgroup of 
the mapping class group of $\hat X$
that commutes with $\sigma$. This subgroup can be identified with the
mapping class group of $X$. This requirement is known as modular invariance;
it includes also moduli of the conformal structure on $X$. 
\item[({\bf Fac})] 
They must possess {\em factorization\/} properties, which generalize 
the cluster property \erf{clus}.

(For a precise statement of factorization see, for instance, theorems
3.9 and 3.10 of  \cite{fffs3}.)

{\bf Theorem} \cite{fuRs}:\\
When the monodromies of a system of conformal blocks are described by
a modular tensor category, then a consistent set of correlation functions
solving ({\bf Loc}) and ({\bf Fac}) exists for each quadruple 
$(A,m,\eta,\eps)$ of the following data: $A$ is an object in the modular 
tensor category (and thus a superselection sector), $m$ is a multiplication
  $$ m:\quad A\oti A \to A $$
that is associative with respect to the associator, 
  \be  m \circ (m\oti \id_A) = m \circ (\id_A \oti m) \circ \alpha_{AAA}\,, 
  \labl{mult} \end{equation}
and $\eta\iN\Hom(\one,A)$ a unit morphism with respect to $m$.
\\
Finally, the morphism $\eps\iN\Hom(A,\one)$ is an appropriate generalization 
of a linear form that turns the algebra $(A,m,\eta)$ into a so-called 
{\em symmetric special Frobenius algebra\/}.
