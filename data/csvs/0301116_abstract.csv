I consider gravity induced 
over a smooth (finite thickness) soliton. Graviton kinetic term is coupled to
bulk scalar that develops solitonic vacuum expectation value. 
Couplings of Kaluza-Klein modes to soliton-localized matter are suppressed, giving rise to 
crossover distance $r_c=M_{P}^2/M_{*}^3$ between 4D and
5D behavior. This system can be viewed as a finite  thickness brane 
regularization  of the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati.
