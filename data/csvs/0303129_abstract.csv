The study of renormalization of Yang-Mills fields in the light-front
gauge has always been a delicate subject in that divergent {\em non-local}
terms arise from the calculations of Feynman diagrams. In this short
paper we show that this happened because of a deficiency in the gauge
fixing procedure that results in an incorrect propagator and propose a
cure for it by considering the {\em correct} propagator for the gauge
potential. We explicitly show that the use of our correct propagator
in the light-front leads to a vacuum polarization tensor at the
one-loop level that is free of non-local terms.
