We present a cosmological model in $1+m+p$ dimensions, where in
$m$-dimensional space there are uniformly distributed $p$-branes
wrapping over the extra $p$-dimensions. We find that during
cosmological evolution $m$-dimensional space expands with the exact 
power-law corresponding to pressureless matter while the extra
$p$-dimensions contract. Adding matter, we also obtain solutions having
the same property. We show that this might explain in a natural way
why the extra dimensions are small compared to the observed three
spatial directions.
