It was argued that the scattering of slowly moving BPS monopoles could be approximated as geodesic motion on the moduli space of static solutions. Atiyah and Hitchin then continued the programme by explicitly constructing the metric on the moduli space of two monopoles and then employing it to construct geodesics (see [\atiyah] and references therein). One of the most striking conclusions is that in a head on collision two monopoles scatter at $90^0$.  These techniques have since been applied to a variety of other models, including Abelian-Higgs vortices in two dimensions [\rubackt], ``lumps" of non-linear sigma models [\ward] and extremal black holes [\gibbons]. A common feature of all these models is that the static multi-soliton solutions saturate a Bogomol'nyi-type bound. This implies that there is no net force between the solitons, an essential ingredient in the geodesic approximation. The presence of the Bogomol'nyi bounds is a result of the fact that the models have supersymmetric extensions. Topological charges appear in the supersymmetry algebra from which one can deduce the Bogomol'nyi bound.  Given this deep connection with supersymmetry, it is natural to consider the scattering of solitons in the supersymmetric theory itself. Since the fermionic equations of motion of the supersymmetric theory are trivially satisfied by setting all the fermions to zero, the static soliton solutions of the bosonic theory continue to be solutions in the supersymmetric theory. However, the inclusion of the fermions dramatically changes the quantum theory. Now there will be fermionic zero modes in addition to the bosonic zero modes in the fluctuations about the classical soliton solution. After quantisation, the fermionic zero modes imply that there is a multiplet of soliton states degenerate in energy (assuming that the supersymmetry is not dynamically broken).  This illustrates a crucial difference in principle between the scattering of solitons in the bosonic and supersymmetric theories. In the bosonic theory the geodesic approximation is developed by viewing the time evolution of the classical solitons as that of a fictitious particle moving in an infinite dimensional configuration space, the space of time independent, finite energy field configurations. That is, the analysis is purely classical (although the quantum case can, of course, also be considered [\nick,\bernd,\trevor]). In the supersymmetric case the r\^ole of the fermionic zero modes is only manifest after quantisation. To discuss the scattering of solitons in this case, it is thus necessary to construct an effective action which, upon quantisation, describes the low energy dynamics of the system. In this paper we construct such an action for a particular class of models by employing a collective co-ordinate expansion.  In the bosonic case, the collective co-ordinate expansion is essentially an equivalent way to develop the geodesic approximation. The fluctuations about the soliton solution contain zero modes that determine the low-energy dynamics. For each zero mode one must introduce a collective co-ordinate. The collective co-ordinates are the arbritrary parameters or moduli that a general static soliton solution depends on i.e. they can be considered as providing co-ordinates on the moduli space of static solutions. More physically, they can be interpreted as corresponding to the positions and ``charges" of the solitons. By allowing the collective co-ordinates to depend on time and ignoring the contributions of the non-zero modes one constructs an ansatz for the low-energy fields. After substituting this ansatz into the action one obtains an effective action describing the low-energy dynamics of the system. The effective action is that of a free particle propagating on the moduli space of static solutions, with the metric being naturally induced from the kinetic energy functional of the parent field theory. The solutions to the equations of motion of the effective action are simply the geodesics on the moduli space.   If the exact soliton solutions are explicitly known, this procedure can be carried out directly. This is the approach employed in the study of the scattering of the lumps of bosonic sigma models [\ward]. For most models, however, less is known about the soliton solutions. Nevertheless, in some special cases, such as the scattering of two solitons (the case of most interest), the geometry of the moduli space can still be derived using indirect methods relying on identifying the various symmetries of the model. This approach has successfully been used in the monopole system [\atiyah].  In the supersymmetric case we can use a blend of techniques. It is a generic phenomenon that the solutions saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound, i.e. the static soliton solutions, only break half of the supersymmetry. We will show how the unbroken supersymmetry pairs the bosonic zero modes with the fermionic zero modes. Using this we can  formally perform the collective co-ordinate expansion for the fermions and bosons. After identifying the geometric structures of the moduli space we can then utilise any of the results of the bosonic case that have been obtained either directly or indirectly. We will see that this naturally leads to an effective action which is a kind of supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the moduli space. We note that a similar method was employed in [\harvey] to show that the low-energy scattering of axions with 5-branes in superstring theory is related to the Donaldson polynomial. This connection between geometry and low-energy supersymmetric dynamics was one of the inspirations for this work.  We note that the procedure outlined above for deriving the low energy effective action involves neglecting all of the modes apart from the zero modes. Upon quantisation this is equivalent to assuming that the low energy dynamics may be described by a wave function of field configurations in which all but the zero modes are in the ground state. One may wonder about the validity of this approximation. In particular this approximation seems most vulnerable for the situations where the field theory has a continuous spectrum (e.g. monopoles, sigma model lumps). In these cases one may ask whether or not solitons with fermionic zero modes excited are stable against the emmission of soft ``photinos". If supersymmetry is not dynamically broken then the spectrum of soliton states will be exactly degenerate which implies the stability of the states. In some cases, including the models considered in this paper, the issue of supersymmetry breaking can be decided by calculating the Witten index $\rm Tr(-1)^F$ or one of its variants [\wittent].  %Even given the stability of the states one can still envisage that %in the low energy %scattering of say two ``monopolinos" (monopoles %with excited fermion zero modes) %it is energetically favourable for them to emit low energy %photinos and hence be interchanging their nature during the scattering. %Obviously, the effective action could not %describe this behaviour. Our approach is to assume that at low enough energy all radiation processes are significantly supressed and that the effective action just depending on the zero modes is a good approximation. The range of validity of this approximation will depend on the detailed dynamics of the model considered. Of course for models such as the Abelian Higgs model for which there is a mass gap we expect the effective action to be a particularly robust approximation to the true dynamics.  An important class of states of the effective action are the normalisable wave functions with lowest energy. These correspond to bound states of the full quantum field theory as there are no other states with lower energy into which they could decay. We will see that the normalisable states of the effective action with zero energy are given by normalisable harmonic forms on the moduli space.   There is a variety of interesting supersymmetric models to consider. It would be extremely interesting to investigate the Montonnen and Olive conjecture [\montonnen] concerning the self-duality of $N=4$ super Yang-Mills under the interchange of magnetic and electric charges, along with the monople and elementary particle sectors of the spectrum and the interchange of strong and weak coupling. Presumably some insight into this conjecture could be attained by studying the low-energy scattering of monopoles. Another interesting case to consider would be supersymmetric vortices. It is known that in a head on collision bosonic vortices scatter at $90^0$ at least in the abelian-Higgs model [\rubackt]. It has been further shown that this provides a plausibility argument as to why cosmic strings intercommute [\shellard], a crucial property in cosmic string based cosmology. It is natural to wonder how the presence of fermionic zero modes could alter these phenomena.  In this paper we study the low energy dynamics of the lumps of $N=2$ non-linear sigma models in d=$2+1$ based on an arbitrary K\"ahler target manifold. Such sigma models have been studied for a variety of reasons. In $d=2+1$ the non-linear sigma model is not a renormalisable quantum field theory so it should be viewed as describing some low-energy effective behaviour in planar physics with an in built cutoff. Our main motivation for studying these models is that they do not have any of the additional complications that the gauge invariance introduces in the models mentioned above. We will return to a study of those models in the future [\jerome].  The Witten index of the $CP^N$ sigma models is given by $Tr(-1)^F=N+1$ [\wittent]. Thus supersymmetry is not dynamically broken for these models and this ensures the stability of the lump states with fermionic zero modes excited, despite the fact that the system has a continuous spectrum. The non-renormalisability of the model is not relevant for our discussions as we are only interested in the very low-energy dynamics. There is one feature of sigma model solitons that is not shared by other models: the number of normalisable zero modes is smaller than the dimension of the moduli space. We will discuss this point further in the text and see that it brings in some complications in the analysis of the quantum theory. Despite this latter point, we believe that this model is a good laboratory to both investigate most conceptual issues and to develop some techniques for discussing the low-energy dynamics of supersymmetric solitons in general.  The classical scattering of lumps in the bosonic $CP^1$ and $CP^N$ sigma-models has been studied by various authors [\ward,\zak-\leese]. The geometry of the moduli space for an arbitrary K\"ahler target was elucidated by Ruback [\ruback] and his results will be important in the following. After first reviewing the bosonic case and introducing some notation in section 2, we will then discuss the supersymmetric sigma models in section 3. We discuss how the soliton solutions break half of the supersymmetry and show how the unbroken supersymmetry pairs the bosonic and fermionic zero modes. The collective co-ordinate expansion will then lead to an effective supersymmetric quantum mechanics action describing the low-energy dynamics of the solitons. The quantisation of the effective action is discussed in section 4. We show that the Hilbert space of states is given by anti-holomorphic forms on the moduli space of static solutions. We also show that the zero energy bound states are given by normalisable elements of the cohomology classes $H^{{(0,p)}$ of the moduli space and we argue that they correspond to bound lump states in the full quantum field theory of the sigma model. In an appendix we discuss how the operator ordering in the quantum mechanics of the effective action is related to the operator ordering in the vaccuum sector of the parent sigma model. Section 5 contains some conclusions.     \chapter{{Bosonic Lumps} Consider a bosonic non-linear sigma model with an arbitrary  K\"ahler target manifold M, described by the action $$ S=-{{1\over 2}\int d^3xg_{{ij}(\phi(x))\partial_m\phi^i\partial _n\phi^j\eta^{{mn}\eqn\sig $$ where $\phi^i$ and $g_{{ij},\ \ i,j=1...2n$ are co-ordinates and the metric on M, respectively. To obtain the static soliton or lump solutions to the equations of motion, we first rewrite the action in the form $$ S=\int dt(K-V)\qquad,\eqn\sigt $$ where the kinetic energy functional is given by $$ K={{1\over 2}\int d^2x g_{{ij}\dot\phi^i\dot\phi^j \eqn\kin $$ and the potential energy functional is $$ V={{1\over 2}\int d^2x g_{{ij}\partial_\mu\phi^i\partial _\mu\phi^j \qquad,\eqn\pot $$ where $\mu=1,2$. The total conserved energy is $E=K+V$.  The configuration space of the system, $\CC$, is the set of all finite energy maps from $R^2$ to M. The action can then be viewed as describing the motion of a fictitious particle moving on the infinite dimensional space $\CC$ under the influence of the potential \pot . In this spirit, the kinetic energy functional naturally defines a metric on $\CC$. Specifically, if we let $\dot\chi^i(x),\,\dot\rho^i(x)$ be two tangent vectors above the point $\phi^i(x)\in\CC$, then the metric $\tilde g$ is given by $$ \tilde g(\dot\chi,\dot\rho)\equiv \int d^2x g_{{ij}(\phi(x))\dot\chi^i(x) \dot\rho^j(x)\qquad. \eqn\metc $$ Similarly, the complex structure $J$ on the K\"ahler target induces a natural complex structure $\tilde J$ on \CC\ via $$ \left[\tilde J\dot\chi\right]^i(x)\equiv {{J^i}_j(\phi(x))\dot\chi^j(x) \qquad.\eqn\compc $$ The geometry of \CC\ was described in detail in [\ruback] and, assuming that \CC\ is at least an incomplete manifold (as we also will), it was shown that $(\CC,\tilde g,\tilde J)$ is in fact K\"ahler.  Static solutions to the equations of motion of \sig\ are obtained by minimising the static energy functional $V$. As is well known, \pot\ can be recast in the form $$ V={{1\over 4}\int d^2x D^{{\pm}_\mu\phi^i D^{{\pm}_\mu\phi^j g_{{ij} \mp T \qquad,\eqn\pott $$ where $$ D^{{\pm}_\mu\phi^i=\partial_\mu\phi^i\pm {{J^i}_j\epsilon_{{\mu\nu} \partial_\nu\phi^j \eqn\hol $$ and $$ T=\int_{{R^2}\phi^*(\omega) =\int d^2 x g_{{ik}{{J^k}_j\partial_\mu\phi^i\partial_\nu \phi^j\epsilon_{{\mu\nu} \eqn\kal $$ is the  integral of the pull back of the K\"ahler form on M. Since the K\"ahler form defines a non-trivial element of the second cohomology class $H^2(M,R)$, $T$ is a topological invariant. (For $M=CP^N$, it is, up to normalisation, an integer labelling the 2-d instanton number; the instantons in d=2 become the static lumps in d=2+1). The configuration space \CC\ is partitioned into different topological sectors labelled by the topological charge $T$.  {{}From \pott\ we can deduce the Bogomol'nyi bound on the static energy functional $$ E\ge \vert T\vert\qquad.\eqn\bog $$ Within each topological class of maps labelled by the topological charge $T$, the energy is minimised when the Bogomol'nyi bound \bog\ is saturated. Thus the static soliton solutions to the equations of motion are obtained by solving the first order differential equations $D^\pm_\mu\phi^i=0$. By switching to complex co-ordinates it is easily seen that this corresponds to (anti-)holomorphic maps: $\p_{{\bar z}\phi^\alpha=0\ (\p_z\phi^\alpha=0)$. In the following we will restrict our considerations to the case of holomorphic maps; the analysis can be trivially extended to the case of anti-holomorphic maps.  In general, the holomorphic maps will depend on a continuous set of parameters, or moduli. These moduli can be interpreted as the positions and ``charges" of the static lumps. The moduli space $M_N\subset \CC$ is defined as the set of all holomorphic maps within a given topological class $T=N$. Clearly the dimension of the moduli space is determined by the number of moduli. The existence of exact static charge $N$-lump configurations relies on the Bogomol'nyi bound being saturated. This can be interpreted as saying that there is no net force between the (static) lumps. This is entirely analogous to the case of BPS monopoles. Thus, following the work by Manton [\manton], Ward  suggested in [\ward] that the scattering of slowly moving lumps could be approximated by assuming that the evolution is adiabatic in the space of static soultions. That is, the time evolution is determined by geodesic motion in the moduli space $M_N$.  The low energy scattering problem is thus reduced to determining the geometry of $M_N$ and calculating its geodesics. We first introduce some notation. We denote the most general N-lump solution by $\phi^i_o(x,X)$ where the moduli $X^a, \ a=1,...,2k=dim(M_N)$, can be considered as co-ordinates on $M_N$. The maps $\phi^i_o(x,X)$ can be considered as providing alternative co-ordinates on $M_N$. By letting the moduli $X$ depend on a parameter $t$, which we interpret as time, we obtain the tangent vectors on $M_N$ by differentiation: $$ \dot\phi^i_o(x,X(t))\vert_{{t=0}=\left.{{\p\phi^i_o\over \p X^a} \right\vert_{{t=0}\dot X^a\equiv \delta_a\phi^i\dot X^a\qquad.\eqn\tv $$ Geometrically, $\delta_a\phi^i$ is the matrix corresponding to a change of co-ordinates. Physically, for each $a$ they are simply the zero modes in the fluctuations about the solution $\phi^i_o(x)\equiv \phi^i_o(x,X(0))$. This can be seen by noting that, by definition, $V(\phi_o^i(x,X(t))=V(\phi_o^i(x))$.  A metric $\CG$ on $M_N$ is naturally induced by the restriction of the metric \metc\ on \CC : $$ \CG(  \dot\phi_o,\dot\phi_o)\equiv  \CG_{{ab}(\phi_o)\dot X^a\dot X^b\qquad, \eqn\met $$ where $$ \CG_{{ab}=\int d^2x g_{{ij}(\phi_o(x))\delta_a\phi^i\delta_b\phi^j \eqn\metm $$ is the representation in the co-ordinates $\{{X^a\}$. We note that the physical assumption, due to finiteness of energy, of only considering zero modes with finite norm (i.e. $\CG_{{ab}$ finite) is equivalent to only considering tangent vectors with finite length. Thus, although it might seem that an arbitrary holomorphic perturbation of a holomorphic map within a given topological class would be a zero mode, only a finite number of them will have finite norm. A feature peculiar to sigma model solitons is that the number of normalisable zero modes is less than the dimension of $M_N$ [\ward]. Thus the time evolution of slowly moving lumps will be geodesic motion on some submanifold $\tilde M_N\subset M_N$, defined by fixing all the collective co-ordinates corresponding to zero modes with infinite norm to be constant.  It was shown in [\ruback] that if $\dot \phi_o^i$ is a tangent vector to $M_N$ then so is $[\tilde J\dot\phi_o]$. Thus the restriction of the complex structure \compc\ on \CC\ provides a natural complex structure on the moduli space. In the co-ordinates $\{{X^a\}$ it has the following form: $$ {{\CJ^a}_b=\CG^{{ac}\int d^2x{{J^i}_jg_{{ik}\delta_c\phi^k \delta_b\phi^j\qquad. \eqn\com $$ The property $\CJ^2=-{{\bf 1}$ is most easily verified using the co-ordinates $\phi^i_o(x,X)$. By a generalisation of the argument in [\ruback], it is clear that \com\ provides a complex structure on $\tilde M_N$ by restricting the zero modes to have finite norm. Thus $(\tilde M_N, \CG, \CJ)$ is a K\"ahler manifold.  We conclude this section with a brief discussion of the symmetry groups of the various spaces we have been discussing. From \metc\ it is clear that the isometry group of $(\CC,\tilde g)$ is given by the product of the isometry group of $R^2$ with the isometry group of the target manifold $M$. Considering \compc\ we conclude that the subgroup given by the product of the isometry group of $R^2$ with the group of holomorphic isometries on $M$ are holomorphic isometries of $(\CC,\tilde g,\tilde J)$. The holomorphic isometries of $(\CC,\tilde g,\tilde J)$ are holomorphic isometries of $(M_N,\CG,\CJ)$ since they both act covariantly on the static equations of motion and they preserve the topological charge \kal. The combination of these isometries that do not shift the collective co-ordinates held fixed in defining $\tilde M_N$ provide the isometries of this space.  \chapter{{Supersymmetric Lumps} The sigma model \sig\ has a supersymmetric extension given by $$ S=-{{1\over 2}\int d^3x\left\{{g_{{ij}\partial_m\phi^i\partial _n\phi^j\eta^{{mn} +i\bps^i\Ds\psi^j g_{{ij}+{{1\over 6}R_{{ijkl}\bps^i\psi^k \bps^j\psi^l\right\}\eqn\susysig $$ where $\psi^i$ is a set of two component Majorana SL(2,R) spinors that transform as a vector on the target manifold M. The covariant derivative in \susysig\ is defined using the pullback of the connection on M: $$ D_m\psi^i=\partial_m\psi^i+{{\Gamma^i}_{{jk}\partial_m\phi^j \psi^k\qquad.\eqn\covd $$ Our conventions for the gamma matrices are as follows: ${{(\gamma^1)^\alpha}_\beta={{(\sigma^1)^\alpha}_\beta,\ {{(\gamma^2)^\alpha}_\beta={{(\sigma^3)^\alpha}_\beta,\ {{(\gamma^0)^\alpha}_\beta=C_{{\alpha\beta}= {{(i\sigma^2)^\alpha}_\beta$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix. The Dirac adjoint is thus given by ${{\bar\psi}^i={{\psi^i}^\dagger\gamma^0= {{\psi^i}^TC$.  The action is invariant under the supersymmetry transformation $$ \eqalign{{ \delta\phi^i&=i\bep^1\psi^i\cr \delta\psi^i&=\ds\phi^i\epsilon^1-i{{\Gamma^i}_{{jk}\bps^j\epsilon^1 \psi^k\cr}\eqn\onesusy $$ where $\epsilon^1$ is a constant anticommuting Majorana spinor. Additional supersymmetries require a reduction of the holonomy of M [\zumino,\alvarez]. In the case at hand, M is K\"ahler and hence there is an additional supersymmetry given by $$ \eqalign{{ \delta\phi^i&=i\bep^2{{J^i}_j\psi^j\cr \delta\psi^i&=-{{J^i}_j\ds\phi^j\epsilon^2 -i{{\Gamma^i}_{{jk}{{J^k}_l\bep^2\psi^l \psi^j\cr}\eqn\twosusy $$ where $\epsilon^2$ is a second constant anticommuting Majorana spinor.  The fermionic equations of motion of \susysig\ are trivially satisfied by setting all of the fermions to zero. Thus the static soliton solutions of the bosonic theory continue to be solitons in the supersymmetric theory. In the following we will call the solution $\p_\bz\phi_o^\alpha=\psi_o ^\alpha=0$ the supersymmetric solution, where $\alpha=1,...,n$ are holomorphic co-ordinates on the target.  The supersymmetric solutions break half of the supersymmetry. By this we mean that of the four dimensional space spanned by the supersymmetry parameters, the solution is left invariant by a two dimensional subspace. To see this we use holomorphic co-ordinates and introduce the following hermitean projection operator in the spinor space: $$\Gamma={{1\over4}\gamma^z\gamma^\bz, \eqn\proj $$ satisfying $$ \Gamma^2=\Gamma,\qquad \Gamma+\Gamma^*=1,\qquad \Gamma\Gamma^*=0 \eqn\projp $$ where $\gamma^z\equiv\gamma^1+i\gamma^2$.  After redefining the supersymmetry paramaters via $$ \chi\equiv\epsilon^1+i\epsilon^2 \qquad \Gamma\chi\equiv\rho \qquad \Gamma^*\chi\equiv\sigma \eqn\spdec $$ the $N=2$ supersymmetry transformations \onesusy, \twosusy\ acting on a static bosonic holomorphic map $\phi^\alpha_o$ are given by $$ \eqalign{{ \delta_\sigma\phi^\alpha&= i\bsi^*\psi^\alpha\cr \delta_\sigma\psi^\alpha&=-i{{\Gamma^\alpha}_ {{\beta\gamma}|_{{\phi_o}\bsi^*\psi^\beta\psi^\gamma\cr }\eqn\ususy $$ and $$ \eqalign{{ \delta_\rho\phi^\alpha&=0\cr \delta_\rho\psi^\alpha&=\gamma^z\partial_z\phi_o^\alpha\rho^* -i{{\Gamma^\alpha}_{{\beta\gamma}|_{{\phi_o}\brh^*\psi^\beta\psi^\gamma\cr }\eqn\bsusy $$ where we have used the fact that for a K\"ahler manifold the Christoffel symbol is pure in its holomorphic indices. When the fermions are set to zero, $\delta_\sigma$ is the unbroken supersymmetry leaving the supersymmetric solution invariant and $\delta_\rho$ is the broken supersymmetry.  This partial breaking of supersymmetry is a generic feature of supersymmetric field theories admitting topologically non-trivial solutions. It was first noticed by Witten and Olive [\witten] and is best understood by showing that the algebra of supersymmetry charges are modified by topological charges (see [\jeromet] for a model independent discussion of this). For the N=2 supersymmetric sigma model it was shown in [\ruback] that the supersymmetry algebra is given by $$ \left\{{Q^I_\alpha,Q^J_\beta\right\}= \delta^{{IJ}P^m(\gamma_m)_{{\alpha\beta} +T\epsilon^{{IJ}C_{{\alpha\beta} \eqn\susyalg $$ where $T$ is the topological charge \kal. Furthermore, from \susyalg\ we can deduce the Bogomol'nyi bound \bog\ and that the bound is saturated iff the solution breaks half of the supersymmetry.  We now turn to a discussion of the zero modes in the fluctuations about the supersymmetric solution. The bosonic zero modes are exactly the same as for the bosonic sigma model since after setting the fermions to zero in the equations of motion of the supersymmetric model one obtains the same equations of motion as in the bosonic model. The fermionic zero modes are normalisable c-number solutions to the Dirac equation in the presence of the soliton background. A metric on the space of fermion zero modes is induced by the fermion kinetic term in the action \susysig: $$\CG'_{{a'b'}= \int d^2x g_{{ij}(\phi_o(x))(\psi^i_{{a'})^T\psi^j_{{b'} \eqn\fermet $$ where we have denoted the fermionic zero modes by $\psi^i_{{a'}$. Restricting our considerations to normalisable zero modes is equivalent to demanding that $\CG'_{{a'b'}$ has finite entries.  Two normalisable fermionic zero modes are immediately obtained from the broken supersymmetry. The fermionic part of the supersymmetry transformation of the supersymmetric solution is given by $$ \psi^\alpha=\gamma^z\p_z\phi_o^\alpha\rho^* \qquad,\eqn\ozm $$ and it is straightforward to verify that it satisfies $\Ds(\psi^\alpha)=0$. Clearly these zero modes satisfy $\Gamma\psi^\alpha=\psi^\alpha$. These modes can be interpreted as the Goldstone modes of the broken supersymmetry.  Following an argument by Zumino [\zuminot] in the context of instantons, we will now show that the unbroken supersymmetry pairs {{\it all} of the bosonic and fermionic zero modes. This pairing will be crucial to the derivation of the effective action. After imposing the following restrictions $$ \partial_\bz\phi^\alpha=0 \qquad\psi^\alpha=\Gamma\psi^\alpha \qquad,\eqn\eomans $$ the equations of motion for time independent configurations take the form $$ \partial_\bz\phi^\alpha= \partial_\bz\psi^\alpha=0 \qquad.\eqn\eomp $$ Returning to the supersymmetric solution $\partial_\bz\phi_o^\alpha=\psi^\alpha_o=0$, this seems to indicate that any holomorphic bosonic or fermionic perturbations are zero modes. In particular, it is surprising that the Dirac equation does not seem to depend on the background. We discussed in detail in the last section that the normalisable bosonic zero modes are restricted by requiring that the metric on the moduli space \metm\ has finite entries. The fermionic zero modes are similarly restricted by demanding that the c-number holomorphic perturbations be normalisable (finite entries in \fermet). We note that this also resolves the apparent paradox of the background independence of the Dirac equation in \eomp.  The linearly realised supersymmetry now reads $$ \delta_\sigma\phi^\alpha=i\bsi^*\psi^\alpha \qquad\delta_\sigma\psi^\alpha=0 \qquad.\eqn\linsusy $$ If we let $\psi^\alpha$ be a normalisable fermionic zero mode and we let $\sigma$ also be a c-number spinor, it is clear that \linsusy\ generates a normalisable bosonic zero mode. This would seem to imply that for each fermionic zero mode there are two bosonic zero modes. However, because the supersymmetry algebra \susyalg\ has an $SO(2)$ automorphism group, these bosonic zero modes are not independent. Using this we can invert \linsusy\ to supersymmetrically pair the zero modes via $$ \psi_p^\alpha=\delta_p\phi^\alpha\epsilon\eqn\pairing $$ where $\epsilon$ is a c-number spinor satisfying $\Gamma\epsilon =\epsilon$, $\epsilon^\dagger\epsilon=1$ and here and in the following $p,q,r$ are holomorphic co-ordinates on $\tilde M_N$. Thus for each normalisable bosonic zero mode there is in fact one normalisable fermionic zero mode. We further note that \pairing\ implies that the metrics \metm\ and \fermet\ are equal, consistent with the unbroken supersymmetry.  At this stage we have shown that the fermionic zero modes satisfying $\Gamma\psi^\alpha=\psi^\alpha$ are paired with the bosonic zero modes. In principle there could other fermionic zero modes and one would need a kind of index argument to determine whether or not they are present. Although we do not have a general proof that there are not additional fermionic zero modes, we do not expect them. In all supersymmetric models that we know of where there is a corresponding index theorem, a simple counting argument shows that all of the bosonic and fermionic zero modes are paired by the unbroken supersymmetry.  The construction of the effective action describing the low energy dynamics now proceeds by a collective co-ordinate expansion. For each normalisable zero mode, we introduce a collective co-ordinate. For the bosonic zero modes this amounts to allowing the moduli associated with finite norm zero modes to depend on time For the fermionic zero modes we use \pairing\ to introduce the collective co-ordinates in a way that preserves the unbroken supersymmetry. Specifically, we are led to the following low-energy ansatz for the time varying fields $$ \eqalign{{ \phi^\alpha(t,z)&=\phi_o^\alpha(z,X^p(t))+\dots\cr \psi^\alpha(t,z)&=\delta_p\phi^\alpha\epsilon^p(t)+\dots\cr } \eqn\ansatz $$ where $\epsilon^p$ is now a Grassmann odd spinor satisfying $\Gamma\epsilon^p=\epsilon^p$ and the neglected terms correspond to non-zero modes. This expansion corresponds to a change of variables from $\phi$ and $\psi$ to their infinite mode expansions and the low-energy approximation is imposed by neglecting all but the zero modes. After substituting the ansatz \ansatz\ into the action \susysig\ and exploiting the fact that the moduli space $\tilde M_N$ is K\"ahler, we obtain the following effective action describing the low-energy dynamics: $$ S_{{\rm eff}=\int dt\CG_{{p\bar q}\left\{{{{\dot X}^p \dot{{\bar X}^{{\bar q} +i\lambda^p D_t\lambda^{{\bar q}\right\} \eqn\seff $$ where $\epsilon^p\equiv{{1\over \sqrt 2}\left( \matrix{{\lambda^p\cr -i\lambda^p\cr} \right)$ and the covariant derivative is defined using the pullback of the Christoffel connection $\gamma$ on the moduli space: $$ D_t\lambda^{{\bar p}=\dot\lambda^{{\bar p}+ {{\gamma^{{\bar p}}_{{ {{\bar q}{{\bar r}} \dot{{\bar X}^{{\bar q}\lambda^{{\bar r} \qquad.\eqn\covdt $$ The action can be recast into a slightly more familiar form using real co-ordinates: $$ S_{{\rm eff}={{1\over 2}\int dt\CG_{{ab}\left\{{{{\dot X}^a \dot{{\bar X}^b +i\lambda^a D_t\lambda^b\right\}\qquad. \eqn\seffr $$ This action is a variation of the usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics action. Usually, the fermions are two component Majorana spinors that transform as real vectors on the target. In the present case the $\lambda^a$ are a set of one component Grassmann odd objects that transform as real vectors on the target. This fact and the ansatz \ansatz\ resolve the apparent contradiction discussed in the conclusion of [\ruback].  The unbroken supersymmetry of the underlying sigma model provides an N=2 supersymmetry of \seff\ i.e. there exist two one component anti-commuting supercharges \foot{{On a general manifold the action \seffr\ is sometimes called an $N={{1\over 2}$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In the present context where we have two $N={{1\over 2}$ supersymmetries the nomenclature is clearly clumsy.}. To show this we define the unbroken supersymmetry parameter by $\sigma={{1\over \sqrt 2} \left(\matrix{{i\kappa\cr -\kappa\cr}\right)$, satisfying $\Gamma^*\sigma=\sigma$, and using \onesusy,\twosusy,\spdec\ and \ansatz\ we deduce that $$ \eqalign{{\delta X^p&=i\kappa\lambda^p\cr \delta\lambda^p&=-\dot X^p\kappa^*\qquad.\cr} \eqn\susy $$ The supersymmetry charges can be derived using Noether's theorem and we find $$ \eqalign{{ Q&=\CG_{{p{{\bar q}}{{\dot X}^{{\bar q}\lambda^p\cr Q^*&=\CG_{{p{{\bar q}}{{\dot X}^{{p}\lambda^{{\bar q}\qquad.\cr} \eqn\charges $$ Thus the effective action describing the low energy dynamics of a set of N supersymmetric solitons is given by an N=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics with the moduli space of N static solutions as a target manifold.  It will be useful in the following to know how the angular momentum operator of the sigma model depends on the zero modes. This could be derived by first calculating the angular momentum operator of the sigma model and then substituting \ansatz. A more direct way is the following. We first define the two supersymmetry charges of the sigma model via $$ \delta\phi^i=(i\bep^1Q^1+i\bep^2Q^2)\phi^i\qquad. \eqn\th $$ Using \onesusy\ and \twosusy\ a short calculation shows that up to a factor the supersymmetry charge $Q$ in \charges\ corresponds to the following linear combination of the components of the sigma model supersymmetry charges defined in \th: $$ Q={{1\over 2}\left[Q^1_1+Q^2_2+i(Q^1_2-Q^2_1)\right] \qquad. \eqn\fr $$ In [\claudia] it was shown that the d=2+1 superPoincare algebra implies $$ [J,Q]=-{{1\over 2}Q\qquad [J,Q^*]={{1\over 2} \eqn\frog $$ where $J\equiv M_{{12}$ is the angular momentum generator in d=2+1. After carrying out a canonical analysis of \seff\ we can construct the zero mode contribution to $J$ by demanding that it satisfies \frog\ and commutes with the effective Hamiltonian. This is done in the next section.  Before concluding this section, we note that the consistency condition for the existence of the N=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics is that the moduli space of static solutions be K\"ahler, as indeed it is. It is tempting to suggest that this logic can be reversed; that the K\"ahler nature of the moduli space can be deduced from the presence of the unbroken supersymmetry. This connection could be a general feature of field theories with Bogomol'nyi bounds, as they all have unbroken supersymmetry and the moduli spaces of static solutions are K\"ahler and hyperK\"ahler in the situations when we expect N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics, respectively. It is possible that this connection is just a formal one and not a substitute for hard analysis.  \chapter{{Quantisation of the Effective Action} To further pursue the analysis of the low energy dynamics of the supersymmetric lumps, one needs to quantize the effective action \seff. We will see that additional information from the parent field theory is still required to resolve some ambiguities in the quantisation procedure. As we mentioned in the introduction, the quantum mechanics of the effective action describes the dynamics of the full field theory assuming that all but the zero modes are in the ground state.  To simplify the discussion we will discuss the quantisation in the context of the $CP^1$ sigma model. The moduli space $M_N$ for this target consists of all rational functions of degree $N$. The most general one lump solution is given by $$ \phi_o=\alpha+\beta(z+\gamma)^{{-1}\eqn\chgone $$ where the moduli $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are arbitrary complex numbers. Only the modular parameter $\gamma$ is associated to a zero mode of finite norm, so only $\gamma$ is allowed to be time dependent in \ansatz. Fixing $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the reduced moduli space $\tilde M_N$ for one lump is two dimensional with a flat metric and $\gamma$ can be interpreted as the location of the soliton in the plane. For this case $M_N$ is simply the orbit space of the isometries induced by translations in $R^2$.  The effective action \seff\ is thus an N=2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics based on $R^2$. We can rewrite it in hamiltonian form as $$ S_{{eff}=\int dt \left\{{P_a\dot X^a+{{im\over 2}\lambda^a\dot\lambda^b\delta _{{ab}-{{P^2\over 2m}\right\}\eqn\effone $$ where $a,b=1,2$ and the mass of the lumps $m$ has been defined via $\CG_{{ab}=m\delta_{{ab}$. In complex co-ordinates the supersymmetry charges \charges\ are given by $$ Q=\lambda P\qquad Q^*=\lambda^* P^*\qquad. \eqn\susyone $$ The non-vanishing canonical quantum commutation relations can be read off directly from \effone, viz $$ [X^a,P_b]=i\delta^a_b\qquad \{{\lambda,\lambda^*\}=m^{{-1} \eqn\comone $$ where here and in the following we set $\hbar=1$. Defining a state $\vac$ satisfying $\lambda\vac=0$, the Hilbert space consists of two types of states: $\vac f(X)$ and $\lambda^*\vac g(X)$. The momentum operator is realised on these states in the usual way: $P_a=-i {{\partial\over\partial X^a}$. The Hamiltonian is constructed using the supersymmetry algebra: $$ H=\{{Q,Q^*\}={{P^2\over 2m} \eqn\hamilo $$  The operator given by $$ S=-{{1\over 2}\lambda\lambda^* \eqn\J $$ clearly commutes with the Hamiltonian \hamilo\ and satisfies \frog. Thus we can interpret it as the semiclassical spin operator in the one-lump sector. Noting that $$ [S,\lambda]=-{{1\over 2}\lambda\qquad [S,\lambda^*]={{1\over 2}\lambda^* \qquad.\eqn\qj $$ we deduce that the spin of the two types of states differ by a half and that the Hilbert space consists of a d=2+1 supermultiplet. An alternative way to arrive at this conclusion would be to use the arguments developed in [\claudia] to show that the N=2 superparticle in d=2+1 is a more accurate description of the dynamics of a single supersymmetric lump since it posesses all of the appropriate symmetries: broken symmetries are non-linearly realised and unbroken symmetries are linearly realised. In fact \effone\ is a gauged fixed version of this superparticle action. The quantisation of superparticle actions naturally leads to supermultiplets. A more sophisticated analysis is required to determine the exact spin content of the spectrum. It is natural to expect that there is one boson and one fermion state and that an anyonic supermultiplet could be arrived at if one included a Hopf term in the sigma-model action.  We now turn to a discussion of the quantisation in the multi-lump sectors. Because of the translation invariance of the underlying filed theory, the moduli space $\tilde M_N$ will factorise into a flat piece and a non-trivial piece $\tilde M_N^0$ [\ward]. The flat piece corresponds to the centre of mass motion, the orbit space of the translations, and its quantisation is the same as for the one lump case leading to a d=2+1 supermultiplet. The quantum states of \seff\ are then obtained as a tensor product of these states and those coming from the quantisation of the non-trivial piece. Thus the non-trivial aspect of the dynamics concerns quantising on the non-trivial part of the moduli space so we now turn to a discussion of this.  We want to quantise the action \seff\ on an arbitrary K\"ahler manifold $\tilde M_N^0$. The quantisation of the action \seff\ on an arbitrary compact manifold has been considered in [\alva,\friedan]. It was shown that a natural way of quantising the system leads to a Hilbert space of states consisting of spinors on the target space (assuming the target admits a spin structure). In the present case, where the target space is K\"ahler we will show that an equally natural quantisation procedure leads to a Hilbert space of states consisting of the anti-holomorphic forms on the target. The difference between the two quantisations is due to an operator ordering ambiguity in the transition from classical to quantum mechanics\foot{{If the moduli space were a Calabi-Yau manifold then these two quantisations would be equivalent.}. The operator ordering can be determined by demanding that the operator ordering of the zero modes is consistent with the operator ordering of the parent field theory in the vaccuum sector. In the appendix we show that an operator ordering of the sigma-model consistent with the ordering adopted in [\wittent] to calculate the Witten index of the theory, leads to an ordering producing the Hilbert space of anti-holomorphic froms on the target.  We now show how this quantisation procedure works. The quantisation of \seff\ is facilitated by introducing tangent space indices. Since a K\"ahler manifold has $U(N)$ holonomy, we can introduce a basis of one forms $\{{e^A_p,e^{{\bar A}_{{\bar p}\}$ satisfying $$ \CG_{{p\bar q}=e^A_pe^{{\bar B}_{{\bar q}\delta_{{A\bar B} \eqn\frame $$ with $(e^A_p)^*=e^{{\bar A}_{{\bar p}$. Furthermore the nonvanishing components of the spin connection can be chosen to take the form $$ \eqalign{{ {{{{\omega_p}^A}_B&=e^A_q({{E^q_B,}_p+{{\gamma^q}_{{pr}E^r_B) \qquad and \qquad c.c.\cr {{{{\omega_{{\bar p}}^A}_B&=e^A_q{{E^q_B,}_{{\bar p}\qquad \qquad\qquad and \qquad c.c.\cr} \eqn\spincon $$ where we have introduced $E^p_A$ satisying $e^A_pE^p_B=\delta^A_B$, $e^A_pE^q_A=\delta^q_p$ and $``c.c"$ denotes the complex conjugates. Using these definitions we can rewrite the action \seff\ in the form $$ S=\int dt \left\{{\CG_{{p\bar q}\dot X^p\dot X^{{\bar q}+i\lambda^A D_t\lambda ^{{\bar B}\delta_{{A\bar B}\right\} \eqn\sefftangent $$ where the covariant derivative is now defined using the pullback of the spin connection from the target to the worldline.  The canonical momenta are given by $$ \eqalign{{ P_p&=\CG_{{p{{\bar q}}\dot X^{{\bar q} +i\lambda^A\lambda^{{\bar B} \omega_{{pA{{\bar B}}\qquad and \qquad c.c.\cr \CP_{{A}&={{\delta L\over \delta \lambda^{{A}}= 0\cr \CP_{{\bar B}&={{\delta L\over \delta \lambda^{{\bar B}}= -i\lambda^A\delta_{{A{{\bar B}}\qquad.\cr} \eqn\mom $$ The definition of the momenta conjugate to the fermionic variables neccesarily contain second class constraints. These can be eliminated by replacing the following non-zero graded Poisson brackets $$ \{{X^p,P_q\}_{{\rm pb}=\delta^p_q\qquad \{{\lambda^p,\CP_q\}_{{\rm pb} =-\delta^p_q\qquad and \qquad c.c. \eqn\pois $$ by Dirac brackets. To canonically quantise one then replaces the (graded) Dirac brackets by (graded) commutators via $\{{\ ,\ \}_{{DB}\to -i[\ ,\ ]$. A short calculation shows that the non-zero commutators are given by $$ \eqalign{{ [X^p,P_q]&=i\delta^p_q\qquad and \qquad c.c.\cr \{{\lambda^A,\lambda^{{\bar B}\}&=\delta^{{A\bar B}\qquad.\cr} \eqn\com $$ The holomorphic and anti-holomorphic components of the fermions are thus raising and lowering opreators. Defining a state $\vac$ satisfying $\lambda^A\vac=0$ the Hilbert space consists of the following states: $$ \eqalign{{ \vert f> &=\lambda^{{\bar A_1}\dots\lambda^{{{{\bar A}_p}\vac {{1\over p!}f_{{{{\bar A}_1\dots{{\bar A}_p}(X)\cr &=\lambda^{{{{\bar p}_1}\dots\lambda^{{{{\bar p}_p}\vac {{1\over p!}f_{{{{\bar p}_1\dots{{\bar p}_p}(X)\qquad.\cr} \eqn\states $$ Acting on these states the bosonic momenta are realised in the usual way: $P_p=-i{{\p\over\p X^p}$ and $P_{{\bar p}=-i{{\p\over\p X^{{\bar p}}$. Thus the Hilbert space can be identified with the space of anti-holomorphic forms on the moduli space.  The natural inner product is given by the hermitean inner product of the differential forms. If $\vert f>$ and $\vert g>$ are two states corresponding to p-forms the inner product is given by $$ <f\vert g>={{1\over p!}\int dX d{{\bar X}\sqrt{{\CG}{{\bar f} ^{{{{\bar p}_1\dots{{\bar p}_p} g_{{{{\bar p}_1\dots{{\bar p}_p}\qquad. \eqn\inner $$ The inner product of two states corresponding to different rank forms is zero and the inner product of arbitrary states is obtained by linearity. We note here that using this inner product implies that $P_p^\dagger=P_{{\bar p}-i {{\gamma^{{\bar q}}_{{{{\bar p}{{\bar q}}$.  The supersymmetry charges are given by $$ \eqalign{{ Q&=\lambda^p\pi_p\cr Q^*&=Q^\dagger=\lambda^{{\bar p}\pi_{{\bar p}\cr} \eqn\susychges $$ where we have defined $$ \eqalign{{ \pi_p&=P_p+i\lambda^{{\bar B}\lambda^A\omega_{{pA{{\bar B}}\cr \pi_{{\bar p}&=P_{{\bar p}+i\lambda^{{\bar B}\lambda^A \omega_{{{{\bar p}A{{\bar B}}\qquad.\cr} \eqn\a $$ In defining the quantum supersymmetry charges we have made a definite choice of operator ordering. We argue in the appendix that this is consistent with a natural operator ordering choice in the full field theory.  To see how the supercharges act on the states, we first present the following useful commutation  relations: $$ \eqalign{{ \{{\lambda^p,\lambda^{{\bar q}\}&=\CG^{{p\bar q}\cr [\pi_p,\lambda^q]&=i{{\gamma^q}_{{pr}\lambda^r\qquad and \qquad c.c.\cr [\pi_p,\pi_{{\bar q}]&=-R_{{{{\bar r}sp{{\bar q}}\lambda^{{\bar r}\lambda ^s\qquad.\cr} \eqn\b $$ Using these it is straightforward to show that acting on the states \states, $\pi_p=-i\nabla_p$ and $\pi_{{\bar p}=-i\nabla_{{\bar p}$. A short calculation then shows that the supersymmetry charges act on the states as follows $$ \eqalign{{ Q^*\vert f> &=\lambda^{{{{\bar p}_1}\dots\lambda^{{{{\bar p}_{{p+1}}\vac {{-i\over p!}\nabla_{{[{{\bar p}_1} f_{{{{\bar p}_2\dots{{\bar p}_{{p+1}]}(X)\qquad.\cr Q\vert f> &=\lambda^{{{{\bar p}_1}\dots\lambda^{{{{\bar p}_{{p-1}}\vac {{-i\over (p-1)!}\nabla^{{\bar q}f_{{{{\bar q}{{\bar p}_1 \dots{{\bar p}_{{p-1}}(X)\qquad.\cr} \eqn\states $$ Thus we identify the supersymmetry charges as the anti-holomorphic exterior derivative and its adjoint: $$ \eqalign{{ Q^*&=-i{{\bar\p}\cr Q&=i{{\bar\p}^\dagger\cr} \eqn\c $$ where the adjoint is defined with respect to the inner product \inner\ (and thus is strictly only defined on normalisable states).  The quantum Hamiltonian is calculated using the supersymmetry algebra: $$ \eqalign{{ H&=\{{Q,Q^*\}\cr &={{\bar\p}^\dagger {{\bar\p}+{{\bar\p}{{\bar\p}^\dagger\cr &=\CG^{{p{{\bar q}}\pi_p\pi_{{\bar q}+ R_{{p{{\bar q}}\lambda^{{\bar q}\lambda^p\cr} \eqn\ham $$ On a K\"ahler manifold ${{\bar\p}^\dagger{{\bar\p}+{{\bar\p}{{\bar\p}^\dagger=$$ {{1\over 2}(dd^\dagger+d^\dagger d)$ is simply half the Laplacian acting on differential forms. The quantum problem can now be tackled in the usual manner. We look for energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian \ham, interpreting the normalisable wave functions as bound states and the non-normalisable ones as scattering states.  We first discuss the bound states. As we have noted a quantum state of the effective action corresponds to a state of the full sigma model field theory assuming that all but the zero modes are in their ground states. Hence, the bound states of the effective theory with lowest energy must correspond to bound states in the full theory as there are no states with lower energy into which they could decay. The other bound states could correspond to bound states of the full theory or possibly resonances, determining which seems a difficult problem.  Thus the normalisable states of lowest energy are an important class of states. Because the effective action is supersymmetric, the energy of the states are all greater than zero. If a state has zero energy then it must be annihilated by all the supersymmetry charges. In the present case this is equivalent to the state corresponding to a normalisable harmonic $(0,p)$ form on the moduli space $\tilde M_N^0$. That is, a non-trivial element $\bar\p$-cohomolgy class of the moduli space $\tilde M_N^0$ with the proviso that the state is normalisable. This proviso is neccessary since the space is non-compact.  We note that the spin of these states could be ascertained by constructing the angular momentum operator. The rotation invariance of the parent sigma model implies that the metric on $\tilde M_N^0$ is $SO(2)$ invariant. Thus there is a corresponding angular momentum operator of the effective theory that commutes with the Hamiltonian. Since the bound states have zero energy and hence zero orbital angular momentum, the angular momentum of the states is just the spin of the states.  The next stage in the analysis of the low-energy dynamics of the supersymmetric lumps would be to investigate the scattering states. This problem seems to require a rather detailed knowledge of the geometry of the moduli space. We note that one of the difficulties in pursuing the quantum mechanics further is that it will depend on which moduli space $\tilde M_N$ one is considering. Depending on how one fixes the moduli that are not allowed to vary in time one will obtain different geometries and possibly topologies and hence different quantum systems. It would be wise to investigate the quantum scattering in the purely bosonic case first, which has not yet been attempted.  \chapter{{Conclusions} In this paper we have initiated the investigation of the low-energy dynamics of solitons of supersymmetric field theories by presenting some detailed calculations within the context of a class of N=2 non-linear sigma models. We developed a number of techniques that can be applied to many other models. We conclude by summarising the important points. Generically, the solitons break half of the supersymmetry and the bosonic and fermionic zero modes form a multiplet with respect to the unbroken supersymmetry. This can be used to carry out a supersymmetric collective co-ordinate expansion and the low-energy effective action will be that of supersymmetric quantum mechanics based on the moduli space of static bosonic soliton solutions. The operator ordering ambiguities in the quantum theory can be reduced by demanding that the operator ordering in the soliton sectors be the same as that in the vaccuum sector. It seems likely that the Hilbert space of states will be isomorphic to some kind of differential forms on the moduli space. Bound states of zero energy will then correspond to normalisable harmonic forms on the moduli space and correspond to bound states in the spectrum of the parent field theory. Detailed calculations of the scattering theory of the effective action is an issue that we hope to report on in the future.  \ack {{I would like to thank Peter Bowcock, Peter Freund, Dan Waldram and in particular Jeff Harvey for valuable discussions and criticisms.

Demanding that observables be self adjoint operators and that the Hilbert space furnish a representation of any symmetry groups present constrains the operator ordering. In the semi-classical quantisation of theories with solitons a further constraint is that one must ensure that the operator ordering in the vaccuum sector is the same as that in the soliton sectors [\raj].  We will argue at a formal level at least that the operator ordering chosen in section 4 is consistent with a natural operator ordering in the canonical quantisation of the full supersymmetric sigma model \susysig. The operator ordering of the sigma model that we will use agrees with that chosen by Witten in [\wittent] to calculate the Witten index of the model.  Using the components of the spinor field $\psi^i_\alpha(x)$ we first define $$ \psi^i={{1\over \sqrt 2}(\psi^i_1+i\psi^i_2) \qquad \psi^{{*i}={{1\over \sqrt 2}(\psi^i_1-i\psi^i_2)\qquad \qquad. \eqn\bad $$ We next introduce an orthonormal basis of one forms on the target manifold of the sigma model $\{{e^P_j(\phi(x)\}$ and a spin connection defined by $$ {{{{\omega_i}^P}_Q(\phi(x))=e^P_j(\p_iE^j_Q+{{\Gamma^j}_{{ik}E^k_Q) \eqn\fred $$ where we have also introduced the inverse matrix $E^i_P(\phi(x)$. In terms of these variables the supersymmetric sigma model action \susysig\ can be written in the form $$ S=-{{1\over 2}\int d^3x\left\{{g_{{ij}\partial_m\phi^i\partial _n\phi^j\eta^{{mn} +i\psi^P\Ds\psi^{{*Q}\delta _{{PQ}+{{1\over 2}R_{{PQRS}\psi^{{*P}\psi^{{^*Q} \psi^R\psi^S\right\}\eqn\susysigt $$ where we have defined $\psi^P=e^P_i\psi^i$.  Considering \susysigt\ as a supersymmetric quantum mechanics based on the infinite dimensional target $\CC$, the canonical quantisation is now similar to the quantisation of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics discussed in section 4. Without presenting all the details, the non-vanishing equal time commutation relations are given by $$ \eqalign{{ [\phi^i(x),P_j(y)]&=i\delta^i_j\delta(x-y)\cr \{{\psi^P(x),\psi^{{*Q}(y)\}&=\delta^{{PQ}\delta(x-y)\cr} \eqn\etcc $$ where $P_i(x)$ is the momentum conjugate to $\phi^i(x)$. Defining a state $\vac$ satisfying $$ \psi^{{i}(x)\vac=0 \eqn\vaccuum $$ the Hilbert space consists of states of the form $$ \int dx^{{i_1}\dots dx^{{i_n} dF[\phi]_{{i_1\dots i_n}(x^{{i_1}\dots x^{{i_n}) \psi^{{i_1}(x^{{i_1})\dots\psi^{{i_n}(x^{{i_n})\vac \eqn\statey $$ which we can formally identify with the differential forms on $\CC$. The momentum operator is realised on these states as a functional derivative: $P_i(x)=-i{{\delta\over \delta\phi^i(x)}$.   The components of the supersymmetry charges are given by $$ \eqalign{{ \tilde Q&=\int d^2x \psi^i\Pi_i\qquad\qquad\qquad \tilde Q^*=\int d^2x\psi^{{*i}\Pi_i\cr S&=\int d^2x {{J_i}^j(\phi(x))\psi^i\Pi_j\qquad S^*=\int d^2x{{J_i}^j(\phi(x))\psi^{{*i}\Pi_j\cr} \eqn\bus $$ where we have defined $$ \Pi_i(x)=P_i(x)+i\omega_{{iPQ}\psi^{{*Q}\psi^P \eqn\car $$ In [\wittent] the quantisation of this model was considered in the zero momentum sector (fields independent of $x$) in order to calculate the Witten index of the model. It was shown that with a particular choice of operator ordering the quantisation led to a Hilbert space of states isomorphic to the differential forms on the target manifold of the sigma model and that the supersymmetry charges acted as the exterior derivative and its adjoint. It can be checked that the operator ordering we have chosen is consistent with that chosen in [\wittent].  Using the supersymmetry algebra to calculate the Hamiltonian we find $$ 2H=\{{\tilde Q,\tilde Q^*\} =\int d^2x\left({{1\over \sqrt g}\Pi_i{{\sqrt g}g^{{ij} \Pi_j + R_{{lkij}\psi^{{*i}\psi^j\psi^{{*k}\psi^l\right) \eqn\x $$ where we have used heavily the K\"ahler propert of $\CC$. We now want to truncate the theory to the zero-mode sector. We view the collective co-ordinate expansion \ansatz\ as change of co-ordinates on $\CC$ from the field $\phi^i(x)$ to its infinite mode expansion. Ignoring all but the collective co-ordinates will give us the desired operator ordering in the lump sectors. We first consider the kinetic term in \x. Formally it is the Laplacian acting on the differential forms on $\CC$. Since this is independent of the choice of co-ordinates on $\CC$ it truncates to the Laplacian acting on the differential forms on $\tilde M_N$. Thus after substituting \ansatz\ into the curvature term in \x\ we obtain the following truncated Hamiltonian $$ \eqalign{{ H&={{1\over 2}[{{1\over {{\sqrt{{\CG}}}\pi^a{{\sqrt{{\CG}}\CG^{{ab}\pi_b -R_{{{{\bar p}q{{\bar r}s}\lambda^{{\bar p}\lambda^q \lambda^{{\bar r}\lambda^s]\cr &=\CG^{{p{{\bar q}}\pi_p\pi_{{\bar q}+R_{{p{{\bar q}}\lambda^{{\bar q} \lambda^p\qquad.\cr} \eqn\hamt $$ Comparing with \ham\ we verify that the operator orderings agree.   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \refout \end \bye  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For arbitrary central extension of Lie algebra   explicit formulas of quantization are proposed. \end{{abstract}   {{\bf 1.} Well know that a structure of Poisson-Lie group          % PART1 on a vector space ( considered as a commutative group according to addition ) is defined by an arbitrary Poisson bracket  depending linearly on the coordinate functions, i.e.  by  a Lie algebra structure on an adjoint space. Quantization of  such Poisson bracket lead to the universal enveloping algebra of this Lie algebra \cite{{R}, and the commutativity of coproduct follows from the commutativity of  vector space. Therefore we can to attempt to deformate of  group structure on the vector space and in such way to obtain the noncommutative and noncocommutative Hopf algebras \cite{{D,FRT}. We have the following model example.    \\   {{\it Example}.  Consider on $R^{{3}$  the following  Poisson bracket \[ \{{ H,x \}=x \ , \ \{{ H,y \}=-y \ , \ \{{ x,y \}=\frac{{\sinh \gamma H}{{\gamma}, \ \ \gamma \neq  0 \  \ \mbox{{is parameter} . \]    This bracket has the  properties: \begin{{itemize}    \item The bracket  compatible with the following coproduct on    $C^{{\infty}(R^{{3})$ \\    $\Delta (x)=x \otimes \exp{{(\gamma H/2)}+ \exp{{( - \gamma H/2) }    \otimes x$, \\    $\Delta (y)=y \otimes \exp{{(\gamma H/2)}+ \exp{{( - \gamma    H/2)}    \otimes y $,  \ \    $\Delta (H)= H \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes H$, \\   which can be obtained from the group operation on $R^{{3}$:  \[ \left( \begin{{array}{{c} h \\ x \\ y \end{{array} \right) \ast    \left( \begin{{array}{{c} h' \\ x' \\ y' \end{{array} \right) =    \left( \begin{{array}{{c} h+h' \\ x \exp{{(\gamma h' /2)} + \exp{{( - \gamma h /2     y \exp{{(\gamma h' /2)} + \exp{{( - \gamma h /2)} y'   \end{{array} \right) \]   Hence,  $(R^{{3}, \ast )$ is the Poisson-Lie group   \cite{{D,WL}.   \item The simple substitution of this bracket by the commutator leads to the quantum $sl_{{q}(2)$. \end{{itemize}  In this paper we want to study the  method for finding of  such   Poisson-Lie groups structures on the vector spaces and  their   quantization.  {{\bf 2.} The simple way to obtain a structure noncommutative Lie group on a vector space is the consideration of  commutative extension of  commutative group. Let  {{\bf H}  and {{\bf V}    vector spaces,    and  $\rho_{{1} $ and $\rho_{{2}$   two commuting  representations of {{\bf H} ( as  the commutative Lie group ) on the space {{\bf V}    . Then we can introduce the following Lie group $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}=$({{\bf H$\oplus$V},$\ast$) , where  \begin{{equation} (h,v) \ast (h',v') = (h+h', \rho_{{1}(h)v' + \rho_{{2}(h')^{{-1} v)                                                                      \label{{gr} \end{{equation}  For this group the point (0,0) is the unit and  \[ (h,v)^{{-1}=(-h,- \rho_{{1} (-h) \rho_{{2} (h) v). \] The coproduct $\Delta$ , counit $\epsilon$ and the antipode $S$ on  $C^{{\infty}( \stackrel{{\sim}{{G})$  of the linear functions have the same form that the corresponding maps in \cite{{LM}. In \cite{{LM}  (cf. \cite{{GR}) was proposed to use  such coproduct for definition of  the deformation of the Lie algebra structure $\Im$    on the space ({{\bf H$\oplus$V}$)^{{\ast}$      , i.e. let $\Im$ is the Lie algebra, generated by $H^{{i}$ and $X^{{m}$ where $H^{{i}$ form the basis of an Abelian subalgebra. Write down the deformation of the product in $U(\Im )$     , which preserves ($\Delta,\epsilon, S $) :  \[   [x^{{r},x^{{s}]=[x^{{r},x^{{s}]_{{0} + \Phi ^{{rs}(H^{{k}; \rho_{{1},    \rho_{{2})    \]  Here $[x^{{r},x^{{s}]_{{0}$  is the initial composition and the deforming functions  $\Phi ^{{rs}(H^{{k}; \rho_{{1}, \rho_{{2})  $ are depended on $ \rho_{{1}, \rho_{{2}$ and are the power series of  $H^{{i}$ . The question of the possibility of  such deformation leads to the question of the possibility to define  a  Poisson-Lie structure  on the group  $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$    for which global Poisson bracket of the functions $\{{ h^{{i} \} $  is equal to zero and Poisson bracket of the coordinate functions  differs from the linear one only on the functions of  $\{{ h^{{i} \} $.       It will be good for the quantization of such system, because we have not the problem with ordering. Therefore we have the problem of the finding globally Poisson-Lie bracket on the group  $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$  from the cocycle  $\delta : g \rightarrow g \otimes g $, where  $g$ is the Lie algebra of $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$ and $\delta^{{\ast}$  is our \ $[.,.]_{{0}$ \ structure of Lie algebra on the space ({{\bf H$\oplus$V}$)^{{\ast}$ with $[h^{{i},h^{{j}]=0$ for all $i,j$. The group  $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$    topologically is  vector space and hence such Poisson bracket exists globally. The general analysis when such bracket   is linear + function of $\{{ h^{{i} \} $ will be done in a forthcoming paper.  In general case we have   \begin{{lemma} If we have the cocycle $\delta$ for which {{\bf $H^{{\ast}$ } is an Abelian subalgebra,  the global Poisson-Lie bracket  of the functions $\{{ h^{{i} \} $ on $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$ is equal  to  zero. \end{{lemma}  Now we are going to give the exposition of the method for finding  of global Poisson bracket on   $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$  from cocycle $\delta$  . After the change of variables $(h,v) \mapsto (h, \rho_{{2} (h) v)$ we obtain the group structure on $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$  without $\rho_{{2}$: \begin{{equation} (h,v) \bullet (h',v') = (h+h', \rho(h)v' + v)           \label{{grn} \end{{equation} wherein $\rho (h)= \rho_{{1} (h)   \rho_{{2} (h) $.  Note that the differential of the change in the  unit of $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$  is {{\bf Id}  , i.e. this change of variables does not change  of Lie bialgebra structure on  $g$. Further we work with  ($\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$,$\bullet$).  Let $h_{{\bullet}$     is infinitesimal version of $\rho$, i.e. $\rho (h)= \exp{{(h_{{\bullet})}$.  \begin{{lemma} For the Lie algebra $g$ of the group  (\ref{{grn}) ,   $g=H \oplus V$ with                       \\   $[h,h']=0, \ [v,v']=0, \ [h,v]=h_{{\bullet}v$. \end{{lemma}  For the Lie group $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$ the constant vector field $(h',0)$ is left-invariant for all $h' \in$H   and the constant vector field $(0,v')$        is right-invariant for all $v \in$V. If $\pi^{{ij}(h,v)$ is the Poisson-Lie bracket  of the coordina functions then from the Theorem 1.2 in \cite{{WL}  we have  \begin{{lemma} For all $k$ and $l$    tensor $\partial \pi / \partial h^{{k}$ is a left-invariant bivector field and $\partial \pi / \partial v^{{l}$ is a right-invariant bivector field on the group  $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$. \end{{lemma}  But $\left.(\partial \pi^{{ij} / \partial h^{{k}, \partial \pi^{{ij} / \partial v^{{l}) \right| _{{(0,0)}$ \    is our cocycle $\delta$. {{}From the Lemma 3 and the property that  $\pi (0,0)=0$         we can find globally  $\pi$      .    {{\it Example}. H and V are one-dimensions, $h_{{1}. v_{{1}=v_{{1}$. Then   $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$  is the   Poisson-Lie group with bracket  $\{{ h^{{1},v^{{1} \} = \alpha  v^{{1} + \beta (e^{{h^{{1}} - 1)$, \  $\alpha , \beta$ - parameters. The simple substitution of this bracket by the commutator leads to the quantum   Lie algebra $U_{{\alpha, \beta}$    generated by $h$ and $v$       with \[      [ h,v ] = \alpha  v + \beta (e^{{h} - 1),   \] \[     \Delta (h)= 1 \otimes h + h \otimes 1, \ \Delta(v)=e^{{h}      \otimes v + v \otimes 1 ,  \] \[     S(h)=-h, \ S(v)=e^{{-h} v,\ S(1)=1,\ \epsilon (h)=      \epsilon (v)=0, \epsilon(1)=1. \]   {{\bf 3.}  Consider an arbitrary central extension of Lie algebra. Let {{\bf V}=$\langle v^{{i} \rangle$ algebra Lie and $\langle h^{{1} \rangle  \oplus${{\bf V} its central-extension with cocycle $\Omega^{{ij}_{{0}$, i.e. \begin{{equation} [h^{{1},v]=0 \ \ \ \forall v \in V, \ \ [v^{{i},v^{{j}]= \Omega^{{ij}_{{0} h^{{1} + C^{{ij}_{{k} v^{{k},                  \label{{ext} \end{{equation} where $C^{{ij}_{{k}$ are the structuring constants of the Lie algebra {{\bf V} (here and below we assumed a summation on repeat indexes). Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two commuting differentiations of {{\bf V}. Then $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$= $\langle h_{{1} \rangle \oplus${{\bf V}$^\ast$ is the Poisson-Lie group with the product (\ref{{gr}) , where $\rho_{{1} (h_{{1})=e^{{\alpha^{{\ast}}$, $\rho_{{2} (h_{{1})=e^{{\beta^{{\ast}}$,  and with the cocycle adjoint to  (\ref{{ext}). On $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$  coproduct, counit and antipode  have the following form  \[ \Delta (h^{{1}) = h^{{1} \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes h^{{1},  \] \begin{{equation} \Delta (v^{{i}) = e^{{h^{{1} \otimes \alpha}(1 \otimes v^{{i}) +  e^{{- \beta \otimes h^{{1}}( v^{{i} \otimes 1),       \label{{copr} \end{{equation} \[  S(h^{{1})= - h^{{1},\ S(v^{{i})=- exp (-h^{{1} \alpha ) exp (h^{{1} \beta ) v^{{i} , \ \epsilon (h^{{1}) = \epsilon (v^{{i})=0  \]  \begin{{theorem} The global Poisson-Lie bracket on  $\stackrel{{\sim}{{G}$ with the cocycle adjoint to (\ref{{ext}) equals: \begin{{equation} \{{ h^{{1},v^{{j} \}=0 \ \ \ \forall j, \ \ \ \{{v^{{i},v^{{j} \} = \Omega^{{ij}(h^{{1}) + C^{{ij}_{{k} v^{{k} ,     \label{{osn} \end{{equation} where  \\         \\  $ \left| \left| \Omega^{{ij}(h^{{1}) \right| \right| =   $ \[       = exp(-h^{{1} \beta) \cdot \left( \int_{{0}^{{h^{{1}}         exp (h'(\alpha + \beta)) \cdot \| \Omega^{{ij}_{{0} \|         (exp (h'(\alpha + \beta)))^{{t}dh' \right) \cdot         (exp(-h^{{1} \beta))^{{t}  \]  \\  Here t is transposition of matrix and $\left| \left| \Omega^{{ij}  \right| \right|$ is a matrix with the entries of $\Omega^{{ij}$. \end{{theorem}  \begin{{theorem}  The simple substitution of this bracket  (\ref{{osn})   by the commutator leads the quantization of the algebra (\ref{{ext}), compatible with (\ref{{copr}). \end{{theorem}  From these Theorems we have the large class  of the quantum groups generated by   $h^{{1}$  and $v^{{i}$ \  with the relations (\ref{{osn}) and   ($\Delta , S   , \epsilon $)   from (\ref{{copr}). Example 1 from \cite{{LM} is a special case when {{\bf V}   is a  two-dimensional commutative Lie algebra.  In a forthcoming paper we shall describe in details the case of the Virasoro algebra.    \pagebreak  \begin{{thebibliography}{{99}                                        % REFERENCES  \bibitem{{D}  Drinfeld V G  1986 Quantum groups \newblock {{\it Proc. of the International Congress of Math.},            {{\bf vol 1} (Berkeley, CA: Academic) pp 798-820  \bibitem{{LM}  Lyakhovsky V and  Mudrov A 1992 \newblock {{\it J.

The main reason from the particle physics perspective is that such deformed spaces or symmetries could be the basis to construct field theories with improved ultraviolet properties. This hope was motivated from the fact that q-deformations of space-time seem to lead to some lattice pattern which in turn could serve at least as some kind of regularization built in a theory that would be  defined on such space-time.  Deformations of the Poincar\'e algebra (dPA) have been considered so far along three directions. The first consists of direct q-deformations of the Lorentz sub-algebra \cite{{1}--\cite{{3} along the lines prescribed by Drinfeld and Jimbo \cite{{11}. The second is based on the fact that the Poincar\'e algebra (PA) can be obtained by a Wigner-In\"{{o}n\"{{u} contraction of the simple anti-de Sitter algebra $O(3,2)$ \cite{{4,5}. Then one first constructs the q-deformed $O_q(3,2)$ using the Drinfeld-Jimbo method and then does the contraction.  In fact it was shown in ref.\cite{{8} that the same deformation can be obtained directly by considering general deformations of the commutation relations in the PA. Unfortunately the above deformations do not preserve the Lorentz algebra. Therefore it is natural to search for those dPAs that leave the Lorentz algebra unchanged in order to facilitate the quantization of the corresponding field theories. This motivation led us in ref.\cite{{10} to consider  a third direction, namely deformations of the PA that leave the Lorentz algebra invariant.  In the present paper we continue our search for the appropriate dPAs that will allow us to construct field theories with impoved ultraviolet properties. We demand that the dPAs,  in addition to leaving  the Lorentz algebra invariant and giving the ordinary PA in low energies,  should satisfy two more constraints. First, we require that there exists a tensor product of representations (coproduct) which is necessary in order to be able to go from the irreducible representations in the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics to the reducible representations in the Fock space of free quantum fields.  A second requirement is that the  representations of the dPA should be different from those of the  ordinary PA, a usual property in q-groups \cite{{13}, as a way to guarantee that the dPAs are well distinguished  from ordinary PA and, in  principle,  with  different physical implications. Finally we demonstrate using a scalar field theory defined on a specific dPA that indeed field theories with improved ultraviolet properties can be constructed.     \section{{The deformed Poincar\'e algebra} In ref.\cite{{10} it has been proposed to search for deformations of the PA that do not affect the Lorentz subalgebra.  The Lorentz algebra is a six-dimensional Lie algebra generated by the generators $J_i,\, K_i$ of rotations and boosts correspondingly satisfying the following commutation relations \begin{{eqnarray} {{}[J_i,J_j]&=&i \epsilon_{{ijk}J_k,  \nonumber \\ {{}[J_i,K_j]&=& i\epsilon_{{ijk} K_k,  \nonumber \\ {{}[K_i,K_j]&=& -i \epsilon_{{ijk}J_k . \end{{eqnarray} Recall that by defining \[ N_i=\frac{{1}{{2}(J_i+iK_i)\, \] one finds that $N_i$'s and $N_i^{{\dag}$'s satisfy an $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ algebra. The enlargement of the Lorentz algebra to the Poincar\'e by  including the energy-momentum generators $(P_0,P_i)$  was proposed  as a way to describe the quantum states of relativistic particles as unitary representations of the Poincare\'e group without using the wave equations \cite{{14}. One of the main points of ref.\cite{{10}was to show that this enlargement of the Lorentz algebra is not unique. Indeed, it was proposed to introduce a generalized set of commutation relations (as compared to the ordinary PA) for the generators $(P_0,P_i,K_i)$ as follows \begin{{eqnarray} {{}[K_i,P_0]&=&i \alpha_i(P_0,\vec{{P}), \nonumber \\ {{}[K_i,P_j]&=& i\beta_{{ij}(P_0,\vec{{P}) , \end{{eqnarray} where $\alpha_i,\beta_{{ij}$ are functions of $P_0$, $P_i$. Then applying the Jacobi identities on the sets $(J_i,K_i,P_0)$ and $(J_i,K_j,P_k)$ it was found that the general form of $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_{{ij}$ is \begin{{eqnarray} \alpha_i(P_0,\vec{{P})&=& \alpha(P_0,\vec{{P})P_i,  \nonumber \\ \beta_{{ij}(P_0,\vec{{P})&=& \beta(P_0,\vec{{P})\delta_{{ij}+\gamma(P_0,\vec{{P})P_iP_j .\end{{eqnarray} Assuming furthermore that there exists a Casimir invariant of the enlarged algebra of the form \begin{{equation} f(P_0)-\vec{{P}^2, \end{{equation} it was found that \begin{{eqnarray} \alpha_i(P_0,\vec{{P})&=&\alpha(P_0)P_i, \nonumber \\ \beta_{{ij}(P_0,\vec{{P})&=& \beta(P_0)\delta_{{ij} . \end{{eqnarray} Moreover the closure of the enlarged algebra required that \begin{{equation} \alpha(P_0)\beta^{{\prime}(P_0)=1 . \label{{1} \end{{equation}  In this way a minimally deformed Poincar\'e algebra was constructed with commutation relations \begin{{eqnarray} {{}[J_i,J_j]&=&i \epsilon_{{ijk}J_k,  \nonumber \\ {{} [J_i,K_j]&=& i\epsilon_{{ijk} K_k,  \nonumber \\ {{} [K_i,K_j]&=& -i \epsilon_{{ijk}J_k ,\nonumber \\ {{} [J_i,P_0]&=&0, \nonumber \\ {{} [J_i,P_j]&=& i\epsilon_{{ijk} P_k,  \nonumber \\ {{} [P_0,P_i]&=&0,  \nonumber \\ {{} [K_i,P_0]&=&i \alpha(P_0)P_i, \nonumber \\ {{}[K_i,P_j]&=& i\beta(P_0)\delta_{{ij} , \label{{c} \end{{eqnarray} where $\alpha(P_0),\beta(P_0)$ satisfy eq.(\ref{{1}).  Note that the ordinary PA is  obtained when $\alpha(P_0)=1$ and $\beta(P_0)=P_0$.  The above dPA has two Casimir invariants. One corresponds to the length of the Pauli-Lubanski four-vector \begin{{equation} W^2=W_0^2-\vec{{W}\cdot \vec{{W} , \end{{equation} where \begin{{eqnarray} W_0&=&\vec{{J}\cdot \vec{{P}, \nonumber \\ W_i&=&\beta(P_0)J_i+\epsilon_{{ijk}P_jK_k , \end{{eqnarray} with eigenvalues \[ W^2=-\mu^2 s(s+1), \] where $s=0,1/2,\ldots $ is the spin.  The other Casimir invariant of the dPA corresponds to the $(mass)^2$ of  the ordinary PA and it is given by \begin{{equation} \beta^2(P_0)-\vec{{P}\cdot \vec{{P} =\mu^2. \end{{equation} Let us also recall that the transformation $P_0\rightarrow \beta(P_0)$  reduces the dPA to the ordinary PA for the set of generators $(J_i,K_i,P_i, \beta(P_0))$.  \section{{Constraints on the dPA parameter functions} {{}From the construction of the dPA discussed above, it is clear that the functions $\beta(P_0)$ and,  consequently, $\alpha(P_0)$  are not specified. An obvious physical requirement that these functions should satisfy  is to  let us obtain the ordinary PA as a limit of the  dPA in low energies.  Therefore we require that the low energy behaviour  of $\beta(P_0)$ should be \[ \beta(P_0)\sim P_0 \] and therefore \[ \alpha(P_0)\sim 1 . \]  One of our main aims is to define  field theories  on the constructed dPA hopefully with improved ultraviolet  properties. A dPA with the Lorentz invariant subalgebra paves the way for an easy first quantization of such theories. Another  requirement for construction of field theories is to be able to define the multiparticle states. In field theories defined on the ordinary PA the multiparticle states are constructed from the tensor product of one particle states. Here therefore we are looking for the  corresponding "tensor" product which is usually called coproduct. In ref.\cite{{10} the $\beta(P_0)$ function was chosen to be \[ \beta(P_0)=M\sin(\frac{{P_0}{{M}) \] and the $P_0$ modulo periodicity was restricted to be in the interval $(-\frac{{\pi M}{{2},\frac{{\pi M}{{2})$. This was a first attempt to improve the ultraviolet behaviour of theories defined on the dPA  introducing an upper cut-off in the energy spectrum by choosing a bounded function $\beta(P_0)$. However, when considering the additivity properties of energy $P_0^{{(12)}$ of a system $S^{{(12)}$ composed  of two non-interacting systems $S^{{(1)},S^{{(2)}$ some problems were found. Specifically, although the energy is conserved the energy $P^{{(12)}$ was no longer the sum of the energies $P_0^{{(1)},P_0^{{(2)}$ of the two subsystems $S^{{(1)},S^{{(2)}$, respectively. So it was conjectured that the law of addition of the energies should be \[ %% FOLLOWING LINE CANNOT BE BROKEN BEFORE 80 CHAR \sin(\frac{{P_0^{{(1)}}{{M})+\sin(\frac{{P_0^{{(2)}}{{M})=2\sin(\frac{{P_0^{{(12)}}{{2M}) .\] The above conjecture, however,  does not correspond to  a true coproduct of the generator  $P_0$ \footnote {{We would like to thank  L. Alvarez-Gaum\'e and O. Ogievetsky for pointing this to us}.  On the other hand, the above choice of $\beta(P_0)$  has also a positive aspect in the sense  that the  transformation $P_0\rightarrow \beta(P_0)$ is not invertible since $\beta(P_0)$ is a multivalued function of $P_0$.  Here we would like to discuss two more alternatives as examples of the variety of existing possibilities. Let us first assume that the function $\beta(P_0)$  is of the form \begin{{equation} \beta(P_0)=M\tanh^{{-1}(\frac{{P_0}{{M}). \label{{tanh} \end{{equation} In this case the coproduct of the generators of the dPA are found to be \begin{{eqnarray} \Delta(J_i)&=&J_i\otimes 1+1\otimes J_i, \nonumber \\ \Delta(K_i)&=&K_i\otimes 1+1\otimes K_i, \nonumber \\ \Delta(P_i)&=&P_i\otimes 1+1\otimes P_i,\nonumber \\ \Delta(P_0)&=&(P_0\otimes 1+1\otimes P_0)(1\otimes 1+\frac{{P_0}{{M} \otimes \frac{{P_0}{{M})^{{-1}. \label{{co} \end{{eqnarray}  The coproduct (\ref{{co}) is determined by using the property that the transformation $P_0\rightarrow \beta(P_0)$ transforms the dPA to the ordinary PA, which in the present case is invertible. Then the knowledge of the coproduct $\Delta(P_0)$ within PA easily gives us the $\Delta(P_0)$ for the dPA. At this point it should be emphasized that with the present choice of $\beta(P_0)$ the dPA is not a trivial redefinition of the ordinary PA. The reason is that the function $\alpha(P_0)$ is given by \begin{{eqnarray} \alpha(P_0)=\frac{{1}{{\beta'(P_0)}=1-\frac{{P_0^2}{{M^2} . \end{{eqnarray} It is then clear that states with energy $P_0^2\geq M^2$  are not representations of the dPA since the action of the boosts $K_i$  on them would either leave unchanged or would reduce their energy. Therefore there is no one-to-one correspondence among the representations of dPA and PA as  would be in the case of a trivial redefinition.  As a second example let us assume that the function $\beta(P_0)$ is \begin{{equation} \beta(P_0)=M\tan^{{-1}(\frac{{P_0}{{M}) .  \label{{tan} \end{{equation} In this case again the coproduct is determined as before using the property that the transformation $P_0\rightarrow \beta(P_0)$ takes the dPA to ordinary PA which is again invertible.  The $\Delta(P_0)$ now  becomes \begin{{equation} \Delta(P_0)=(P_0\otimes 1+1\otimes P_0)(1\otimes 1-\frac{{P_0}{{M} \otimes \frac{{P_0}{{M})^{{-1}. \end{{equation}  Note however that the function $\alpha(P_0)$ now is \begin{{equation} \alpha(P_0)=1+\frac{{P_0^2}{{M^2} \end{{equation} and thus it  does not put any restrictions on the $P_0$'s.  Therefore there exists  a one-to-one correspondence among the dPA and PA.  \section{{Scalar field theory on dPA}  Here we shall examine a simple field theory such as $\lambda \phi^4$ on the dPA. The two examples for construction of multiparticle states  discussed above will be examined separately. Let us consider the ordinary $\phi^4$ in ordinary PA \cite{{15}.  The Lagrangian is \[ L=L_0+L_I \] with \[ L_0= \frac{{1}{{2}(\partial \phi_0)^2 -\frac{{\mu_0^2}{{2}\phi_0^2 \] and \[ L_I=-\frac{{\lambda_0}{{4!}\phi_0^4. \] Recall that the self-energy graph at 1-loop is given by \begin{{eqnarray} -\Sigma(p^2)=-\frac{{i\lambda_0}{{2}\int d^4\ell \frac{{i}{{\ell_0^2-\vec{{\ell}^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon} \end{{eqnarray}  and it is quadratically divergent. Also the vertex corrections at 1-loop are  given by \begin{{eqnarray} \Gamma(s)= (-\frac{{i\lambda_0}{{2})^2\int \frac{{d^4\ell}{{(2\pi)^4} \frac{{i}{{(\ell_0-p_0)^2-(\vec{{\ell}-\vec{{p})^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon} \frac{{i}{{\ell_0^2-\vec{{\ell}^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon} \end{{eqnarray} and  $\Gamma(t),\Gamma(u)$ have similar expressions where \[ s=p^2=(p_1+p_2)^2\, , \, t=(p_1-p_3)^2\, , \, u=(p_1-p_4)^2 \] are the Mandelstam variables. The vertex corrections diverge logarithmically. The divergences of the self-energy and vertex corrections are  removed by the well-known procedure of introducing counterterms and performing the renormalization program. We would like  to examine whether  the same theory when defined on the dPA has a better ultraviolet behaviour.  Given the form of $\beta(p_0)$ the $L_0$ part of the Lagrangian  can be expressed locally in  momentum space as \begin{{equation} L_0=\frac{{1}{{2}\left( \tilde\phi_0(p)(\beta^2(p_0)-\vec{{p}^2) \tilde\phi_0(p)- \mu_0^2\tilde\phi_0(p)\tilde\phi_0(p)\right), \end{{equation} where $\tilde\phi_0(p)$ is the Fourier transform of $\phi_0(x)$. Therefore the propagator in  the dPA is \[ \frac{{i}{{\beta^2(p_0)-\vec{{p}^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon}, \] which with an  appropriate choice of $\beta(p_0)$ can have  more convergent  behaviour for large $p_0$ as compared to the usual one \[ \frac{{i}{{p_0^2-\vec{{p}^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon}. \]  The calculation of 1-loop graphs reduces in determining integrals of the form \begin{{equation} I(p^2)=\int d^4\ell \beta^{{\prime}(\ell_0) f(\beta^2(\ell_0)-\vec{{\ell}^2 ,\beta^2(p_0)-\vec{{p}^2) \end{{equation} i.e., integrals with dPA-invariant measure. Let us start with the case that $\beta(P_0)$ has the form (\ref{{tanh}). In this case the integrals resulting from 1-loop corrections will be \begin{{eqnarray} I_1=\int_{{-M}^{{M} d\ell_0 \beta^{{\prime}(\ell_0) \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d^3\vec{{\ell}f(\beta^2(\ell_0)-\vec{{\ell}^2)\nonumber  \\ =\int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d\beta \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d^3\vec{{\ell}f(\beta^2-\vec{{\ell}^2) \end{{eqnarray} i.e., they are  exactly the same  as in  the ordinary PA case. Therefore the present form of $\beta(P_0)$ and the corresponding  dPA invariant measure does not improve the ultraviolet properties  of the 1-loop corrections to the theory.  Let us then turn to our second example which exhibits a different behaviour. In this case $\beta(P_0)$ is given by eq(\ref{{tan}). Then the integrals involved in the calculations of 1-loop corrections are \begin{{eqnarray} I_2=\int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d\ell_0 \beta^{{\prime}(\ell_0) \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d^3\vec{{\ell}f(\beta^2(\ell_0)-\vec{{\ell}^2) \\ =\int_{{-M}^{{M} d\beta \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d^3\vec{{\ell}f(\beta^2-\vec{{\ell}^2) , \end{{eqnarray} which are clearly more convergent (in view of the cut-off M) than the corresponding ones in the ordinary PA case. Therefore this choice of $\beta(P_0)$ provides us with an example of how one can improve the ultraviolet behaviour of a theory.  The negative aspect of this particular choice of $\beta(P_0)$  is that the corresponding dPA has representations in one-to-one correspondence with  ordinary PA and one would  obtain the same results just by  changing $P_0$ to $\beta(P_0)$ in ordinary PA. Therefore  this last example  cannot be considered  seriously as having physical consequences but rather should be viewed as a regulator of the theory.   \section{{A satisfactory model}  Here we present a choice of the function   $\beta(P_0)$ which  seems very promising since  it satisfies the two new constraints we have demanded so far. Namely there exists a  coproduct and the  representations  of the corresponding dPA are different from those of the ordinary PA. So we can construct a multiparticle state and the dPA under consideration is a distinct entity separate from the ordinary PA. Then in principle the theory defined on this dPA  could have different physical implications as compared to the same theory defined on ordinary PA. As we shall see,  the one-loop self-energy and vertex corrections of a scalar field theory defined on this dPA  has improved ultraviolet properties.  The chosen function is \begin{{equation} \beta(P_0)=M\sin^{{-1}(\frac{{P_0}{{M}). \label{{sin} \end{{equation}  The coproduct of the generators of the dPA are found to be \begin{{eqnarray} \Delta(J_i)&=&J_i\otimes 1+1\otimes J_i \nonumber \\ \Delta(K_i)&=&K_i\otimes 1+1\otimes K_i \nonumber \\ \Delta(P_i)&=&P_i\otimes 1+1\otimes P_i \nonumber \\ \Delta(P_0)&=&P_0\otimes \sqrt{{1-\frac{{P_0^2}{{M^2}} +\sqrt{{1-\frac{{P_0^2}{{M^2}}\otimes P_0. \end{{eqnarray}  As far as the representations  are concerned, recall that the closure of the algebra requires  that eq.(\ref{{1}) should  hold which in turn implies that \begin{{equation} \alpha(P_0)=\sqrt{{1-\frac{{P_0^2}{{M^2}}. \end{{equation} It is then  clear  that the representations with $P_0^2\geq M^2$  are necessarily non-unitary while   the energy spectrum for the unitary representations of the dPA  lies in the interval $(-M,M)$. Therefore, since there is no unitary representations describing physical states of the dPA with $P_0^2\geq M^2$, there is no one-to-one correspondence with the PA.  Turning  to the one-loop self-energy and vertex  corrections of the scalar theory we find that the self-energy graph  becomes now \begin{{eqnarray} -\Sigma(p^2)=-\frac{{i\lambda_0}{{2}\int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d^4\ell  \beta^{{\prime}(\ell_0)\frac {{i}{{\beta^2(\ell_0)-\vec{{\ell}^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon}\nonumber  \\ =-\frac{{i\lambda_0}{{2}\int_{{-M\pi/2}^{{M\pi/2} d\beta \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d^3\vec{{\ell} \frac{{i}{{\beta^2-\vec{{\ell}^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon} \end{{eqnarray} which is linearly divergent instead of quadratically in  the usual scalar  theory defined on  the ordinary PA. Correspondingly, the one-loop vertex corrections take the form \begin{{eqnarray} \Gamma(s)= (-\frac{{i\lambda_0}{{2})^2\int \frac{{d^4\ell}{{(2\pi)^4}  \beta^{{\prime}(\ell_0) \frac{{i}{{(\beta(\ell_0)-\beta(p_0))^2-(\vec{{\ell}-\vec{{p})^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon} \nonumber \\ \frac{{i}{{\beta^2(\ell_0)-\vec{{\ell}^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon}\nonumber  \\ =(-\frac{{i\lambda_0}{{2})^2\int_{{-M\pi/2}^{{M\pi/2}  \frac{{d\beta d^3\vec{{\ell}}{{(2\pi)^4}  \frac {{i}{{(\beta(\ell_0)-\beta(p_0))^2-(\vec{{\ell}-\vec{{p})^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon} \nonumber \\ \frac{{i}{{\beta^2(\ell_0)-\vec{{\ell}^2-\mu_0^2+i\epsilon} . \end{{eqnarray} and similar forms take the  $\Gamma(t),\Gamma(u)$ which  are all convergent.  \section{{Discussion}  The aim of the present paper was to present deformations of the Poincar\'e algebra that preserve the Lorentz sub-algebra requiring additional constraints that would pave the way for constructing realistic theories with improved ultraviolet properties. The new constraints that we have imposed are (i) the requirement of  the existence of  a coproduct of the representations of the dPA and (ii) the demand that there is no one-to-one correspondence among the representations of the dPA and ordinary PA which means that the two algebras are just homomorphic.   Concerning the first requirement, one may state, as a general rule, that a coproduct for the dPA always exists if $\beta(P_0)$ is an unbounded function of $P_0$. In that case, one may employ the homomorphism between the dPA and PA to pull back the coproduct of the  PA into the   dPA. Furthermore, if $\beta(P_0)$ is an odd function of $P_0$, the same homomorphism can also pull back the antipode of the  PA into the  dPA turning the latter into a cocommutative Hopf algebra. {{}From the physical point of view, the cocommutativity of the dPA guarantees that the addition of observables for two systems $S^{{(1)}$ and $S^{{(2)}$ is independent of the order of addition. Recall for comparison that in the case of  non-cocommutative algebras (quantum groups),  the addition depends on the order (i.e., on the ``labeling").  Turning to the second requirement it guarantees that the dPA is not a simple redefinition of ordinary PA.  Although the additional constraints  are necessary in order to construct a field theory on a dPA which is not a trivial redefinition of the ordinary PA  they do not guarantee that the theory has better ultraviolet behaviour. Therefore from this point of view they are necessary but not sufficient. On the other hand all the constraints considered so far, including the requirement  for improved ultraviolet behaviour, cannot restrict in an appreciable manner the choices of the functions $\beta(P_0)$ which differentiate the various dPAs from each other.  We should emphasize that when a dPA satisfying  all the above constraints is found it has very important physical consequences. First of all,  such a dPA will be characterized by a non-trivial function $\beta(P_0)$ which certainly will result in observable  deviations of the special theory of relativity.  There exist already some analyses \cite{{16,17} which put limits on the characteristic mass scale M appearing in general in $\beta(P_0)$ on dimensional grounds. For instance, according to ref.\cite{{17} the lowest bound consistent with experimental observations is $M_{{min}\simeq 10^{{12}$GeV.  Finally, a field theory with less divergences than the usual ones requires also  less counterterms to cure them. This in turn means that the theory will have less free parameters to be  fixed by experiment, or equivalently the theory will have more predictive power. It is expected  then that the phenomenological constraints will provide us with enough information to restrict the possible choices of the functions $\beta(P_0)$. Moreover, it is fair to hope that genuine predictions on unkown parameters would emerge as a result of the above construction.  \vspace{{1cm}  {{\bf Acknowledgement} \\  We would like to thank M.

The vectors    refer to the body-fixed system, ${{\bf L}$ being the  angular momentum, ${{\bf  \Omega }$  the instantaneous angular velocity, and ${{\bf M}$  the moments of the external forces. The dot denotes  differentiation with respect to the time $t$. % The unit basis vectors $\varepsilonb _i (i = 1,2,3)$  in B may be assumed to point along the eigenvectors of  the inertia tensor with respect to O. Then the angular moment ${{\bf L}$ has the components $ L_i = I_i  \Omega ^i $ (no sum over $i$). %  To describe also the translational  motion of the rigid body one usually chooses the point O to coincide with the center of mass  moving through space. The motion satisfies the   additional equations: % % \begin{{equation}  \dot{{\bf P} + {{\bf  \Omega }       \times {{\bf P} = {{\bf F} \label{{2}\end{{equation} % where ${{\bf P} = M{{\bf V}$ is the linear momentum, $M$ the body's total mass, ${{\bf V}$ the velocity of the center of mass, and ${{\bf F}$ the driving force. % Presently, the equations  (\ref{{1}) and (\ref{{2})  play an important role in missile dynamics analysis \cite{{4.}.  Usually, the two sets of  equations are derived as the  Newton equations  of motion in the {{\em  stationary\/}  reference system $S$: % % \begin{{eqnarray} & &\dot{{\bf l}  =  {{\bf m},\label{{3b}\\ & &       \dot{{\bf p}  = {{\bf f}.  \label{{3a} \end{{eqnarray} % Following general conventions, we  distinguish vectors and tensors in $S$ and $B$ by using for the small letters with Greek indexes and the  capital letters  with Latin indexes, respectively.  An transformation % \begin{{eqnarray}  \Omega ^i& = &e^i{{}_ \mu  \omega ^ \mu ,\label{{4}\\  V^i & = & \varepsilonb^i {{}_ \mu v^ \mu  \label{{4a}, \end{{eqnarray} % carries the of the angular and linear velocities $ \omega ^ \mu $ and $v^ \mu $ to the moving body-fixed system B  (see \cite{{1.} -- \cite{{6.}).  The $3 \times 3$ matrix elements  $e^i{{}_ \mu $ and $\varepsilon^i{{}_ \mu $   depend on the coordinates $q^ \mu $ in the system $S$. They satisfy  $ \partial_{{[ \nu } e^i{{}_{{ \mu ]}  \neq 0$, $\partial _{{[\nu} \varepsilon^i{{}_{{ \mu ]} \neq 0$, making the transformation (\ref{{4}) and (\ref{{4a}) {{\em anholonomic coordinate transformations\/}  (see \cite{{1.}--\cite{{arnold} for the general theory of the dynamics in anholonomic coordinates is presented).  Under the transformation (\ref{{4}), the equations (\ref{{3b}) go over into (1) and the additional term $ ({{\bf  \Omega } \times {{\bf L})^k =  \epsilon^k{{}_{{ij}  \Omega ^i L^j $ arises as the moment of the gyroscopic force. The additional term $({{\bf  \Omega } \times {{\bf P} )^k =  \epsilon^k{{} _{{ij}  \Omega ^i P^j$ in  equation  (\ref{{2})  arise similarly. Both terms are a consequence of the anholonomy of the transformation (\ref{{4}), (\ref{{4a}).  Within the stationary system $S$, Hamilton's action principle serves to derive the equations  of motion (\ref{{3b}) and  (\ref{{3a}).  If one transforms the classical action to the system $B$,  however, the description involves nonholonomic coordinates and a naive application of Hamilton's principle  produces  wrong equations of motion lacking the additional gyroscopic moments. In 1901, Poincar\'e showed \cite{{poinc} how to vary an action expressed in terms  of nonholonomic coordinates. Following his treatment, one certainly recovers the gyroscopic forces. His treatment is reviewed in the Textbook \cite{{arnold}.  The purpose of this note is to point out that  Poincar\'e's treatment may be viewed geometrically as an application of a recently proposed action principle in spaces with  curvature and torsion to the spinning top within the body-fixed reference system. The motivation for such a consideration derives from the fact that, in the literature on gravity with curvature and torsion \cite{{hehl} (for the  geometry of such spaces see \cite{{2.}), there is a widespread belief that in spaces with torsion, spinless particles move on shortest paths. However, it was discovered in Ref. \cite{{8.}  (when solving the path integral of the hydrogen atom) that the correct trajectories are the straightest paths in a given geometry. In Ref. \cite{{9.}, a classical action principle was found to comply with this physical fact.     The key to the new action principle is the observation, that a space ${{\rm M}_q$ with nonzero Riemann  curvature and torsion may be mapped locally into a euclidean space ${{\rm M}_x$ by an anholonomic transformation $\dot x^i = e^i{{}_\mu \dot q^\mu$ \cite{{7.}, \cite{{8.}. For the particle with mass $m$ in ${{\rm M}_x$, the equations of motion $\ddot x^i = 0$ yield straight-line trajectories. Under an anholonomic transformation, these lines go over into autoparallels satisfying the equation $\ddot q^\mu +  \Gamma _{{ \alpha  \beta }{{}^ \mu  \dot q^ \alpha \dot q^ \beta  = 0$ with  $\Gamma _{{  \alpha \beta } {{}^ \mu  = e_i{{}^ \mu  \partial _ \alpha e^i{{}_ \beta $ being the Cartan connection.    The orbits in the euclidean space ${{\rm M}_x$ may be derived from Hamilton's principle $ \delta A_x = 0$ applied to the classical action $A_x = \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} dt  \frac{{1}{{2}m \dot x^i \dot x^i$.  Under the anholonomic transformation $\dot x^i = e^i{{}_ \mu \dot q^\mu $, this action goes into the curvilinear form $ A_q = \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} dt \frac{{ 1}{{2}m g_{{ \mu  \nu } \dot q^ \mu \dot q^ \nu $. In the space ${{\rm M}_q$, a naive application of Hamilton's principle $ \delta A_q = 0$ produces  wrong equations of motion in the space $\rm{{ M}_q$. One finds $\ddot q^ \mu  + \bar  \Gamma _{{ \alpha \beta }{{} ^\mu \dot q^ \alpha  \dot q^ \beta  = 0$  which are the  equations for the geodesics rather than the autoparallels; they lack  torsion force $ 2m S_ \alpha {{}^ \mu {{}_ \beta  \dot q^ \alpha   \dot q^ \beta $.  The problem of describing the dynamics of a rigid body within the body-fixed frame may be formulated is somewhat analogous. Here the parameter space of Euler angles has a Riemann curvature. By going to the body-fixed frame and describing the system in terms of non-holonomic coordinates, the space becomes affine-flat but possesses torsion. The affine connection in the space of anholonomic coordinates. is obtained from the spatial derivatives of the transformation matrices in (5) and (6). The associated Cartan curvature tensor $R_{{  \mu  \nu  \lambda  }{{}^  \kappa \equiv e_i{{}^  \kappa (\partial _ \mu \partial _\nu - \partial_ \nu  \partial _  \mu ) e^i_ \lambda  $ vanishes, making the connection affine-flat.    The antisymmetric part of the connection  $S_{{ \alpha  \beta }{{}^ \gamma =  \frac{{1}{{2}( \Gamma _{{ \alpha  \beta }{{}^ \gamma -\Gamma _{{ \beta \alpha  }{{}^ \gamma ) $, which is a tensor, is nonzero giving rise to a nonvanishing Riemann curvature tensor  $\bar{{R}_{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda  }{{}^ \kappa   \neq 0$. The latter is formed from the Levi-Cevita connection, also called Christoffel symbol $\bar \Gamma _{{  \mu  \nu  \lambda  }= \frac{{1}{{2} \left(\partial _  \mu  g_{{ \nu  \lambda  }+  \partial _  \nu  g_{{ \mu  \lambda  }- \partial _  \lambda   g_{{ \mu  \nu  } \right)$, where $g_{{ \mu  \nu  } =   e^i{{}_  \mu   e^i{{}_  \nu  $ is the Riemann metric  in the space of anholonomic coordinates. %    We shall apply the variational principle of Ref. \cite{{9.} and derive, within the body-fixed reference system B, both the Euler equations (1) and  equations for the translational motion (2). \\[5mm] %%%%%% {{\bf 2)~The ${{\rm SO}(3)$ geometry in  a rotating   body-fixed system produced by an anholonomic transformation from the rest system}\\ %%%%%%%% Consider first a rigid body rotating around  a fixed point. Within  the body-fixed system B, we  introduce anholonomic coordinates  $ \Phi  ^i$ corresponding to the transformation  (\ref{{4}).  They are the components of the body's rotation vector in the axis-angle parametrization.  The anholonomic transformation  (\ref{{4}) defines their infinitesimal increments $ \dbar \Phi ^i =   \Omega ^i dt$. For a precise specification, let us go to the system $S$ where   the standard Euler angles $ \alpha =  \varphi ^3,  \beta =  \varphi ^2,~  \gamma  =  \varphi ^1$ [10] parametrize (holonomically)  the body's configuration space ${{\rm M}^{{(3 )}= {{\rm SO}(3)$. The components of the  angular velocity in the system B are $  \Omega ^1 = s_1 \dot\varphi^2 - c_1 s_2 \dot\varphi^3,~  \Omega ^2 = c_1 \dot\varphi^2 + s_1 s_2 \dot\varphi^3 , \Omega ^3 =   \dot\varphi^1 + c_2 \dot\varphi^3 $ 	 (with the short notation $c_ \mu  = \cos  \varphi ^ \mu ,~ s_ \mu  = \sin  \varphi ^ \mu $).

The metric  $ g = \left( g_{{ \alpha  \beta } \right) $ and its inverse  $ g^{{-1} = \left( g^{{ \alpha  \beta }\right) $ have the matrices % \begin{{equation}  g = \left( % \begin{{array}{{ccc}  1 & 0 & c_2\\  0 & 1 & 0 \\   c_2 & 0 & 1 \end{{array}\right), \,\,\, % % % g^{{-1}=\left( \begin{{array}{{ccc} 1 & 0 & -c_2\\ 0 & s_2{{}^2 & 0 \\ -c_2 & 0 & 1 \end{{array} % \right), \label{{x8}\end{{equation} % % where $|g| = \det  g = s_2{{}^2;~~~ g^{{-1} = |g|^{{-1}$ is the determinant of $g$. From $g$ we calculate the  Christoffel symbol: $$ \bar  \Gamma _{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda } =  - \frac{{  \sqrt{{|g|} }{{2} \left( \delta _{{1 \mu }     \delta _{{2 \nu } \delta _{{3 \lambda } +     \delta _{{1 \nu }  \delta _{{2 \mu }  \delta _{{3 \lambda }     +  \delta _{{1 \lambda }   \delta _{{2 \mu }      \delta _{{3 \nu } +   \delta _{{1 \lambda }        \delta _{{2 \nu }  \delta _{{3 \mu }       -  \delta _{{1 \mu }  \delta _{{2 \lambda }            \delta _{{3 \nu  } -  \delta _{{1 \nu }  \delta _{{2 \lambda }            \delta _{{3 \mu }\right). $$ % The associated Riemannian Ricci tensor is $\bar R_{{ \alpha  \beta } = \frac{{1}{{2} g_{{ \alpha  \beta }$ % % with a constant nonzero scalar Riemannian curvature  $\bar R = \lfrac{{3}{{2}$. The only nonzero components of the affine-flat Cartan connection are % \begin{{equation}    \Gamma _{{12}{{}^1 = ~~ \Gamma _{{23}{{}^3 =  \frac{{c_2}{{s_2},      ~~~\Gamma _{{12}{{}^3  = ~~~ \Gamma _{{23}{{}^1 = -\frac{{1}{{s_2},      ~~~  \Gamma _{{13}{{}^{{2} = s_2. \label{{9}\end{{equation} % From these we find the antisymmetric part is the torsion tensor $S_{{ \alpha  \beta  \gamma }    = - \frac{{1}{{2}  \sqrt{{|g|}  \epsilon _{{ \alpha  \beta  \gamma }$. %  A transforming to  the local basis $\varepsilonb^i$ yields the so-called object of anholonomy \cite{{1.}--\cite{{3.} % % % \begin{{equation}  2S_{{ijk} = 2e_i^ \alpha  e^ \beta _j e_k^ \mu  S_{{ \alpha  \beta  \gamma } \label{{10a}\end{{equation} % whose explicit form is % \begin{{equation} 2 S_{{ijk} = - \epsilon _{{ijk}, \label{{10}\end{{equation} % where $ \epsilon _{{ijk}$ denotes the Levi-Civita antisymmetric  tensor in Cartesian coordinates $( \epsilon _{{123}= 1)$ \cite{{2.}. This geometry prepares the ground for the  action principle to be developed. \newpage %\\[5mm] \noindent {{\bf 3)~Action    principle    for the rotational motion in the body-fixed $\mbox{{system B}$}\\ % Pure rotations around  an arbitrary fixed point of the body are governed  by  the Euler equations  (\ref{{1}). The kinetic energy is $T = \frac{{1}{{2} I_i  \Omega ^i  \Omega ^i$. In S, the  Lagrangian is $L_S = \frac{{1}{{2}    g^{{\rm kin}_{{ \mu  \nu } \dot \varphi ^ \mu \dot  \varphi ^\nu - U( \varphi )$  with $ U$ being the potential energy and $g^{{\rm kin}_{{ \mu  \nu }    = I_i  e^i{{}_ \mu  e^i{{}_\nu$ the ``kinetic-energy-metric". The  latter metric differs  from geometric metric  $g_{{ \mu  \nu }$ of Eq.~(\ref{{x8}).\footnote{{ Note that Einstein's summation convention is extended to include also diagonal components of the inertia tensor.} %  In this note, the   kinetic-energy-metric $g^{{\rm kin}_{{ \mu  \nu }$  \cite{{8.} will play no role. %  The potential term $U (\varphi)$ is irrelevant for our considerations  and will be dropped.  An application of Hamilton's action principle $ \delta A_S = 0$ to  the classical action $A_S = \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} L_S  dt$  in the system $S$ certainly yields the correct equations of motion. Under the transformation  (\ref{{4}), they become the Euler equations (\ref{{1}).  Let us now transform the action $A_S$ via (\ref{{4}) to the body-fixed system B. The result is very simple: % \begin{{equation} A_B =  \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} dt L_B = \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} dt \frac{{1}{{2} I_i \dot \Phi ^i        \dot \Phi ^i . \label{{11}\end{{equation} % By applying naively  Hamilton's action principle we would find the equations $I_i \ddot \Phi ^i = I_i \dot \Omega ^i = 0$ for each $i$ which are {{\em not\/} the correct Euler equations  (\ref{{1}) --- the gyroscopic moments being missed. % The contradiction is caused by the fact that the variations $ \delta \varphi ^\mu (t)$ in the space of Euler angles ${{\rm M}_ \varphi $ and the variations $\delta  \Phi ^i(t)$  in the space of anholonomic coordinates ${{\rm M}_ \Phi $, are related with each other %, 	   via an anholonomic transformation ,  in a path dependent way (``nonlocal" on the time axis) \cite{{9.}. Explicitly, there is the functional equation % \begin{{equation}    \Phi ^i_2 =  \Phi ^i_1 + \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} e^i{{}_ \mu 		  [ \varphi (t)] \dot  \varphi ^\mu (t) dt. \label{{12}\end{{equation} % Its most important consequence is that  closed paths in the space ${{\rm M}_ \varphi $ are not  mapped into  closed paths in the space ${{\rm M}_ \Phi $,   due to a nonvanishing Burgers vector $b^i = \oint e^i{{}_\mu   d \varphi ^\mu \neq 0$.  The usual Hamilton action principle in the system $S$ proceeds by considering a variation $ \delta  \varphi ^\mu(t)  = \bar \varphi ^\mu (t) -  \varphi^\mu (t)$ between two paths $\bar  \varphi ^\mu (t),~ \varphi ^\mu (t)$   $(t \in [t_1, t_2 ])$     with common  ends: $\bar  \varphi ^\mu (t_{{1,2}) =  \varphi ^\mu    (t_{{1,2})$. Together, they form a {{\em closed\/}    path in the space ${{\rm M}_ \varphi $. The above naive   application of Hamilton's action principle in the system B employed analogous closed-path  variations $ \delta  \Phi ^i(t) = \bar  \Phi ^i (t) -  \Phi ^i (t)$ between two paths $\bar    \Phi ^i (t),  \Phi ^i (t)$  $(t \in [t_1, t_2])$, with also  common ends: $\bar  \Phi ^i (t_{{1,2}) =  \Phi ^i (t_{{1,2})$. This, however, cannot be correct. Under a transformation  (\ref{{4}), variations $ \delta  \varphi ^\mu$ do  {{\em not\/}  produce closed-path variations $ \delta  \Phi ^i$ in the space ${{\rm M}_ \Phi $. The nonzero Burgers vector $ {{ b}^i\neq 0$ of the anholonomy causes a closure failure. This has to be accounted for in a correct derivation of the equations of motion.  The anholonomy of the transformation (\ref{{4})  requires distinguishing two types of variations of the paths  in the space ${{\rm M }_ \Phi$: closed path variations $ \delta  \Phi ^i (t)$ of the tpye described above, and {{\em anholonomic\/} variations $\deltabar  \Phi ^i (t)$,  which are images of the $ \delta  \varphi ^\mu (t)$ variations in the space ${{\rm M}_ \varphi $. Only the latter will  produce the correct equations of motion from an action principle in the system B.  To calculate the variation  of the classical action in the system B we derive the following simple formula for the  anholonomic variation $ \deltabar \dot \Phi ^i$ of the angular velocity $ \Omega ^i = \dot  \Phi   ^i$: % \begin{{equation}  \deltabar \dot \Phi ^i = \frac{{d}{{dt} 			    \delta \Phi^i 			  + \epsilon^i{{}_{{jk} \dot  \Phi^j 			     \delta \Phi^k \label{{13}\end{{equation} % (corresponding to formula (9) in Ref.\ \cite{{9.}).  Indeed, the transformation (\ref{{4}) and the definition  (\ref{{5}) lead to the equation % \begin{{equation}  \deltabar  \dot \Phi  ^i =  \delta (e^i{{}_ \mu  \dot \varphi ^ \mu )      = e^i{{}_ \mu   \delta  \dot \varphi ^ \mu  +  \partial _ \nu 	e^i{{}_ \mu \dot \varphi ^ \mu   \delta  \varphi ^ \nu  = 	\frac{{d}{{dt} \left(e^i{{}_ \mu  \delta  \varphi ^ \mu  \right) 	 + \left( \partial _ \mu e^i{{}_ \nu -  \partial _ \nu           e^i{{}_ \mu  \right) \dot \varphi ^ \nu   \delta \varphi ^ \mu \label{{14a}\end{{equation} which by (\ref{{10a}) becomes   %  \begin{{equation} \deltabar\Phi^i = \frac{{d}{{dt}   \delta \Phi^i 	+ 2 S_{{kj}{{}^{{i} \dot\Phi^j   \delta \Phi^k \label{{}\end{{equation} % % leading to (\ref{{13}) via (\ref{{10}). The variations $ \delta \varphi^ \mu $ are still performed   in the  system S. They can be mapped {{\em locally\/} into   holonomic closed-path variations $ \delta  \Phi^i$ in the system B by   $ \delta \Phi^i = e^i{{}_ \mu   \delta \varphi^ \mu $.    They have the fixed-endpoint property $ \delta \Phi^i (t_{{1,2}) = 0$,   reflecting the closed-path condition  $ \delta   \varphi^ \mu (t_{{1,2}) = 0$  in the system S.  Let us emphasize that our final   nonholonomic variations (15)  are completely intrinsic to the system B. % Applying these to the action $A_B$, an  integration by parts  with the boundary  conditions $ \delta  \Phi ^i  (t_{{1,2})    = 0$ leads to % \begin{{equation} \deltabar A_B  = \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} dt I_i    \dot\Phi^i \deltabar \Phi^i = - \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1}    dt  \delta \Phi^i (\dot{{\bf L} + {{\bf  \Omega }    \times {{\bf L})^i \label{{}\end{{equation} % Since $ \delta \Phi^i $   are now ordinary (holonomic) variations,  we find the Euler equations (1). % %\begin{{equation} % \frac{{\deltabar A_B}{{ \delta \Phi^i} %    = - \left({{\bf L} +{{\bf  \Omega } %        {{\bf L} \right)_i %\label{{14}\end{{equation} % Thus  the anholonomic action principle % \begin{{equation}  \deltabar A_B = 0 \label{{15}\end{{equation} %  produces the correct equations of motion  in the  body-fixed system B. \\[5mm] {{\bf 4)~Action principle for general motion    in the body-fixed $\mbox{{system B}$}\\ %%%%%%%%%%% To extend the action principle to the  general motion of a rigid   body one usually chooses the point O in B to be the  center of mass  of the body and studies the movements of O  and  rotations around O. Then $I_j$ are the body's principal  moments of inertia. The configuration space is a 6-dimensional manifold  ${{\rm M}^{{(6)} = R^{{(3)} \times {{\rm SO}(3)$ and the kinetic  energy  $T = T_{{\rm trans} + T_{{\rm rot}$ consists of two terms:  The first is the translational kinetic energy $T_{{\rm trans} = \frac{{1}{{2}M V^i V^i$ in the system B the second is    the rotational kinetic   energy $T_{{\rm rot} = \frac{{1}{{2} I_i  \Omega ^i \Omega ^i$ in the system B.   In the system $S$, the position and  orientation of the body are parametrized by the (holonomic) coordinates $ \left\{{  x ^ \mu , \varphi^ \mu \right\}_{{ \mu  = 1,2,3}   = \left\{{ q^M \right\}_{{M = 1,2, \dots 6}$, with $ x ^ \mu $ being the mass  center  coordinates and $\varphi^ \mu $ the Euler angles.  The body-fixed basis vectors in B (see Fig.~1) are some function of the Euler angles $\varepsilonb_i ( \varphi )$. Their components in the cartesian basis of the system $S$ are $\varepsilon_i{{}^\mu (\varphi)$. They form a $3 \times 3$ orthogonal matrix ${{\varepsilon}  (\varphi) = ({{\varepsilon}_i{{}^ \mu  ),~ {{\varepsilon}^{{-1} =({{\varepsilon}{{}^i{{}_ \mu) = {{\varepsilon}^T$. The components of the velocity of the center of mass in the system $S$ are $ v^ \mu = \dot x^ \mu $. The  components of $\dot x^ \mu $ with respect to the basis $\varepsilonb_i$    are $V^i = {{\varepsilon}^i{{}_ \mu  \dot x^ \mu $.  The last relation  permits us to introduce a new set of anholonomic coordinates $X^i$  describing  the center of mass motion in the system S as seen from the system B. By analogy with formula  (\ref{{5}), we define the infinitesimal increments $\dbar X^i$ as: % \begin{{equation}     \dbar X^i = \varepsilon^i{{}_\mu (\varphi) dx^ \mu . \label{{16}\end{{equation} % The set $\left\{{  X^i,  \Phi ^i \right\}_{{i =1,2,3}     = \left\{{ Q^I \right\}_{{I  = 1, \dots , 6}$ gives a complete set of an anholonomic coordinates for the configuration space ${{\rm R}^{{(3)} \times {{\rm SO}(3)$ of the moving  body.  Let us write down the anholonomic geometry of this space. Introducing   $6 \times 6$ matrices, whose rows and columns are labeled by capital Latin and Greek letters, % \begin{{equation} {{\cal E} = \left( % \begin{{array}{{cc}  e &  0\\    0 &  \varepsilon \end{{array} \right)  =  \left( {{\cal E}^I{{}_ \Lambda  \right),~~ {{\cal G} = %  \left( {{\cal G}_{{ \Lambda  \Sigma }\right)    =   {{\cal E}^T {{\cal E} = \left( % \begin{{array}{{cc}   g  & 0\\   0  & \hat 1 \end{{array} % \right) , \dots % \label{{}\end{{equation} % the geometry possesses the affine connection $  \Gamma _{{ \Lambda \Sigma}{{}^ \Delta  =    {{\cal E}_I{{}^ \Delta   \partial  _ \Lambda {{\cal E}^I{{}_ \Sigma $ with the torsion tensor $ S_{{ \Lambda  \Sigma }{{}^ \Delta  =  \Gamma _{{[ \Lambda  \Sigma ]}{{}^ \Delta \neq 0$ and a vanishing Cartan curvature tensor  $R_{{ \Lambda  \Sigma , \Delta }{{}^\Xi = 0$, implying an nonvanishing Riemann curvature tensor $  \bar R_{{ \Lambda  \Sigma , \Delta }{{}^\Xi \neq 0$. This geometry is a simple extension of the 3-dimensional anholonomic geometry on ${{\rm SO}(3)$ described in Section 2. It reflects the structure  of the present configuration space  $R^{{(3)} \times {{\rm SO}(3) $, i.e., the  space of configurations of the rigid body     comprising translations of the center of mass and rotations around it.  As a direct consequence of the definition (\ref{{16}), we have the relation $V^i =  \varepsilon^i{{}_ \mu  \dot  x ^ \mu  =  \dot X^i$  which, together with  (\ref{{5}), leads to the following simple form of the rigid body's Lagrangian in the system B:  % \begin{{equation}  L_B = \frac{{M}{{2} \dot X^i \dot X^i + \frac{{1}{{2}    I_i \dot \Phi ^i \dot  \Phi ^i. \label{{17}\end{{equation} %  As before, a naive application of  Hamiltons principle in the system B would produce a wrong equation $M \ddot X^i = 0$ for the motion of the center-of-mass. The correct anholonomic variation of the velocity % \begin{{equation}  \deltabar \dot X^i = \frac{{d}{{dt} ( \delta X^i) 	 + \varepsilon^i{{}_{{jk}  \left( \delta \Phi^j \dot X ^k            - \dot\Phi^j  \delta X^k \right). \label{{22}\end{{equation} % Indeed, the transformation  (\ref{{4a}) and the definition (\ref{{16})  lead to % % \begin{{equation}   \deltabar \dot X^i =  \delta (\varepsilon^i{{}_ \mu       \dot x^ \mu ) = \frac{{d}{{dt} ( \epsilon ^i{{}_ \mu         \delta x^ \mu ) + \partial _ \lambda  \epsilon ^i{{}_ \mu 	  (\dot x^ \mu  \delta \varphi^ \lambda - \dot\varphi^ \lambda 	      \delta x^ \mu ). \label{{23}\end{{equation} % The variations $ \delta x^ \mu $ may be mapped {{\em locally\/}   into holonomic closed-path variations $ \delta X^i   =  \varepsilon ^i{{}_ \mu  \delta x^ \mu $ in   the system B  with the property $ \delta X^i(t_{{1,2}) = 0$   reflecting the closed path condition $ \delta x^ \mu (t_{{1,2}) = 0$. Formula (23) follows using  the equations  $\dot x^ \mu = \varepsilon^ \mu {{}_k \dot X^k,~~  \delta  x^ \mu  = \varepsilon^ \mu {{}_k~ \delta X^k~~~ (\varepsilon^ \mu {{}_k \varepsilon^k{{}_\nu =  \delta ^ \mu _ \nu ),~  \dot\varphi^ \lambda  = e^ \lambda{{}_j  \dot\Phi^j,~~ \delta \varphi^ \lambda  = e^ \lambda {{}_j  \delta \Phi^j~~~ (e^ \lambda {{}_j e^j{{}_ \nu  =  \delta ^ \lambda _ \nu)_j$, and the relation $(d\varepsilon  \varepsilon^T)_{{ij} =   -\varepsilon_{{ijk} d\Phi^k$.  By applying the anholonomic variation (23) to the translational energy, we obtain %\begin{{equation} % \deltabar \dot X^i =  \delta ({{\varepsilon}^i{{}_ \mu  \dot x^ \mu ) %    = \frac{{d}{{dt} ({{\varepsilon}^i{{}_ \mu   \delta  x^ \mu ) %     + \partial _ \lambda {{\varepsilon}^i{{}_ \mu  \left(\dot x^ \mu %       \delta \varphi^ \lambda - \dot \varphi^ \lambda %      \delta  x ^ \mu  \right) %\label{{18}\end{{equation} % % \begin{{equation} \deltabar T_{{\rm trans} =  \frac{{d}{{dt} (M \dot X^i 		     \delta X^i) - M(\ddot X^i + \varepsilon^i{{}_{{jk} 	     \dot\Phi^j \dot X^k)  \delta X^i. \label{{19}\end{{equation} % % An integration by parts  using of the fixed-ends  conditions $ \delta  X ^ \mu (t_{{1,2}) = 0$ leads to the following expression for the total anholonomic variation of the action   $A_B = \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} L_B dt$: % % \begin{{eqnarray}    \deltabar A_B  & = & \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} dt ( 	I_i \dot\Phi^i \deltabar \dot\Phi + M \dot X^i 	  \deltabar \dot X^i) = \\ 	& = & - \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1} dt [ \delta \Phi^i 		({{\bf L}  + {{\bf  \Omega } \times 		{{\bf L})^i +  \delta X^i (\dot{{\bf P} 		  + {{\bf  \Omega } \times {{\bf P})^i] \label{{20}\end{{eqnarray} % % From the second term, we find the equations (2) for the translational motion. % %\begin{{equation} %  \frac{{\deltabar A_B}{{ \delta X^i} = - ({{\bf P} + %	  {{\bf  \Omega} \times {{\bf P})_i %\label{{}\end{{equation} % %which leads to equation Eq.~(2). \\[5mm] 5)~{{\bf Conclusion}\\ By subjecting the action $A_B$ in the body-fixed system to the new anholonomic variations with respect to  translational and rotational  degrees of freedom of the rigid body we have been  able to derive  both the correct  Euler equations (\ref{{1}) and the  equations (\ref{{2}) completely within the body-fixed  system without reference to the stationary systems.  The existence of such an action principle intrinsic to the body-fixed system  may  not  be only of aesthetic  value but may also  have  important practical consequences. ~\\                          ~\\~\\ Acknowledgement: \\ We are greateful to Dr. S.V.

The purpose of this note is to fill this gap.  \noindent 2)~Consider first  a relativistic free particle of mass $M$. If $x( \lambda )$ describes its orbit in $D$ spacetime dimensions in terms of some parameter $ \lambda $, the classical action reads % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.247} {{\cal A} _{{\rm cl}= Mc \int_{{\lambda _a}^{{\lambda _b}  d\lambda  \sqrt{{  x'{{} ^2 (\lambda )}, \end{{equation} % where $c$ is the light velocity. This action cannot be used to set up a path integral for the time evolution amplitude since it would not yield the well-known Green function of a Klein-Gordon field. An action which serves this purpose can be constructed with the help of an auxiliary fluctuating variable $ \rho ( \lambda )$ and reads \cite{{fh} % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.245} {{\cal A} = \int_{{\lambda  _a}^{{\lambda  _b} d\lambda \left[     \frac{{M}{{2\rho (\lambda  )}  x'{{} ^2 (\lambda  )     + \frac{{Mc^2 }{{2}\rho (\lambda  )\right] . \end{{eqnarray} % Classically, this action coincides with the original ${{\cal A}_{{\rm cl}$ since it is extremal for % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.246} \rho (\lambda ) =  \sqrt{{ x'{{}^2 (\lambda )} /c. \end{{equation} % Inserting this back into (\ref{{19.245}) we see that ${{\cal A}$ reduces to ${{\cal A}_{{\rm cl}$.   The action ${{\cal A} _{{\rm cl}$ is invariant under arbitrary reparametrizations % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.257} \lambda  & \rightarrow  & f(\lambda ). \end{{eqnarray} % The action ${{\cal A} $ shares this invariance, if $ \rho ( \lambda )$ is simultaneously  transformed as \begin{{equation} \label{{19.258} \rho  \rightarrow  \rho / f'. \end{{equation}  The  action  ${{\cal A} $  has the advantage of being quadratic in the orbital variable $x( \lambda )$.   If the physical time is analytically continued to imaginary values so that the metric becomes euclidean, the action looks like that of a nonrelativistic particle moving as a function of a pseudotime $ \lambda $ through a $D$-dimensional euclidean spacetime, with a mass depending on $ \lambda $. %*************************  \noindent 3)~ To set up a path integral, the action has to be pseudotime-sliced, say at $ \lambda _0= \lambda _a, \lambda _1,\dots, \lambda _{{N+1}= \lambda _b$.  If $ \epsilon _n= \lambda _n- \lambda _{{n-1}$ denotes the thickness of the $n$th slice, the sliced action reads  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.252} {{\cal A}^N = \sum_{{n=1}^{{N+1} \left[ \frac{{M}{{2\rho _n\epsilon _n} (\Delta  x _n)^2  + \frac{{Mc^2}{{2}\epsilon _n\rho _n           \right], \end{{eqnarray} % where  $ \rho _n\equiv  \rho ( \lambda _n)$,  $ \Delta x_n\equiv x_n-x_{{n-1}$, and $  x_n\equiv x( \lambda _n)$. A path integral $\int ({{\cal D}^Dx/ \sqrt{{ \rho }^D)e^{{-{{\cal A}/\hbar }$ may be defined as the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ of the product of integrals % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.251} \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{ 2\pi \hbar \epsilon _b\rho _b/M}^D} \prod _{{n=1}^{{N} \left[\int  \frac{{d^Dx_n}{{\sqrt{{ 2\pi \hbar        \epsilon _n \rho _n/M}^D}\right]        \exp \left( -\frac{{1}{{\hbar } {{\cal A}^N\right) , \end{{eqnarray} % This can immediately be evaluated, yielding % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.253} \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{ 2\pi \hbar L/Mc}^D} \exp \left[ -\frac{{Mc}{{2\hbar }      \frac{{( x _b- x _a)^2}{{L}      - \frac{{Mc}{{2\hbar }L \right] , \end{{eqnarray} % where the quantity \begin{{equation} \label{{19.254} \!\!\!\!\!L\equiv c \sum_{{n=1}^{{N+1} \epsilon _n \rho _n \end{{equation} % has the continuum limit % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.255} L =c \int_{{\lambda _a}^{{\lambda _b} d\lambda  \rho (\lambda ). \end{{equation} % Classically, this is the  reparametrization invariant  length of a path, as is obvious after inserting (\ref{{19.246}).  If the amplitude  (\ref{{19.253}) is multiplied by $ \lambda _C/2$, where $ \lambda _C=\hbar /Mc$ is the Compton wavelength of the particle, an integral over all positive $L$ yields the correct Klein-Gordon amplitude \begin{{eqnarray}    \left( {{ x}_b  \vert {{ x}_a  \right)            =\frac{{1}{{(2\pi )^{{D/2}}\left(  \frac{{Mc}{{ \hbar \sqrt{{ x^2}}\right) ^{{D/2-1} K_{{D/2-1} \left( {{Mc} \sqrt{{ x^2}/\hbar \right) , \label{{19.5}\end{{eqnarray} % where $K_\nu(z) $ is the modified Bessel function.  The result does not depend on the choice of $ \rho ( \lambda )$, this being  a manifestation of the reparametrization invariance. We may therefore write the continuum version of the path integral for the relativistic free particle as % \begin{{eqnarray}      \left( {{ x}_b\vert {{ x}_a \right) = \frac{{1}{{2}{{\lambda_{{\rm C}} \int^{{\infty} _{{0}     dL \int {{\cal D} \rho \Phi [\rho ] \int \frac{{{{\cal D}^D x}{{ \sqrt{{ \rho }^D}  e^{{-{{\cal A}}, \label{{19.1a}\end{{eqnarray} % where $\Phi [\rho ]$ denotes a convenient {{gauge-fixing functional}, for instance $\Phi [\rho ]=\delta [\rho -1]$ which fixes $\rho (\lambda )$  to unity everywhere.   To understand the factor $1/ \sqrt{{ \rho }^D$ in the measure of (\ref{{19.1a}), we make use of the canonical form of the action (\ref{{19.245}), % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.248} {{\cal A}[p,x] = \int_{{\lambda _a}^{{\lambda _b}d\lambda  \left[  -i{{ p}  x'         +         \frac{{\rho (\lambda )p^2}{{2M} +         \frac{{Mc^2}{{2}  \rho (\lambda )\right] . \end{{eqnarray} % After pseudotime slicing, it reads % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.249} {{\cal A}^N[p,x]  = \sum_{{n=1}^{{N+1}     \left[ -ip_n ( x _n- x _{{n-1})  + \rho _n \epsilon _n \frac{{p_n^2}{{2M}         + \frac{{Mc^2 }{{2}\epsilon _n\rho _n\right]. \end{{eqnarray} % At a  fixed $ \rho (\lambda )$, the path integral has then the usual canonical measure: % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.250} \int {{\cal D}^Dx \int \frac{{{{\cal D}^Dp}{{(2\pi \hbar)^D } e^{{-{{\cal A}[p,x]/\hbar} \approx \prod _{{n=1}^{{N} \left[ \int d^Dx_n\right]     \prod _{{n=1}^{{N+1} \left[ \int \frac{{d^Dp_n}{{(2\pi  \hbar )^D}     \right] e^{{-{{\cal A}^N[p,x]/\hbar}. \end{{eqnarray} % By integrating out the momenta, we obtain  (\ref{{19.251}) with the action (\ref{{19.252}). %  %************************* \noindent 4)~ The fixed-energy amplitude is related to (\ref{{19.1a}) by a Laplace transformation: % \begin{{eqnarray}    \left( {{\bf x}_b \vert {{\bf x}_a \right) _E \equiv -i     \int^{{\infty} _{{x^0_a} dx^0_b e^{{E(x^0  _b-x^0  _a)/\hbar } \left( {{ x}_b  \vert      {{ x}_a\right) , \label{{19.int}\end{{eqnarray} % where ${{ x^0}$ denotes the temporal component and ${{\bf x}$ the purely spatial part of the $D$-dimensional vector $x$. The poles and cut of $  \left( {{\bf x}_b \vert {{\bf x}_a \right) _E $ along the energy axis contain all information on the bound and continuous eigenstates of the system. The fixed-energy amplitude has  the path integral representation % \begin{{eqnarray}    \left( {{\bf x}_b \vert {{\bf x}_a \right) _E =  \int^{{\infty} _{{0}     dL \int {{\cal D} \rho \Phi [\rho ] \int \frac{{{{\cal D}^{{D-1} x}{{ \sqrt{{ \rho }^{{D-1}}  e^{{-{{\cal A}_E/\hbar }, \label{{19.int2}\end{{eqnarray} % with the action % \begin{{eqnarray}    {{\cal A} _E= \int^{{\lambda _b}_{{\lambda _a} d\lambda  \left[      \frac{{M}{{2\rho (\lambda )} {{\bf  x}'{{}^2 (\lambda )    - \rho (\lambda )    \frac{{E ^2}{{2Mc^2}   + \frac{{Mc^2}{{2} \rho (\lambda )\right]. \label{{19.2p}\end{{eqnarray} % This is seen by writing the temporal part of the sliced $D$-dimensional action (\ref{{19.252}) in the canonical form (\ref{{19.249}). By integrating out the temporal coordinates $x^0_n$ in (\ref{{19.250}), we obtain $N$ $ \delta $-functions. These remove $N$ integrals over the momentum variables $p^0_n$, leaving only a single integral over a common $p^0$. The Laplace transform (\ref{{19.int}), finally, eliminates also this integral, making $p^4$ equal to $-iE/c$. In the continuum limit, we thus obtain the action (\ref{{19.2p}).    %************************* \noindent 5)~ The path integral (\ref{{19.int2}) forms the basis for studying relativistic particles in an external time-independent potential $V({{\bf x})$. This is introduced into the path integral (\ref{{19.int2}) by simply substituting the energy $E$ by $E-V({{\bf x})$.  For an attractive  Coulomb potential in $D-1=3$ spatial dimensions, the above substitution changes the second term in the action (\ref{{19.2p}) to % \begin{{eqnarray}   {{\cal A}_{{\rm int} = - \int^{{\lambda _b}_{{\lambda _a} d\lambda   \, \rho (\lambda ) \frac{{( E + {{e^2}/{{|{{\bf x}|}) ^2 } {{2Mc^2} {{}. \label{{19.8}\end{{eqnarray} % The associated path integral is calculated with the help of a Duru-Kleinert transformation \cite{{DK} as follows:  First, we increase the three-dimensional configuration space in a trivial way by a dummy forth component $x^4$ (as in the nonrelativistic case). The additional variable $x^4$ is eliminated at the end by an integral $\int {{d x_a^4}/{{|{{\bf x}_a|}=\int d\gamma _a$ (see Eqs.~(13.114) and (13.121) in Ref. \cite{{PI}). Then we perform a Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation $ dx^\mu  = 2 A (u)^\mu {{}_\nu du^\nu  $ (Eq.~(13.100) in Ref. \cite{{PI}). This changes $x'{{}^\mu {{}^2$ into $4 \vec u^2 \vec u'{{\,}^2$, with the vector symbol indicating the four-vector nature of $\vec u$. The transformed action reads % % % \begin{{eqnarray} &&  \! \hspace{{-2cm}~ \,\tilde {{\cal A}_E\! =\!           \int^{{\lambda _b}_{{\lambda _a}\!d\lambda            \bigg\{{ \frac{{4M\vec{{u}^2}{{2\rho (\lambda )}               \vec{{u}'{{\,}^2(\lambda ) \!       + \!\frac{{\rho (\lambda )}{{2Mc^2 \vec{{u}^2}              \!  \left[ (M^2 c^4\! -E^2 )\vec{{u}^2      \!        - \!2Ee^2 \!-\! \frac{{e^4}{{\vec{{u}^2}\right] \!\!\bigg\}. \label{{19.10}\end{{eqnarray} % % We now choose the gauge $\rho (\lambda ) = 1$, and go from $\lambda $ to a new parameter $s$ via the time transformation $d\lambda  = fds$ with $f = \vec{{u}^2$. This leads to the Duru-Kleinert-transformed action % \begin{{eqnarray}   &&\hspace{{-2cm}{{\cal A}_E^{{\rm DK} =            \!      \int^{{s _b}_{{s_a} ds \bigg\{{ \frac{{4M}{{2}            \vec  u'{{\,}^2(s) + \frac{{1}{{2Mc^2}  \left[ \left( M^2 c^4 - E^2\right) \vec u^2             -2 Ee^2 - \frac{{e^4}{{\vec u^2}\right] \!\!\bigg\} . \label{{19.11}\end{{eqnarray} % It describes a particle of mass $\mu =4M$ moving as a  function of the ``pseudotime" $s$ in a harmonic oscillator potential of frequency % \begin{{eqnarray}   \omega = \frac{{1}{{2M  c} \sqrt{{  M^2 c^4 - E^2 }. \label{{19.12}\end{{eqnarray} % The oscillator possesses an additional attractive potential $ -{{e^4}/{{2Mc^2} {{\vec u^2} $ which is conveniently parametrized in the form of a centrifugal barrier  % \begin{{eqnarray}    V_{{\rm extra}  =   \hbar ^2 \frac{{l_{{\rm extra}^2}{{2\mu \vec u^2}, \label{{19.13a}\end{{eqnarray} % whose  squared  angular momentum has the negative value % \begin{{eqnarray}  l^2_{{\rm extra} \equiv - 4\alpha ^2, \label{{19.13}\end{{eqnarray} % where $\alpha $ denotes the feinstructure constant $\alpha \equiv e^2/\hbar c\approx 1/137$. In addition, there is also a trivial constant potential % \begin{{eqnarray}  V_{{\rm const} = - \frac{{E}{{Mc^2}e^2. \label{{19.14}\end{{eqnarray} % % If we ignore, for a moment, the centrifugal barrier $V_{{\rm extra}$, the solution of the path integral can immediately be written down (compare Eq.~(13.121) in Ref. \cite{{PI}) % \begin{{eqnarray}  \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \left( {{\bf x}_b \vert {{\bf x}_a\right) _E          = -i\frac{{\hbar}{{2Mc} \frac{{1}{{16}          \int^{{\infty} _{{0} dL         ~ e^{{e^2{{EL}/{{Mc^2\hbar } }          \int^{{4\pi }_{{0} {{d \gamma _a} \left( \vec{{u}_b L           \vert \vec{{u}_a 0 \right) , \label{{19.16}\end{{eqnarray} % where $ \left( \vec{{u}_b L \vert \vec{{u}_a 0\right)$ is the time evolution amplitude of the four-dimensional harmonic oscillator.  There are no time-slicing corrections for the same reason as in the three-dimensional case. This is ensured by the affine connection of the {{Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation} satisfying % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.pr} \Gamma _{{\mu }{{}^{{\mu \lambda  }=g^{{\mu \nu }e_i{{}^{{\lambda} \partial _\mu e^i{{}_\nu =0 \end{{equation} % (see the discussion in Section 13.6 of Ref. \cite{{PI}).   A $ \gamma _a $-integration leads to % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.13.n1} ({{\bf x} _b|{{\bf x}_a)_E & = & -i \frac{{\hbar }{{2Mc}\frac{{M\kappa }{{\pi \hbar}      \int _{{0}^{{1} d\varrho  \frac{{\varrho ^{{-\nu }}{{(1-\varrho )^2}      I_0 \left( 2\kappa  \frac{{2\sqrt{{ \varrho }}      {{1-\varrho } \sqrt{{( r_br_a +  {{\bf x}_b{{\bf x}_a)/2}\right)        \nonumber \\{{}    & &  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~  \times \exp \left[ -\kappa          \frac{{1+\varrho }{{1-\varrho } (r_b+r_a)\right], \end{{eqnarray} with the variable % \begin{{equation} \rho \equiv e^{{-2\omega L}, \label{{}\end{{equation} % and the parameters % % \begin{{eqnarray} \nu &=&\frac{{e^2}{{2\omega \hbar }\frac{{E}{{Mc^2}=\frac{{\alpha }{{\sqrt{{ M^2c^4/E^2-1}},\nonumber \\ \kappa& =&\frac{{\mu \omega }{{2\hbar }=\frac{{1}{{\hbar c}\sqrt{{ M^2c^4-E^2} =\frac{{E}{{\hbar c}\frac{{\alpha}{{\nu }. \end{{eqnarray} % % We now use the well-known expansion % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.13.n5} I_0 (z \cos (\theta /2)) = \frac{{2}{{z}    \sum _{{l=0}^{{\infty}          (2l+1) P_l (\cos\theta ) I_{{2l+1}(z) \end{{eqnarray} % and obtain the partial wave decomposition % % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.13.n8} ({{\bf x}_b|{{\bf x}_a)_E  & =  &  \frac{{1}{{r_br_a}\sum _{{l=0}^{{\infty}  (r_b|r_a)_{{E,l } \frac{{2l+1}          {{4\pi }          P_l (\cos \theta )\nonumber \\           & = & \frac{{1}{{r_br_a}      \sum _{{l=0}^{{\infty} (r_b|r_a)_{{E,l}      \sum _{{m=-l}^{{l} Y_{{lm} (\hat{{\bf x}_b) Y^*_{{lm}           (\hat{{\bf x}_a) , \end{{eqnarray} % with the usual notation for Legendre polynomials and spherical harmonics. The radial amplitude is, therefore, % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.13.n9} (r_b|r_a)_{{E,l} &=&- i\frac{{\hbar }{{2Mc} \sqrt{{ r_br_a}\frac{{2M}{{\hbar }     \int_{{0}^{{\infty} dy \frac{{1}{{\sinh y}e^{{2\nu y}      \\{{}    & &\times  \exp \left[ -\kappa  \coth y (r_b+r_a)\right]       I_{{2l+1}\left  (2\kappa \sqrt{{ r_br_a}\frac{{1}{{\sinh y}\right ).       \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} %  At this place,  the additional centrifugal barrier (\ref{{19.13a}) is incorporated via the replacement % \begin{{equation} 2l+1\rightarrow 2\tilde l+1\equiv \sqrt{{ (2l+1)^2+l_{{\rm extra}^2}. \label{{19.}\end{{equation} %  (as in Eqs.~(8.146) and (14.237) in Ref. \cite{{PI}). The integration over $y$ yields % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.13.n10}  (r_b|r_a)_{{E,l} =-i\frac{{\hbar }{{2Mc}\frac{{M}{{\hbar \kappa} \frac{{ \Gamma (-\nu +\tilde l+1)}    {{(2\tilde l+1)!}  W_{{\nu ,\tilde l+1/2} \left (2\kappa  r_b\right ) M_{{\nu ,\tilde l+1/2}        \left  (2\kappa r_a\right ) \end{{equation} %  (compare Eq.~(9.52) in Ref. \cite{{PI}).  This fixed-energy amplitude has poles in the Gamma function whenever $\nu -\tilde l-1=0,1,2,\dots ~$. They determine the bound-state energies of the Coulomb system. Subsequent formulas can be simplified by introducing the small positive $l$-dependent parameter % \begin{{equation} \delta _l\equiv l- \tilde l=l+1/2-\sqrt{{ (l+1/2)^2-\alpha ^2}\approx \frac{{\alpha ^2}{{2l+1}+{{\cal O}(\alpha ^4). \label{{19.}\end{{equation} % With it, the pole positions are given by $\nu  =\tilde n_l\equiv n-\delta _l$, with $ n=l+1, l+2, l+3, \dots~$, and the bound state energies become: % \begin{{eqnarray} E_{{nl}&=&\pm Mc^2\left [1+\frac{{\alpha ^2}{{(n-\delta _l)^2}\right]^{{-1/2} \nonumber \\ &\approx &\pm Mc^2\left[ 1-\frac{{\alpha ^2}{{2n^2} -\frac{{\alpha ^4}{{n^3}\left( \frac{{1}{{2l+1}-\frac{{3}{{8n}\right) +{{\cal O}(\alpha ^6)\right] . \label{{19.}\end{{eqnarray} % Note the appearance of the plus-minus sign as a characteristic property of energies in relativistic quantum mechanics. A correct interpretation of the negative energies as positive energies of antiparticles is straightforward within quantum field theory; it will not be discussed here.   To find the wave functions, we approximate near the poles $\nu \approx \tilde n _l$: % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.13.n13}    \Gamma (-\nu +\tilde l+1) &\approx & -\frac{{(-)^{{n_r}}{{n_r!} \frac{{1}{{\nu -\tilde n _l},\nonumber \\ \frac{{1}{{\nu -\tilde n_l} & \approx   & \frac{{2}{{\tilde n_l}\frac{{\hbar ^2\kappa ^2}{{2M} \left( \frac{{E}{{Mc^2}\right) ^2        \frac{{2Mc^2}{{E^2-E^2_{{nl}},\nonumber \\ \kappa  & \approx &\frac{{E}{{Mc^2}\frac{{1}{{a_H} \frac{{1}{{\tilde n_l}, \end{{eqnarray} % with the {{radial quantum number} $n_r=n-l-1$. In analogy with a corresponding nonrelativistic  equation (Eq.~(13.203) in Ref. \cite{{PI}), the last equation can be rewritten as % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.13.n11} \kappa  =\frac{{1}{{\tilde a_H}\frac{{1}{{\nu }, \end{{equation} where % \begin{{equation} \tilde a_H\equiv a_H\frac{{Mc^2}{{E} \label{{}\end{{equation} % denotes a modified energy-dependent Bohr radius. Instead of being $1/\alpha\approx 137 $ times the Compton wave length of the electron $\hbar /Mc$,  the modified Bohr radius which sets the length scale  of relativistic bound states involves the energy $E$ instead of the rest energy $Mc^2$.  With the above parameters, the positive-energy poles in the Gamma function can be written as  % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.13.n14} -i\Gamma (-\nu +\tilde l+1) \frac{{M}{{\hbar \kappa } \approx \frac{{(-)^{{n_r}}{{\tilde n _l^2 n_r!}         \frac{{1}{{\tilde a_H} \left( \frac{{E}{{Mc^2}\right) ^2 \frac{{2Mc^2i\hbar }{{E^2-E^2 _{{nl}}. \end{{equation} % Using this behavior and a property of the Whittaker functions (see Eq.~(9.73) in Ref. \cite{{PI}), we write the contribution of the bound states to the spectral representation of the fixed-energy amplitude as % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.13.n15} (r_b|r_a)_{{E,l} = \frac{{\hbar }{{Mc}\sum ^{{\infty} _{{n=l+1} \left( \frac{{E}{{Mc^2}\right) ^2  \frac{{2Mc^2 i\hbar }{{E^2-E^2_{{nl}}        R_{{nl}(r_b) R_{{nl} (r_a)+ \dots~ . \end{{equation} % A comparison between the pole terms in (\ref{{19.13.n10}) and (\ref{{19.13.n15}) renders the radial wave functions % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{19.13.n17} R_{{nl}(r)& =&\frac{{1}{{\tilde a_H^{{1/2}\tilde  n_l }\frac{{1}{{(2\tilde l+1)!}     \sqrt{{ \frac{{(\tilde n_l +\tilde l)!}{{( n -l-1)!}}\nonumber    \\{{}    & & \times (2r/\tilde n_l \tilde a_H)^{{\tilde l+1} e^{{-r/\tilde n_l \tilde a_H} M(-n +l+1,2\tilde l+2,2r/\tilde n_l \tilde a_H)   \\{{}    & =& \frac{{1}{{\tilde a_H^{{1/2}\tilde n_l}    \sqrt{{ \frac{{(n-l-1)!}{{(\tilde n+\tilde l)!}}           e^{{-r/\tilde n\tilde a_H} (2r/\tilde n_l\tilde a_H)^{{\tilde l+1} L_{{\tilde n_l-l-1}^{{2\tilde l+1}\nonumber             (2r/\tilde n_l\tilde a_H). \end{{eqnarray} % % The properly normalized total wave functions are % \begin{{equation} \label{{19.13.n16} \psi _{{nlm}({{\bf x}) =\frac{{1}{{r} R_{{nl} (r) Y_{{lm}(\hat {{\bf x}). \end{{equation} %   The continuous wave functions are obtained in the same way as in the non-relativistic case  (see Eqs.~(13.211)--(13.219) in Ref. \cite{{PI}).   This concludes the solution of the path integral of the relativistic Coulomb system. %******************************************************************  %****************************************************** %******************************************************************** % % \begin{{thebibliography}{{11} \bibitem{{DK}  H.

If true, this could herald very important new physics, particularly for the Higgs sector of the Standard Model ($N=D=4$) \cite{{HH}. Continuing work \cite{{HH2} in support of these ideas, has motivated us to point out that we previously studied the same properties and showed that they lead to very different conclusions \cite{{trunc}.  Indeed, in as much as the statements in ref.\cite{{HH} are correct, they point to some deep and beautiful facts about the LPA and its  generalisations \cite{{revi}, but however no new physics.   The LPA, which has a  long history \cite{{truncm}, approximates the renormalization group  by allowing interactions only in the form of a general  effective potential $V(\phi,t)$.  (Here $t=\ln(\Lambda_0/\Lambda)$, where $\Lambda_0/\Lambda$ is the overall/effective cutoff).  The sharp cutoff form \cite{{nico} can be written as: \begin{{equation} \hskip-.2cm  {{\dot V}+ d\phi V'-DV= (N-1)\ln(1+\frac{{V'}{{\phi}) +\ln(1+V''). \end{{equation}  Here we have written $d=D/2-1$,  ${{\dot V}\equiv\frac{{\partial V}{{\partial t}$   and ${{}^\prime\equiv\frac{{\partial}{{\partial \phi}$. Ref.\cite{{HH} computed the Taylor expansion coefficients $u_{{2n}$: $V=\sum_{{n=0}^\infty  \zeta^{{2-2n} u_{{2n} \phi^{{2n}$, where  $\zeta=(4\pi)^{{D/4}\sqrt{{\Gamma(D/2)}$. For the FPs {{\it i.e.} ${{\dot V}=0$, these coefficients can all be solved in terms of the mass coefficient $\sigma=u_2>-1$. The fact that $\sigma$ appears otherwise to be arbitrary, led the authors to conclude that  a continuum of FPs exist. If this were correct it would be difficult to understand why universality is seen experimentally (including in simulations) in the continuous phase transitions of many different systems,  where it is certainly not the case that the  (bare) effective potential is always polynomial.   Indeed if such a continuum really did exist for (1) (with $D>2$ \cite{{revi}) we would have to conclude that the LPA was too severe an approximation. Fortunately some magic occurs \cite{{trunc,revi}: all but a few FP solutions to (1) are unacceptable since they have singular  derivatives at some critical value of the field $\phi=\phi_c$, and fail to exist  for $\phi>\phi_c$. We plot $\phi_c$ in fig.1, for $N=D=4$. We see that only the Gaussian FP potential $V\equiv0$ exists for all $\phi\ge0$, supporting the standard lore on triviality. Furthermore,  for values of $\sigma$ around the minimum in fig.1, $\phi_c$ is the singularity closest to the origin in the $\phi$ complex plane, implying that $u_{{2n}\sim \phi_c(\sigma)^{{-2n}$ for large enough $n$. Thus, these $u_{{2n}(\sigma)$  have a local maximum at $\sigma=-0.64$.  Halpern {{\it et al} found this maximum and attributed it to a  maximum density of  FPs, however we see that it actually corresponds to the most singular possible putative FP potential.  \centerline{{ \epsfxsize=.7\hsize\epsfbox{{44.eps}}   \bigskip \centerline{{\vbox{{\noindent {{\bf Fig.1.} Numerical results for $\phi_c(\sigma)$.}}  Around any FP, for finite $\phi$,  the form of the allowed interactions may be studied by linearization: $\delta V(\phi,t)=\epsilon v(\phi) e^{{\lambda t}$. From this we tentatively deduce the existence of a small (renormalized) coupling  $g(t)=\epsilon e^{{\lambda t}$ of (scaling) dimension $\lambda$. However once again, experimentally we know that $\lambda$ is quantized, and it is crucial that the LPA reproduce this. Studying the limit  $\phi\to\infty$, we find that the $v(\phi)$ divide into two classes: quantized-$\lambda$ perturbations (QPs) that  behave as $\sim\phi^{{(D-\lambda)/d}$, and non-quantized-$\lambda$ perturbations  (NQPs) that behave as  $\sim\phi^q\exp(c\phi^p)$ with $c$ and $p$ positive. It is $\lambda>0$ choices of the latter that ref.\cite{{HH} argues give asymptotically free interactions. We have argued \cite{{trunc} that the NQPs lead to singular potentials at some $t>0$ \cite{{foo}, but irrespective of this, we can see that  NQPs do not scale as required, since for {{\sl any finite} $\epsilon$ the right hand side of (1)  contributes negligably as $\phi\to\infty$ and mean field evolution takes over: $\delta V(\phi,t)\sim\epsilon e^{{Dt} v(\phi e^{{-dt})$. While this $t$ evolution can still be absorbed into $g(t)$  in the case of the QPs, it cannot for the NQPs. Indeed at the Gaussian FP, where the QPs correspond to Laguerre polynomials,  it follows that as soon as $t>0$ the NQPs become integrable %evolves so that as soon as $t>0$, it is integrable with the Laguerre weight and may be reexpanded in terms of the QPs. Thus, clearly the QPs already span all the continuum physics.   Further pertinent observations may be found in  refs.\cite{{trunc,revi,truncm}. Our  conclusions hold for all forms of the LPA.  \medskip\noindent {{\bf Tim R.

If torsion were to be admitted  to the geometry, this derivation would become even more involved.  In this note, we want to point out that there exists a much shorter and more elegant derivation based on the use of nonholonomic coordinate transformations. By analogy with the physics of defects, these have recently been found to be an essential tool in {{\em predicting\/} the correct path integral in such spaces \cite{{1,5p,2}. The use of such transformations is very fundamental, and the transformation rules constitute a new {{\em quantum equivalence principle\/} \cite{{1,5p} which extends Einstein's famous classical principle to spaces with curvature and torsion, specifying the dynamical laws of both classical \cite{{8} and quantum physics \cite{{2}.  Here we do not intend to convince the reader of the virtues of this principle but want to direct his attention upon a useful technical advantage of using such transformations: a drastic simplification of the above-mentioned derivation of the Schr\"odinger equation.  \section{{Schr\"odinger Equations from Path Integral} Let us first recall the simple derivation of the Schr\"odinger equations from path integral of a free nonrelativistic particle of mass $M$ in euclidean space. The set of fluctuating paths in $D$ dimensions is parametrized by the time-dependent cartesian coordinates $x^i(t)$ $(i=1,\dots,D)$. The time axis is sliced into $N+1$ intervals $(t_n,t_{{n-1})$ $(n=1,\dots,N+1)$ of width $ \Delta t$ and the positions $x^i(t_n)$ are denoted by $x_n^i$. If $  \Delta x^i_n$ are the differences $  x^i_n-x^i_{{n-1}$, the time-sliced path integral has the measure % \begin{{equation}  \int d\mu _x^{{\rm new} : =  \lim_{{N\rightarrow  \infty}    \left[ \prod^{{N+1}_{{n=2} \int \frac{{d^D ( \Delta x_n)}       {{(2 \pi i \hbar  \Delta t/M)^{{D/2} }\right]  \exp    \left[ \frac{{i}{{\hbar}  \sum_{{n=1}^{{N+1}M \frac{{( \Delta x^i_n)^2}    {{2 \Delta t} \right], \label{{2}\end{{equation} % Separating the last integral over  $\Delta x_{{N+1}$ from the others, the amplitude $\psi_t(x)$ at the time $t$ is seen to satisfy the recursion relation % \begin{{eqnarray}   \psi_t (x) & = & \int \frac{{d^D  (\Delta x)   }    {{(2 \pi i\hbar  \Delta t/M)^{{D/2} }\exp \left[-\frac{{M}    {{2i\hbar  \Delta t }( \Delta x^i)^2 \right]  \psi_{{t- \Delta t}(x- \Delta x) . \label{{000}\end{{eqnarray} Expanding $ \psi_{{t- \Delta t}(x- \Delta x)$ in powers of $ \Delta x$ and using the Gaussian integral formula \begin{{eqnarray}  &&\int \frac{{d^D  \Delta   }{{(2 \pi \varepsilon/a)^D}  \exp      \left[ -\frac{{a}{{2\varepsilon}  \left( \Delta ^ i  \Delta ^ i \right)\right]       \left(1 + b_i  \Delta ^ i  + b_{{ ij }       \Delta ^ i   \Delta ^ j  + \dots \right) =    1 + \frac{{\varepsilon}{{a} b_{{ ii }         + {{\cal O} (\varepsilon^2 ), \label{{60}\end{{eqnarray} % one finds \begin{{eqnarray}   \psi_t (x) & = & \int \frac{{d^D (\Delta x) }    {{(2 \pi i\hbar  \Delta t/M)^{{D/2} } \exp \left[i\frac{{M}    {{2\hbar  \Delta t }( \Delta x^i)^2 \right] \nonumber \\ &&~~~~~\times\left[ \psi_{{t- \Delta t} (x) -     ( \Delta x)^i \nabla_i  \psi_{{t- \Delta t} (x)  + \frac{{1}{{2} ( \Delta x)^i   (\Delta x)^j \nabla_i\nabla_j \psi_t (x) + {{\cal O}(( \Delta t)^{{3/2})\right] \nonumber \\   & = &  \psi_t (x) +  \Delta t \left[ -\partial _t       \psi_t (x) + \frac{{i\hbar }{{2M}  {{\mbox{{\boldmath $\nabla$}}^2 \psi_t (x) \right] + {{\cal O} ( (\Delta t)^{{2}). \label{{0001}\end{{eqnarray} % In the limit $ \Delta t \rightarrow 0$, this yields the Schr\"odinger equation % \begin{{equation}  i\hbar \partial _t \psi = -\frac{{\hbar ^2}{{2M}  \Delta \psi. \label{{50}\end{{equation} % where $  \Delta \equiv {{\mbox{{\boldmath $\nabla$}}^2$ is the Laplace operator.   In noneuclidean spaces, the derivation becomes complicated. For the sake of generality, we shall admit some kind of curvature and torsion. Let $q^\mu(t)~(\mu=1,\dots D)$ be the paths in such a general space ${{\cal S}_q $. A nonholonomic transformation % \begin{{equation}   \dot x^i = e^i_\mu  (q) \dot q^\mu \label{{1}\end{{equation} % maps them into a reference space ${{\cal S} _x $ of ${{x}^i$-vectors $(i=1,\dots,D)$  with a euclidean metric. Under this transformation, the measure of path integration (\ref{{2}) goes over into \cite{{2} % % % \begin{{equation}  \int d\mu _q =  \lim_{{N\rightarrow  \infty}    \left[ \prod^{{N+1}_{{n=2} \int \frac{{d^D ( \Delta q_n)}       {{(2 \pi i \hbar  \Delta t/m)^{{D/2} }        \frac{{\partial ( \Delta x_n)}{{\partial ( \Delta q_n)}   \right]  \exp    \left( \frac{{i}{{\hbar}   \Delta {{\cal A}_q^{{N+1}\right), \label{{3}\end{{equation} % where $ \Delta {{\cal A}_q^{{N+1}$ is the time-sliced version of the classical action % % \begin{{equation}   {{\cal A}_q = \int^{{t_2}_{{t_1}   dt \frac{{m}{{2} g_{{\mu \nu} (q) 	\dot q^ \mu \dot q^ \nu\label{{4}\end{{equation} %  of the system, evaluated along the classical orbits. The tensor $g_{{\mu \nu } (q) = \sum_i e^i_ \mu (q)   e^i_  \nu (q)$ is  the  metric with a nonzero Riemann curvature tensor $\bar R_{{ \mu \nu \lambda }{{}^ \kappa $ derived from the covariant curl of the usual Christoffel symbols (Levi-Civita connection). The action  $\Delta {{\cal A}_q^{{N+1}$ can be expanded around prepoint, midpoint, or postpoint in each time slice, with the latter being the most convenient one for the derivation of the Schr\"odinger equation \cite{{1,2}. It will be  denoted by  $ \Delta {{\cal A}_>^{{N+1}$.   By a straight-forward but tedious generalization of the above euclidean derivation one finds  in the space ${{\cal S}_q$  the Schr\"odinger equation \cite{{4,5,6,7,1,2} % \begin{{equation}  i\hbar \partial _t \psi = -\frac{{\hbar ^2}{{2m}  \Delta \psi \label{{5}\end{{equation} % where $ \Delta\equiv  D^ \mu D_ \mu $ is the Laplace operator in a general metric-affine space. This operator is related to the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\bar \Delta \equiv \bar D^ \mu \bar D_ \mu\equiv  \sqrt{{g}^{{-1}\partial _\mu \sqrt{{g} g^{{\mu \nu} \partial _ \nu$ by $D^ \mu D_ \mu = \bar \Delta  - 2S^\mu\partial _\mu $. The symbol $D_ \mu $ denotes the covariant derivative with respect  to the affine connection $ \Gamma _{{ \mu  \nu  }{{}^ \gamma  = e_i{{}^ \gamma  \partial _ \mu  e^i_ \nu $ with nonzero torsion $S _{{ \mu  \nu  }{{}^ \gamma  =  \Gamma _{{[ \mu \nu ]}{{}^ \gamma $, and zero Cartan curvature $R_{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda }{{}^  \kappa = 0$, whereas $\bar D_ \alpha $ is the covariant derivative with respect to the Christoffel symbols $\bar  \Gamma _{{ \mu  \nu }{{}^ \kappa =  g^ {{ \kappa \lambda }\left(\partial _ \mu g_{{ \nu  \lambda }  + \partial _ \nu g_{{ \mu  \lambda } - \partial _ \lambda g_{{ \mu  \nu } \right)/2$ with nonzero Riemann curvature $\bar R_{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda }{{} ^  \kappa $, and zero torsion $\bar S _{{ \mu  \nu  }{{}^ \gamma  = \bar \Gamma _{{[ \mu \nu ]}{{}^ \gamma = 0$.  What makes the historic  derivation \cite{{4,5,6,7} of the Schr\"odinger equation~(\ref{{5}) tedious is the fact, observed first in Ref. \cite{{3}, that one has to calculate the time-sliced  action $ \Delta {{\cal A}_>^{{N+1}$ up to fourth-order terms in the differences $ \Delta q_n^ \mu  = q_n^ \mu  - q_{{n-1}^ \mu $, and the Jacobian $\lfrac{{\partial ( \Delta x_n)}  {{\partial ( \Delta q_n)}$ up to the second-order. Since $ \Delta q_n^\mu$ are of the order $ \sqrt{{ \Delta t}$, all these terms contribute to first order in $ \Delta t$, and thus to the Schr\"odinger equation. Instead of (\ref{{60}), the derivation requires the more general formula % \begin{{eqnarray}  &&\int \frac{{d^D  \Delta   }{{(2 \pi \varepsilon/a)^D}\sqrt{{g}       \left(1 + b_ \mu  \Delta ^ \mu  + b_{{ \mu  \nu }       \Delta ^ \mu   \Delta ^ \nu  + \dots \right)\nonumber \\ &&~~~~~~~~~\times \exp      \left[ -\frac{{a}{{2\varepsilon}  \left(g_{{ \mu  \nu }       \Delta ^ \mu  \Delta ^ \nu +G_{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda }    \Delta ^ \mu   \Delta ^ \nu  \Delta ^  \lambda + G_{{ \mu  \nu       \lambda  \kappa }  \Delta ^ \mu  \Delta ^ \nu  \Delta ^ \lambda      \Delta ^ \kappa  + \dots \right)\right] \nonumber \\     & & ~~~~~~~~~ =    1 + \frac{{\varepsilon}{{a} \left[ b_{{ \mu  \nu } 	     g^{{ \mu  \nu }  -\frac{{1}{{2} \left(G_{{ \mu  \nu 		  \lambda  \kappa } + G_{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda }        b_ \kappa \right) g^{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda  \kappa  }+        \frac{{1}{{8} G_{{\alpha  \beta  \gamma }G_{{\mu  \nu  \lambda }        g^{{ \alpha  \beta  \gamma  \mu  \nu  \lambda }\right]        + {{\cal O} (\varepsilon^2 ). \label{{6}\end{{eqnarray} %   Here  $b_ \mu , b_{{ \mu  \nu }$,  and $g_{{ \mu  \nu },    G_{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda }, G_{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda  \kappa },  \dots $ are $\varepsilon$-independent coefficients,   $g $ denotes the determinant of the metric $\det \| g_{{ \mu  \nu }\| $, and $g^{{\mu_1,\dots,\mu_{{2n}}$ are symmetric tensors formed from products of $n$ metric tensors:  $g^{{ \mu  \nu  \lambda  \kappa } = g^{{ \mu  \nu } g^{{ \lambda  \kappa } + g^{{ \mu  \lambda } g^{{ \nu  \kappa }  +  g^{{ \mu  \kappa } g^{{ \nu  \lambda },~~ g^{{ \alpha  \beta       \gamma \mu  \nu  \lambda } = g^{{ \alpha  \beta }    g^{{ \gamma \mu  \nu  \lambda } + g^{{ \alpha  \gamma }    g^{{ \beta \mu  \nu  \lambda }+ \dots ~$. % In the course of the calculations one encounters many  cancelations, which make the final result  (\ref{{5}) again very simple. There must be a derivation which  reflects the simplicity of the final result from the beginning, and this is what we want to present now.  % \section{{New Derivation} % First we observe that the time-sliced action $ \Delta {{\cal A}^{{N+1}_q $ which consists of the $\sum_{{n=2}^{{N+1}  \Delta  {{\cal A}_n $ calculated along the classical trajectories is a simple Gaussian when expressed in terms of the velocities $\dot q^\mu$ in each time slice. The classical trajectories are described by the equation of motion \begin{{equation}    \ddot q^ \mu  +  \Gamma _{{ \nu \lambda }{{}^ \mu  \dot q^ \nu\dot q^  \lambda = 0. \label{{7}\end{{equation} % This equations implies the conservation of the energy  $E =  g_{{ \mu  \nu } \dot q^ \mu     \dot q^ \nu /2 $.  As a consequence, the short-time action is % \begin{{equation}    \Delta {{\cal A} = \frac{{m}{{2} g_{{ \mu  \nu } \dot q^{{ \mu }   \dot q^ \nu   \Delta t = \frac{{m}{{2 \Delta t} g_{{ \mu  \nu }     \Delta\xi^ \mu  \Delta\xi^ \nu , \label{{8}\end{{equation} % where we have found it useful to introduce the {{\em vector\/} quantities $ \Delta\xi^ \mu$ defined by $ \Delta\xi^ \mu  \equiv \dot q ^ \mu  \Delta t$ whose size is of the order of $( \Delta t)^{{1/2}$, to have quantities comparable to the previous differences $ \Delta x^i$. In (\ref{{8}), the velocities $\dot q^\mu$ as well as the metric  $g_{{ \mu  \nu }$ are calculated at the latest time $t_n$ in the interval $(t_n,t_{{n-1})$, to have the preferred post-point form (any time would give the same result, due to energy conservation).  An explicit {{\em functional} relation between $\Delta \xi^\mu$ and $ \Delta q^\mu$ is obtained by Taylor-expanding % \begin{{eqnarray} \Delta q^ \mu & =& q^ \mu (t_n)   -q^ \mu (t_{{n-1}) =  q ^\mu (t_n) - q^ \mu  (t_n- \Delta t) = \dot q ^ \mu  \Delta t - \frac{{( \Delta t)^2}{{2!}\ddot q^ \mu +  \frac{{( \Delta t)^3}{{3!}\dot{{\ddot {{q}}^ \mu + {{\cal O} ( (\Delta t)^4) \nonumber \\ && \label{{}\end{{eqnarray} %  and using (\ref{{7}), which implies for the higher time derivatives $$\ddot q  ^\mu= -  \Gamma _{{\nu \lambda } {{}^ \mu\dot q^ \nu \dot q ^  \lambda ,~~~~  \dot{{\ddot q}^ \mu = -\left(\partial _  \kappa  \Gamma _{{ \nu  \lambda}{{}^ \mu  -2  \Gamma _{{\{{  \kappa  \delta\} }{{}^ \mu \Gamma _{{ \nu \lambda }{{}^  \delta \right)\dot {{q}^  \kappa  \dot {{q}^ \nu \dot {{q}^ \lambda,   $$ where curly braces around indices indicate their symmetrization. Hence, %%%% % \begin{{eqnarray}   \Delta q^ \mu & = &\Delta \xi^ \mu  + \frac{{1}{{2!} \Gamma _{{\nu  \lambda }{{} ^ \mu  \Delta \xi^\nu  \Delta \xi^ \lambda  - \frac{{1}{{3!} \left(\partial _ \kappa    \Gamma _{{\nu  \lambda } {{}^ \mu  - 2  \Gamma _{{\{{  \kappa  \delta \}}{{}   ^\mu   \Gamma _{{\nu  \lambda }{{}^ \delta \right)\Delta \xi ^ \kappa      \Delta \xi^\nu  \Delta \xi^ \lambda  +  \dots ,    \label{{9.a} \end{{eqnarray} % and this may be inverted to \begin{{eqnarray}  \Delta \xi^ \mu & = &  \Delta q^ \mu  - \frac{{1}{{2!}  \Gamma _{{\nu  \lambda }{{}^ \mu    \Delta q^\nu   \Delta q^ \lambda  + \frac{{1}{{3!} \left(\partial _ \kappa      \Gamma _{{\nu  \lambda }{{}^ \mu  +  \Gamma _{{\{{  \kappa   \delta \}}    {{}^ \mu     \Gamma _{{\nu  \lambda }{{}^  \delta \right)     \Delta q^ \kappa   \Delta q^\nu   \Delta q^ \lambda  +  \dots \,\,\, . \label{{9.b}\end{{eqnarray} %  Using this equation, we change  the integration variables $ \Delta q_n^ \mu$ in formula  (\ref{{3})  into $\Delta \xi_n^\mu$, and find the following measure for the path integral % \begin{{equation}   \int d\mu _q = \lim_{{N \rightarrow   \infty} \left[  \prod_n \frac{{d^D\Delta \xi_n}{{ (2 \pi i \hbar  \Delta t_n/m)^{{D/2}} \sqrt{{g(q_n)}\right]  \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{\hbar  \Delta t}\sum_{{n=1}^{{N+1}    g_{{ \mu  \nu } (q_n) \Delta \xi_n ^ \mu  \Delta \xi_n^ \nu \right] . \label{{10}\end{{equation} %  This expression is related to the flat-space measure (\ref{{2})  by just a linear transformation. The reason for this is that in terms of the nonholonomic $x$-variables, the  equation of motion (\ref{{7}) is % trivial: $\ddot x^i = 0$. Hence $\dot {{x}^ i = {{\rm const}$, and % \begin{{equation}  \Delta x^i = \dot x^{{i}  \Delta t =  e^i_\mu  \dot q^\mu   \Delta t =  e^i_\mu  \Delta \xi^\mu      ,  \label{{}\end{{equation} % so that  $ \lfrac{{\partial ( \Delta x)}{{\partial (\Delta \xi)  }  = \det \| e^i_\mu \| =  \sqrt{{g} $.  Using the simple measure (\ref{{10}), we immediately find for an amplitude $\psi_t(q)$ the recursion relation  (again by removing the last slice from the product of integrals)  % \begin{{eqnarray}   \psi_t (q) & = & \int \frac{{d^D \Delta \xi }    {{(2 \pi i\hbar  \Delta t/M)^{{D/2} } \sqrt{{g} \exp \left(-\frac{{M}    {{2i\hbar  \Delta t }g_{{ \mu  \nu } \Delta \xi^ \mu    \Delta \xi^ \nu \right)  \psi_{{t- \Delta t}\left(q- \Delta q(\Delta \xi)\right) . \end{{eqnarray} Expanding the amplitude inside the integral in powers of $ \Delta q^\mu$, and expressing these in terms of  $\Delta\xi^\mu $ with the help of (\ref{{9.a}), we find % \begin{{eqnarray}   \psi_t (q) & = & \int \frac{{d^D \Delta \xi  }    {{(2 \pi i\hbar  \Delta t/M)^{{D/2} } \sqrt{{g}\exp \left(-\frac{{M}    {{2i\hbar  \Delta t }g_{{ \mu  \nu } \Delta \xi^ \mu    \Delta \xi^ \nu \right) \nonumber \\ &&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \times\left[ \psi_{{t- \Delta t} (q) -     \left(\Delta \xi^\mu  + \frac{{1}{{2}  \Gamma _{{\nu \lambda   }   {{}^\mu  \Delta \xi^\nu  \Delta \xi^\lambda  \right)\partial _\mu  \psi_{{t- \Delta t} (q)  + \frac{{1}{{2} \Delta \xi^\mu  \Delta \xi^ \nu \partial _{{\mu}\partial _  \nu   \psi_t (q) + {{\cal O}(( \Delta t)^{{3/2})\right] \nonumber \\   & = &  \psi_t (q) +  \Delta t \left\{{ -\partial _t       \psi_t (q) + \frac{{i\hbar }{{2m} \left[g^{{\mu  \nu }    \partial _{{\mu }\partial _{{ \nu } \psi_t (q) - \Gamma _ \kappa{{} ^{{ \kappa \mu }    \partial _\mu \psi_t (q)\right]\right\} + {{\cal O} ( (\Delta t)^{{2}). \label{{gaussi}\end{{eqnarray} % % After making use of the identity $g^{{\mu  \nu } \partial _{{\mu} \partial _{{  \nu }-  \Gamma _ {{\kappa }{{}^{{ \kappa \mu }\partial _\mu =  D^\mu  D_\mu    $, this is precisely the Schr\"odinger equation (\ref{{5}). % \section{{Comparison with the historic derivation of the Schr\"odinger equation  in spaces with curvature and torsion } %  To compare the present derivation with the historic derivation in Refs. \cite{{4,5,6,7,1,2}, we  must calculate $ \Delta  {{\cal A} $ as a function of $ \Delta q^ \mu  $ up to fourth order terms using formulas (\ref{{8}) and (\ref{{9.b}). This yields % % \begin{{eqnarray}   \Delta  {{\cal A} & = & \frac{{m}{{2 \Delta t}\left[ g_{{\mu  \nu }                    \Delta q^\mu   \Delta q^ \nu  - \bar 		  \Gamma _{{\mu  \nu  \lambda }  \Delta q^\mu         \Delta q^ \nu   \Delta  q^ \lambda  + \frac{{1}{{3}         \left(\partial _\mu  \bar  \Gamma _{{ \nu  \lambda  \kappa }-      \frac{{1}{{4} \bar \Gamma _{{\mu  \nu  \sigma } \bar     \Gamma _{{ \lambda  \kappa }  {{} ^ \sigma \right)  \Delta q ^\mu   \Delta q^ \nu   \Delta q^ \lambda     \Delta q^ \kappa \right. \nonumber \\    &&~~~~~~~~~\left. + \frac{{1}{{3} S^ {{\sigma }{{}_{{\mu  \nu }          S_ {{\sigma  \lambda  \kappa }       \Delta q^\mu   \Delta q^ \nu  \Delta q^ \lambda         \Delta q^ \kappa  + {{\cal O} (( \Delta q)^5)\right] . \label{{11}\end{{eqnarray} % The Jacobian $ \lfrac{{\partial ( \Delta x)}{{\partial  ( \Delta q)}$ is conveniently given in the exponential form  % \begin{{equation} \lfrac{{\partial ( \Delta x)}{{\partial  ( \Delta q)} =  \sqrt{{g}  \exp \left({{i}  \Delta {{\cal A}_J'/\hbar\right), \label{{expf}\end{{equation} % with an effective action % % % \begin{{equation}   \frac{{i}{{\hbar }  \Delta {{\cal A}_J' = -  \Gamma _{{\{{\mu  \nu  \}}{{}^\mu         \Delta q^ \nu  + \frac{{1}{{2} \left[ \partial _{{\{{\mu }     \Gamma _{{ \lambda  \nu \} }{{}^\mu + \frac{{1}{{3}     \left( \Gamma _{{\{{ \mu  \kappa \}} {{}^ \mu     \Gamma _{{\{{ \lambda  \nu \}} {{}^ \kappa -   \Gamma _{{\{{  \lambda  \kappa \} }{{}^\mu   \Gamma _{{\{{  \nu \mu \}}{{}^ \kappa    \right)\right]   \Delta q^ \lambda   \Delta q ^ \nu+{{\cal O}   (( \Delta q)^3). \label{{12}\end{{equation} % Inserting these expansions into the product of integrals (\ref{{3}) we obtain a large number of terms. Upon applying formula (\ref{{6}), most of these cancel each other, leading again to the  Schr\"odinger equation (\ref{{5}).  The additional labor is the same as if we were to prove the obvious identity % \begin{{equation} [\lfrac{{\partial ( \Delta x)}{{\partial ( \Delta q)}]    [\lfrac{{\partial ( \Delta q)}  {{\partial (\Delta \xi) } ] = \lfrac{{\partial  ( \Delta x)}{{\partial (\Delta \xi)} =  \sqrt{{g} \label{{iden}\end{{equation} by writing $ [\lfrac{{\partial ( \Delta x)}{{\partial ( \Delta q)}] $ as in (\ref{{expf}) expanded via (\ref{{12}), and writing  $ \lfrac{{\partial ( \Delta q)}{{\partial (\Delta \xi)} = \exp \left({{i} \Delta  {{\cal A}_J''/\hbar\right) $ with % % \begin{{equation}  \frac{{i}{{\hbar }  \Delta  {{\cal A}_J'' =  \Gamma _{{\{{ \mu  \nu \}}{{} ^\mu   \Delta \xi^ \nu  - \frac{{1}{{2} \left(\partial _{{\{{ \mu }     \Gamma _{{ \lambda  \nu \}}{{}^\mu - 2  \Gamma _{{\{{\{{ \mu  \kappa \}}{{}^ \mu      \Gamma _{{ \lambda  \nu \}}{{}^ \kappa  +  \Gamma _{{\{{ \mu  \lambda \}}{{}   ^  \kappa \Gamma _{{\{{  \kappa  \nu \}}{{}^\mu \right)    \Delta \xi^ \lambda \Delta \xi^ \nu  + {{\cal O} (\Delta \xi^3), \label{{13}\end{{equation} % which follows from (\ref{{9.a}). Inserting here (\ref{{9.b}) one may reexpress the right-hand side as a power series in $ \Delta q$, and form the sum $  \Delta {{\cal A}_J' + \Delta {{\cal A}_J''$. The many terms in this sum all cancel each other, as required by (\ref{{iden}).  All such complications are avoided by working with the variables $ \Delta\xi^\mu$ in which the exponential in (\ref{{gaussi}) is a pure Gaussian.   %%% \begin{{thebibliography}{{11} %%% \bibitem{{4} B.\ S.\ DeWitt, Rev.\ Mod.\ Phys.\ {{\bf 29}, 377 (1957) \bibitem{{5} K.\ S.\ Cheng, J.\ Math.\ Phys.\ {{\bf 13},     1723 (1972) \bibitem{{6} H.\ Dekker, Physica, {{\bf A103}, 586 (1980) \bibitem{{7} G.\ M.\ Gavazzi, Nuovo Cimento, {{\bf A101}, 241 (1989) \bibitem{{1} H.~Kleinert, Mod.\ Phys.\ Lett.\ {{\bf A4}, 2329 (1989) \bibitem{{5p} H.~Kleinert, Phys.\ Lett.\ B {{\bf 236},  315 (1990) \bibitem{{2} H.~Kleinert, {{\em Path Integrals in Quantum  Mechanics, Statistics, and Polymer Physics\/},   World Scientific Publ.\ Co.\ (1995) \bibitem{{8} P.\ Fiziev and H.\ Kleinert, {{\em Variational     Principle for Classical Particle Trajectories in Spaces    with Torsion\/}, hep-th/9503074, and {{\em Euler Equations for Rigid Body --- A Case for Autoparallel Trajectories in Spaces with Torsion\/}, hep-th/9503075. \\ H.

Surprisingly, his amplitude turned out to satisfy a Schr\"odinger equation different from what had previously been considered as correct \cite{{pod}: Apart from the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the kinetic term, he obtained an extra effective potential proportional to the scalar curvature $R$. At the time of his writing, DeWitt could not think of any argument to outrule the presence of such an extra term.  DeWitt's work has had many successors \cite{{oth}. These employed various time-slicings  of the action, most popular being postpoint, midpoint, and prepoint prescriptions \cite{{stochasticde},  and added to it different correction terms proportional to $\hbar ^2$ to arrive at a Schr\"odinger equation of their personal preference.  In my opinion, such additional $\hbar ^2$-terms must be rejected since they violate the basic principle of Feynman path integrals, according to which a quantum mechanical amplitude should be obtainable from a sum over all paths with an amplitude which is the exponential $e^{{i{{\cal A}_{{\rm cl}/\hbar }$, where ${{\cal A}_{{\rm cl}$ is the purely classical action \cite{{dir} along the path.  The apparent freedom in writing down various path integrals has its counterpart in the apparent freedom of setting up a time-evolution operator $\hat H$ from a classical action % \begin{{equation} {{\cal A}= \int dt L(q^\mu(t),\dot q^\mu(t))= \int dt \frac{{M}{{2} g_{{\mu \nu}(q)\dot q^\mu \dot q^ \nu \label{{}\end{{equation} % whose Hamiltonian contains products of momenta $p_\mu\equiv  \partial L(q^\mu(t),\dot q^\mu(t))/\partial  q^\mu$ and positions $q^\mu$: % \begin{{equation} H(p,q)=\frac{{1}{{2M}g^{{\mu \nu}(q)p_\mu p_ \nu. \label{{h1}\end{{equation} % The metric $g_{{\mu \nu}(q)$ describes the geometry of configuration space. If the momenta $p_\mu$ are postulated to satisfy canonical commutation rules with the positions $q_ \nu$, there are many different operator orderings corresponding to the same $H(p,q)$. This problem has become known as the {{\em operator-ordering problem\/}, and its existence has caused a wide-spread myth among theoreticians, that it is basically unsolvable. In fact, many people have expressed their belief to the author that different physical systems might have to be quantized with different operator orderings.  Since some years, the author has been fighting this myth. There are many  physical systems with a Hamiltonian of the form (\ref{{h1}) for which we know a time-evolution operator $\hat H$ whose correctness has never been questioned. The most elementary example is the symmetric spinning top. If the classical Hamiltonian is written as in Eq.~(\ref{{h1}), with $q^\mu$ being the three Euler angles, and if $p_\mu$ abd $q^\mu$ are quantized canonically, there is of course an ordering problem. This, however, is due to having chosen the {{\em wrong\/} classical variables for quantization. Since the system is invariant under rotations but {{\em not\/} under translations, only the operators associated with the angular momenta $L_i$ have good quantum numbers, {{\em not\/} the generators of translations $p_\mu$. One must therefore rewrite the classical Hamiltonian (\ref{{h1}) as \cite{{ll} % \begin{{equation} H=\frac{{1}{{2M}L_i^2, \label{{}\end{{equation} % and impose commutation rules upon the angular momenta $L_i$: % \begin{{equation} [\hat L_i, \hat L_j]=i \epsilon_{{ijk}\hat L_k. \label{{}\end{{equation} % There is no operator-ordering problem in this procedure!  The same uniqueness holds for any Hamiltonian which is a linear combination of Casimir operators  and generators  of a group of motion in a curved configuration space. These observations form the basis of the so-called {{\em geometric quantization\/} \cite{{geom}, in which there is no source for an extra $R$-term.    Thus we are faced with the problem of finding a construction procedure for path integrals in curved spaces which is naturally capable of reproducing these well-established results of group quantization. Since path integrals are formulated in phase space in terms of $p^\mu$ and $q^\mu$-variables which should not be used as a basis for quantization in the operator formulation, this seems to be a hard task. Nevertheless, a solution has been found in the form of a simple geometric mapping principle. The necessity for finding this solution came from the desire to solve the time-sliced path integral of the hydrogen atom, a task which was completed in a continumum formulation 17 years ago \cite{{dk}. This solution proceeds by a three-step transformation to the path integral of a harmonic oscillator \cite{{PI}. In the language of ordinary quantum mechanics, the three steps proceed as follows: \\ First, the Hamiltonian is extended by a dummy forth momentum $p_ 4$ and written as % \begin{{equation} H=\sum _{{\mu=1}^{{4}\frac{{p_\mu^2}{{2M}+\frac{{e^2}{{r}, \label{{cpro}\end{{equation} % Second, a nonholonomic Kustannheimo-Stiefel transformation to coordinates $u^\mu$ with $r=u^2=\sum _{{\mu=1}^{{4}{{(u^\mu)}^2$ is used to transform $H$ to % \begin{{equation} H=\sum _{{\mu=1}^{{4}\frac{{p^u_\mu{{}^{{\,2}}{{8Mu^2}+\frac{{e^2}{{u^2}. \label{{hct}\end{{equation} % This is of the form (\ref{{h1}) and describes a system in a space with curvature. Only recently it was discovered that as a consequence of the nonholonomic nature of the transformation, the $u^\mu$-space carries also torsion \cite{{PI,ct1,ct2}.  Classical orbits satisfy energy conservation % \begin{{equation} H-E=0. \label{{clh}\end{{equation} % In a third step, the classical equation (\ref{{clh}) is multiplied by $u^2$ and becomes \begin{{equation} \sum _{{\mu=1}^{{4}\frac{{p^u_\mu{{}^{{\,2}}{{8M}+{{e^2}-{{u^2}E=0. \label{{clh}\end{{equation} % This has a unique operator version describing a harmonic oscillator. %  The intermediate Hamiltonian (\ref{{hct}) is associated with a unique path integral in a space with curvature and torsion, and thus constitutes  an important testing ground for any theory. If DeWitt's construction rules for a path integral in curved space are generalized to such a space, one obtains a very complicated Hamilton operator which does not yield the correct hydrogen spectrum \cite{{rem}.  A resolution of this puzzle became possible by the recent discovery of a simple rule for correctly transforming Feynman's time-sliced path integral formula from its well-known cartesian form corresponding to (\ref{{cpro}) to the spaces with curvature and torsion where the dynamics is governed by (\ref{{hct}). The rule promises to play a similar fundamental role in quantum physics as Einstein's equivalence principle in classical physics, where it fixes the form of the equations of motion in curved spaces. It has therefore been named {{\em  quantum equivalence principle\/} (QEP) \cite{{PI}.  The crucial place where this principle makes a nontrivial statement is in the measure of the path integral. The nonholonomic nature of the differential coordinate transformation gives rise to an additional term with respect to the naive DeWitt measure, and this  cancels  precisely the bothersome additional term proportional to $R$ in the Schr\"odinger equation in  curved space found by DeWitt \cite{{dw}, as well as the many similar additional terms which would appear when generalizing DeWitt's procedure to spaces with torsion \cite{{PI}.  It should be mentioned that QEP has drastic consequences even at the classical level if the space geometry possesses torsion. As we shall see below, the familiar action principle is no longer valid and requires modification: In the presence of torsion, the classical trajectories are autoparallels, not geodesics \cite{{fk1,PI}. This surprizing result is most easily illustrated by deriving the Euler equations for the motion of a spinning top from an action principle formulated {{\em within\/} the body-fixed reference frame, where the geometry of the nonholonomic coordinates possesses torsion \cite{{fk2}.    The purpose of this paper is to present another important evidence for the correctness of the quantum equivalence principle which arises the context of an exact bosonization of a nonabelian fermion model in quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian of this model is simply proportional to square of the total spin of a set of fermions at a point. It is described by a set of fermionic harmonic oscillator fields living in a flat field space. When bosonizing this model, the fermion fields are replaced by fluctuating angular fields living in a space with constant curvature. The associated path integral can be solved \cite{{PI}. The identity between initial and bosonized theory give a compelling confirmation for the presence of the nontrivial Jacobian generated by the nonholonomic transformation of the path integral measure.  A  similar nonabelian model has, incidentally,  been bosonized some 20 years ago \cite{{cqf} by the author in a study of pairing forces in nuclear physics \cite{{pair}. These forces are described by a BCS-like Hamiltonian similar to the one giving rise to the solid-state phenomenon of superconductivity. The BCS theory itself was approximately bosonized near the critical point almost 40 years ago by Gorkov in his famous derivation of the Ginzburg-Landau \cite{{gor,gl}. This procedure has been translated into a path integral language almost 20 years ago, after developing formalism  \cite{{cqf} which has since become the prototype for many similar enterprises. There exists now a simple theory of {{\em collective quantum fields\/} for a wide variety of many-body systems, including quarks and gluons \cite{{hadr}.  The derivation of a Ginzburg-Landau-like theory for superfluid ${{}^3$He \cite{{legg,cqf}, and a plasmon description of electron gases \cite{{cqf} were other important applications \cite{{tom}.   In superfluid ${{}^3$He, the derivation had a novel feature: It was an approximate bosonization of a {{\em nonabelian\/} system. In order to understand some typical problems arising from the nonabelian structure, the author studied in \cite{{cqf} the simple soluble fermion model of nuclear pairing forces which he was able to bosonize exactly, arriving at a Lagrangian of a spinning top. However, this bosonization was performed purely formally, without a careful treatment of the nonholonomic field transformation whose special properties were unknown at that time. The correct result was obtained only by omitting a proper examination of possible time slicing corrections. These would have been found to add to the energy  an undesirable DeWitt type of term proportional to $R$.  The recent progress in dealing with nonholonomic field transformations of path integrals described in Ref.~\cite{{PI} enables us to do better. We shall demonstrate that only by performing the nonholonomic field transformation according to the new rules provided by the quantum equivalence principle does the bosonized theory coincide with the original fermion theory.  The paper will start in Section II with the bosonization of a rather trivial model, which serves to illustrate several essential features of all bosonization procedures. The nonabelian model is treated in Section III.   An important tool for performing abelian bosonizations is the so-called Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation formula \cite{{hs}. Our nonabelian procedure provides us with a nonabelian version of this.  This formula should be useful for the bosonization of other theories, and will be given in Section IV.   Our results may have consequences for path integral bosonizations of two-dimensional nonabelian fermion theories \cite{{witten}, whose abelian versions were first treated by Coleman, Mandelstam, and others \cite{{cm}.   Let us first, however, recall the foundations of the quantum equivalence principle. For the sake of generality, we shall allow the nonholonomic coordinate transformations to generate torsion, just as in the theory of defects, although this general formulation is not required for the bosonization to be performed in this paper.   \section [Classical Motion of a Mass Point in a Space with Torsion~] {{Classical Motion of a Mass Point in a Space with Torsion} % \index{{gravitational field, classical motion in} \index{{classical motion in gravitational field} We begin by recalling that Einstein formulated the rules for finding the classical laws of motion in a gravitational field on the basis of his famous  \ind{{equivalence principle}. He assumed the space to be free of torsion since otherwise his geometric priciple was not able to determine the classical equations of motion uniquely. Since our nonholonomic mapping principle is not beset by this problem, we do not need to rescrict the geometry in this way. The correctness of the resulting laws of motion is exemplified by several physical systems with well-known experimental properties. Basis for these ``experimental verifications" will be the fact that classical equations of motion are invariant under nonholonomic coordinate transformations. Since it is well known \cite{{plastic,kro} that such transformations introduce curvature  and torsion into a parameter space, such redescriptions of standard mechanical systems provide us with sample systems in general metric-affine spaces.   To be as specific and  as simple as possible, we first formulate the theory for a nonrelativistic massive point particle in a general metric-affine space. The entire discussion may easily be extended to relativistic particles in spacetime.  \subsection{{Equations of Motion}  Consider the action of the particle along the orbit ${{\bf x}(t)$ in a flat space parametrized with rectilinear, Cartesian coordinates: % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.1} {{\cal A} = \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \frac{{M}{{2}( {{\dot{{x}^i})^2, \;\;\;\; i=1,2,3. \end{{equation} % It may be transformed to curvilinear coordinates $q^\mu, ~\mu =1,2,3$, via some functions % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.2} x^i = x^i(q), \end{{equation} % leading to % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.3} {{\cal A} = \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \frac{{M}{{2} g_{{\mu\nu}(q) \dot{{q}^\mu \dot{{q}^\nu, \end{{equation} % where % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.4} g_{{\mu\nu}(q) = \partial_\mu x^i (q) \partial_\nu x^i (q) \end{{equation} % is the {{\iem{{induced metric}} for the curvilinear coordinates. Repeated indices are understood to be summed over, as usual.  The length of the orbit in the flat space is given by % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.5} l = \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \sqrt{{g_{{\mu\nu} (q) \dot{{q}^\mu \dot{{q}^\nu}. \end{{equation} % Both the action (\ref{{10.3}) and the length (\ref{{10.5}) are invariant under arbitrary \iem{{reparametrizations of space} $q^ \mu \rightarrow q'{{}^ \mu $.   Einstein's equivalence principle\index{{Einstein's equivalence principle}\index{{equivalence principle} amounts to the postulate that the transformed action (\ref{{10.3}) describes directly the motion of the particle in the presence of a gravitational field caused by other masses. The  forces caused by  the  field are all a result of  the geometric properties of the metric tensor.  The equations of motion are obtained by extremizing the action in Eq.~(\ref{{10.3}) with the result % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.6} \partial_t(g_{{\mu\nu} \dot{{q}^\nu)-\frac{{1}{{2}\partial _\mu g_{{\lambda  \nu }\dot q^\lambda \dot q^\nu  = g_{{\mu\nu} \ddot{{q}^\nu + \bar{{\Gamma}_{{\lambda\nu\mu} \dot{{q}^\lambda \dot{{q}^\nu = 0. \end{{equation} % Here\vspace{{-0mm} \begin{{equation} \label{{10.7} \bar{{\Gamma}_{{\lambda\nu\mu} \equiv \frac{{1}{{2} (\partial_\lambda g_{{\nu\mu} + \partial_\nu g_{{\lambda\mu} - \partial_\mu g_{{\lambda\nu}) \end{{equation} % is the {{\iem{{Riemann connection}} or {{\iem{{Christoffel symbol}} of the {{\em first kind\/}. Defining also the Christoffel symbol of the {{\em second kind\/} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.8} \bar{{\Gamma}_{{\lambda\nu}^{{\;\;\;\;\mu} \equiv g^{{\mu\sigma} \bar{{\Gamma}_{{\lambda\nu\sigma}  , \end{{equation} % we can write\vspace{{-0mm} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.9} \ddot{{q}^\mu + {{{{{{{{\bar{{\Gamma}}_{{\lambda\nu}}}}^{{\;\;\;\;\mu} \dot{{q}^\lambda \dot{{q}^\nu = 0. \end{{equation} % The solutions of these equations are the classical orbits. They coincide with the extrema of the length of a curve $l$ in (\ref{{10.5}). Thus, in a curved space, classical orbits are the shortest curves, called {{\iem{{geodesics}}.  The same equations can also be obtained directly by transforming the equation of motion from\vspace{{-0mm} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.10} \ddot{{x}^i = 0 \end{{equation} % to curvilinear coordinates $q^\mu$, which gives % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.11} \ddot{{x}^i = \frac{{\partial x^i}{{\partial q^\mu} \ddot{{q}^\mu + \frac{{\partial^2 x^i}{{\partial q^\lambda \partial q^\nu} \dot{{q}^\lambda\dot{{q}^\nu = 0. \end{{equation} % At this place it is useful to employ the  so-called {{\iem{{basis triads}}\vspace{{-0mm} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.12} {{e^i}_\mu (q) \equiv \frac{{\partial x^i}{{\partial q^\mu} \end{{equation} % and the {{\iem{{reciprocal basis triads}} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.13} {{e_i}^\mu (q) \equiv \frac{{\partial q^\mu}{{\partial x^i}, \end{{equation} % which satisfy the orthogonality and completeness relations % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.14} {{e_i}^\mu {{e^i}_\nu & = & {{\delta^\mu}_\nu,\\  {{e_i}^\mu {{e^j}_\mu & = & {{\delta_i}^{{j}. \end{{eqnarray} % The \ind{{induced metric} can then be written as % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.16} g_{{\mu\nu} (q) = {{e^i}_\mu (q) {{e^i}_\nu (q). \end{{equation} % Labeling Cartesian coordinates, upper and lower indices $i$ are the same. The indices  $\mu, \nu$ of the curvilinear coordinates, on the other hand, can be lowered only by contraction with the metric $g_{{\mu\nu}$ or raised with the inverse metric $g^{{\mu\nu}\equiv(g_{{\mu\nu})^{{-1}$. Using the basis triads, Eq.~(\ref{{10.11}) can be rewritten as % \begin{{equation}  \frac{{d}{{dt} ({{e^i}_\mu \dot{{q}^\mu) = {{e^i}_\mu \ddot{{q}^\mu + {{e^i}_{{\mu,\nu} \dot{{q}^\mu \dot{{q}^\nu = 0,\nonumber \end{{equation} % or as % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.18} \ddot{{q}^\mu + {{e_i}^\mu {{e^i}_{{\kappa,\lambda} \dot{{q}^\kappa \dot{{q}^\lambda=0. \end{{equation} % The subscript $ \lambda $ separated by a comma denotes the partial derivative $\partial_\lambda = \partial/\partial q^\lambda$ , i.e., $f_{{,\lambda} \equiv \partial_\lambda f$. % % The quantity in front of $\dot{{q}^\kappa \dot{{q}^\lambda$ is called the {{\iem{{affine connection}}: % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.19} {{\Gamma_{{\lambda\kappa}}^{{\mu} = {{e_i}^\mu  {{e^i}_{{\kappa ,\lambda}. \end{{equation} % Due to (\ref{{10.14}), it can also be written as % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.20} {{\Gamma_{{\lambda\kappa}}^\mu = - {{e^i}_\kappa {{{{{{e_i}^\mu}}_{{,\lambda}. \end{{equation} % Thus we arrive at the transformed flat-space equation of motion % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.21} \ddot{{q}^\mu + {{\Gamma_{{\kappa\lambda}}^\mu \dot{{q}^\kappa \dot{{q}^\lambda = 0. \end{{equation} % The solutions of this  equation are called the {{\iem{{straightest lines}} or {{\iem{{autoparallels}}.  If the coordinate transformation functions $x^i(q)$ are smooth and single-valued, they are integrable, i.e., their derivatives commute as required by Schwarz's \ind{{integrability condition} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.22} (\partial_\lambda \partial_\kappa - \partial_\kappa \partial_\lambda ) x^i(q) = 0. \end{{equation} % Then the triads satisfy the identity % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.23} {{e^i_{{\kappa,\lambda}} = {{e^i_{{\lambda , \kappa}}, \end{{equation} % implying that the connection  ${{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda$ is symmetric in the lower indices. In this case it coincides with the \ind{{Riemann connection}, the \ind{{Christoffel symbol} $\bar{{\Gamma}_{{\mu\nu}^{{\;\;\;\;\lambda}$. This follows immediately after inserting $g_{{\mu\nu}(q)={{e^i}_\mu(q) {{e^i}_\nu (q)$ into (\ref{{10.7}) and working out all derivatives using (\ref{{10.23}). Thus, for a space with  curvilinear coordinates $q^\mu$ which can be reached by an integrable coordinate transformation from a flat space, the autoparallels coincide with the geodesics.  \subsection[Nonholonomic Mapping to Spaces with Torsion] {{Nonholonomic Mapping to Spaces with Torsion} It is possible to map the $x$-space locally into a $q$-space via an infinitesimal transformation % \begin{{equation} dx^i=e^i{{}_ \mu (q)dq^ \mu , \label{{10.diffi}\end{{equation} % with coefficient functions $e^i{{}_ \mu (q)$ which are not integrable in the sense of  Eq.~(\ref{{10.22}), i.e., % \begin{{equation} \partial _ \mu e^i{{}_ \nu (q) -\partial _ \nu e^i{{}_ \mu (q)\neq0. \label{{5.swr}\end{{equation} % Such a mapping  will be called \iem{{nonholonomic}. It does not lead to a single-valued function $x^i(q)$. Nevertheless, we shall write (\ref{{5.swr})  in analogy to (\ref{{10.22}) as % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.22x} (\partial_\lambda \partial_\kappa - \partial_\kappa \partial_\lambda ) x^i(q) \neq 0, \end{{equation} % since this equation involves only the differential $dx^i$. Our departure from mathematical conventions will not cause any problems.  {{}From Eq.~(\ref{{5.swr}) we see that the image space of a nonholonomic mapping carries torsion. The connection $ {{\Gamma_{{\lambda\kappa}}^{{\mu} = {{e_i}^\mu  {{e^i}_{{\kappa ,\lambda}$ has a nonzero antisymmetric part, called the \iem{{torsion tensor}:\footnote{{Our notation for the geometric quantities in spaces with curvature and torsion is the same as in \aut{{J.A.~Schouten}, {{\em Ricci Calculus\/}, Springer, Berlin, 1954.} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.24} {{S_{{\lambda\kappa}}^\mu  = \frac{{1}{{2} ({{\Gamma_{{\lambda\kappa}}^\mu  -{{\Gamma_{{\kappa\lambda}}^\mu). \end{{equation} % In contrast to ${{\Gamma_{{\lambda\kappa}}^\mu$, the antisymmetric part ${{S_{{\lambda\kappa}}^\mu$ is a proper tensor under general coordinate transformations. The  contracted tensor % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.25} S_\mu \equiv {{S_{{\mu\lambda}}^\lambda \end{{equation} % transforms like a vector, whereas the contracted connection $\Gamma_\mu \equiv {{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\nu $ does not. Even though ${{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda $ is not a tensor, we shall freely lower and raise its indices using contractions with the metric or the inverse metric, respectively: ${{\Gamma^\mu}_{{\nu}{{}^\lambda \equiv g^{{\mu\kappa} {{\Gamma_{{\kappa\nu}}^\lambda $, ${{\Gamma_\mu}^{{\nu}{{}^\lambda \equiv g^{{\nu \kappa} {{\Gamma_{{\mu \kappa}}^\lambda $, $\Gamma_{{\mu\nu\lambda} \equiv g_{{\lambda \kappa} {{\Gamma_{{\mu \nu}}^\kappa $. The same thing will be done with $ \bar{{\Gamma}_{{\mu \nu }{{}^\lambda $.  In the presence of torsion, the connection is no longer equal to the Christoffel symbol. In fact, by rewriting $\Gamma _{{\mu \nu \lambda }=e_{{i\lambda }\partial _\mu e^i{{}_\nu $ trivially as % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.26} &&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\Gamma _{{\mu \nu \lambda }=\frac{{1}{{2}\left\{{ e_{{i\lambda }\partial  _\mu e^i{{}_\nu +\partial _\mu e_{{i\lambda } e^i{{}_\nu +e_{{i\mu      }\partial  _\nu  e^i{{}_\lambda +\partial _\nu e_{{i\mu } e^i{{}_\lambda -e_{{i\mu     }\partial  _\lambda  e^i{{}_\nu -\partial _\lambda  e_{{i\mu  } e^i{{}_\nu\right\} \nonumber \\ &&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!+\frac{{1}{{2}\left\{{ \left[  e_{{i\lambda }\partial  _\mu e^i{{}_\nu -e_{{i\lambda }\partial  _\nu e^i{{}_\mu\right] -\left[ e_{{i\mu }\partial  _\nu e^i{{}_\lambda  -e_{{i\mu }\partial  _\lambda e^i{{}_\nu\right] +\left[ e_{{i\nu  }\partial  _\lambda  e^i{{}_\mu -e_{{i\nu  }\partial  _\mu e^i{{}_\lambda  \right] \right\} \nonumber % \end{{eqnarray} % and using ${{e^i}_\mu(q) {{e^i}_\nu (q)=g_{{\mu\nu}(q)$, we find the decomposition % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.26b}  %% {{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda ={{ \bar\Gamma }_{{\mu\nu }^{{\;\;\;\;\lambda} + {{K_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda, \end{{equation} % where the combination of torsion tensors % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.27a} K_{{\mu\nu\lambda} \equiv S_{{\mu\nu\lambda} - S_{{\nu\lambda\mu} + S_{{\lambda\mu\nu} \end{{equation} % is called the {{\iem{{contortion tensor}}. It is antisymmetric in the last two indices so that % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.27} \Gamma _{{\mu \nu }{{}^{{\nu }=\bar \Gamma _{{\mu \nu }{{}^{{\nu }. \end{{equation} %   In the presence of torsion, the shortest and straightest lines are no longer equal. Since the two types of lines play geometrically an equally favored role, the question arises as to which of them describes the correct classical particle orbits. The answer will be given at the end of this section.  The main effect of matter in Einstein's theory of gravitation manifests itself in the violation of the  \ind{{integrability} condition for the derivative of the coordinate transformation $x^i(q)$, namely, % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.28} (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu - \partial_\nu \partial_\mu) \partial_\lambda x^i (q) \neq 0. \end{{equation} % A transformation for which $x^i (q)$ itself is integrable, while the first derivatives $\partial_\mu x^i (q)= {{e^i}_\mu $ are not, carries a flat-space region into a purely curved one. The quantity which records the nonintegrability is the {{\iem{{Cartan curvature tensor}} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.29} {{R_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^\kappa = {{e_i}^\kappa (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu - \partial_\nu \partial_\mu) {{e^i}_\lambda. \end{{equation} % Working out the derivatives using (\ref{{10.19}) we see that ${{R_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^\kappa$ can be written as a covariant curl of the connection, % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.30} {{R_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^\kappa = \partial_\mu {{\Gamma_{{\nu\lambda}}^\kappa - \partial_{{\nu}{{\Gamma_{{\mu\lambda}}^\kappa - [\Gamma_\mu , \Gamma_\nu{{]_\lambda}^\kappa. \end{{equation} % In the last term we have used a matrix notation for the connection. The tensor components   ${{\Gamma_{{\mu\lambda}}^\kappa$ are viewed as matrix elements $(\Gamma_\mu{{)_\lambda}^\kappa$, so that we can use the matrix commutator % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.31} [\Gamma_\mu , \Gamma_\nu{{]_\lambda}^\kappa \equiv (\Gamma_\mu \Gamma_\nu - \Gamma_\nu \Gamma_\mu{{)_\lambda}^\kappa = {{\Gamma_{{\mu\lambda}}^\sigma {{\Gamma_{{\nu\sigma}}^\kappa - {{\Gamma_{{\nu\lambda}}^\sigma {{\Gamma_{{\mu\sigma}}^\kappa. \end{{equation} %  Einstein's original theory of gravity assumes the absence of  torsion. The space properties are  completely specified by the {{\iem{{Riemann curvature tensor}} formed from the \ind{{Riemann connection} (the \ind{{Christoffel symbol}) % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.32} {{{{\bar{{R}}_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^{{\;\;\;\;\;\;\kappa} = \partial_\mu {{ \bar{{\Gamma }}_{{\nu\lambda}^ {{\;\;\;\;\kappa} - \partial_\nu {{\bar{{\Gamma}}_{{\mu\lambda}^{{\;\;\;\;\kappa} - [\bar{{\Gamma}_\mu , \bar{{\Gamma}_\nu {{]_\lambda}^\kappa. \end{{equation} % The relation between the two curvature tensors is % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.33} {{R_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^\kappa = {{ {{\bar{{R}}_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^{{\;\;\;\;\;\;\kappa} + \bar{{D}_\mu {{K_{{\nu\lambda}}^\kappa - \bar{{D}_\nu {{K_{{\mu\lambda}}^\kappa - {{[K_\mu , K_\nu ]_\lambda}^\kappa {{}. \end{{equation} % In the last term, the ${{K_{{\mu\lambda}}^\kappa$'s are viewed as matrices $(K_\mu {{)_\lambda}^\kappa$. The symbols $\bar{{D}_\mu$ denote the {{\iem{{covariant derivatives}} formed with the Christoffel symbol. Covariant derivatives act like ordinary derivatives if they are applied to a scalar field.  When applied to a vector field,  they act as follows: % \begin{{eqnarray} \bar{{D}_\mu  v_\nu &  \equiv  & \partial_\mu v_\nu - {{{{\bar{{\Gamma}}_{{\mu\nu}}^{{\;\;\;\;\lambda} v_\lambda, \nonumber\\ \bar{{D}_\mu v^\nu &  \equiv  & \partial_\mu v^\nu + {{\bar\Gamma_{{\mu\lambda}}^{{\;\;\;\;\nu} v^\lambda.   \label{{10.34} \end{{eqnarray} % The effect upon a tensor field is the generalization of this;  every index receives a corresponding additive $\bar{{\Gamma}$ contribution.  In the presence of torsion,  there exists another covariant derivative formed with the affine connection $ {{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda$ rather than the Christoffel symbol   which acts upon a vector field as % \begin{{eqnarray}D_\mu v_\nu &  \equiv & \partial_\mu v_\nu - {{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda v_\lambda , \nonumber\\ D_\mu  v^\nu &  \equiv  & \partial_\mu v^\nu + {{\Gamma_{{\mu\lambda}}^\nu v^\lambda.     \label{{10.35} \end{{eqnarray} % This will be of use later.  {{}From either of the two curvature tensors, ${{R_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^\kappa$ and ${{{{\bar{{R}}_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^{{\;\;\;\;\;\;\kappa}$, one can form the once-contracted tensors of rank 2, the {{\iem{{Ricci tensor}} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.36} R_{{\nu\lambda} = {{R_{{\mu\nu\lambda}}^\mu, \end{{equation} % and the {{\iem{{curvature scalar}} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.37} R = g^{{\nu\lambda} R_{{\nu\lambda}. \end{{equation} % The  celebrated \ind{{Einstein equation}  for the gravitational field postulates that the tensor % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.38} G_{{\mu\nu} \equiv  R_{{\mu\nu} - \frac{{1}{{2} g_{{\mu\nu} R, \end{{equation} % the so-called {{\iem{{Einstein tensor}}, is proportional to the \ind{{symmetric energy-momentum tensor} of all matter fields. This postulate was made only for spaces with no torsion, in which case $R_{{\mu\nu} = \bar{{R}_{{\mu\nu}$ and $ R_{{\mu \nu },\,G_{{\mu \nu }$  are both symmetric. As mentioned before, it is not yet clear how Einstein's field equations should be generalized in the presence of torsion since the experimental consequences are as yet too small to be observed. In this paper, we are not concerned with the generation of curvature and torsion but only with their consequences upon the motion of point particles.   Two nonholonomic sample mappings producing curvature and torsion are shown in Fig. 1. They are used in the theory of defects to produce a crystal with a single dislocation or disclination, respectively. Readers not familiar with this subject are advised to  consult the Refs.~\cite{{plastic,kro} and the previous literature on this subject quoted therein.  Consider first the upper example in which a dislocation is generated, characterized by  a missing or additional layer of atoms (see Fig.~10.1). In two dimensions, it may be described differentially by the transformation % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.39} dx^i = \left\{{ \begin{{array}{{ll} dq^1 & ~~~\mbox{{for $i = 1$,} \\ dq^2  +  \ener \partial_\mu \phi(q) dq^\mu & ~~~\mbox{{for $i = 2$,} \end{{array}\right. \end{{equation} % with the multi-valued function % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.40} \phi(q)\equiv \arctan (q^2/q^1). \end{{equation} % The triads reduce to dyads, with the components % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.41} {{e^1}_\mu & = & {{\delta^1}_\mu~~ ,   \nonumber\\ {{e^2}_\mu & = & {{\delta^2}_\mu + \epsilon \partial_\mu \phi(q)~~, \end{{eqnarray} % and the  \ind{{torsion tensor} has the components % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.42a} {{e^1}_\lambda {{S_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda = 0 ,\;\;\;\;\; {{e^2}_\lambda {{S_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda = \frac{{\epsilon}{{2} (\partial_\mu \partial_\nu - \partial_\nu \partial_\mu) \phi. \end{{equation} % If we differentiate (\ref{{10.40}) formally, we find $(\partial_\mu \partial_\nu - \partial_\nu \partial_\mu) \phi \equiv 0$. This, however, is incorrect at the origin. Using Stokes'~ theorem we see that % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.43} \int d^2 q (\partial_1 \partial_2- \partial_2 \partial_1) \phi = \oint dq^\mu \partial_\mu \phi = \oint d \phi = 2\pi \end{{equation} % for any closed circuit around the origin, implying that there is a $\delta$-function singularity at the origin with % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.44} {{e^2}_\lambda {{S_{{12}}^\lambda = \frac{{\epsilon}{{2} 2\pi \delta^{{(2)} (q). %,~~~~{{e^2}_\lambda {{S_{{11 }}^\lambda = {{e^2}_\lambda {{S_{{12 }}^\lambda = 0. \end{{equation} % By a linear superposition of such mappings we can generate an arbitrary torsion in the $q$-space. The mapping introduces no curvature. When encircling a dislocation along a closed path  $C$, its counter image $C'$ in the ideal crystal does not form a closed path. The \ind{{closure failure} is called the \iem{{Burgers vector} % \begin{{equation} b^ i  \equiv \oint_{{C'} dx^i =\oint_{{C} dq^ \mu e^i{{}_ \mu . \label{{10.burg1}\end{{equation} % It specifies the direction and thickness of the layer of additional atoms. With the help of Stokes' theorem, it is seen to measure the torsion contained in any surface  $S$ spanned by $C$: % \begin{{eqnarray} b^i& =& \oint_Sd^2s^{{ \mu   \nu  } \partial  _ \mu  e^i{{}_  \nu =\oint_Sd^2s^{{ \mu  \nu }S_{{ \mu  \nu }{{}^  \lambda , \label{{10.encl1}\end{{eqnarray} % where $ d^2s^{{ \mu  \nu }=- d^2s^{{ \nu  \mu } $ is the projection of an oriented infinitesimal area element onto the plane $ \mu  \nu $. The above example has the Burgers vector % \begin{{equation} b^ i =(0, \epsilon ). \label{{}\end{{equation} %   A corresponding \ind{{closure failure} appears when  mapping a closed contour $C$ in the ideal crystal into a crystal containing a dislocation. This defines a Burgers vector: % \begin{{equation} b^ \mu  \equiv \oint_{{C'} dq^ \mu =\oint_{{C} dx^ie_i{{}^ \mu . \label{{10.burg}\end{{equation} % By Stokes' theorem, this becomes a surface integral % \begin{{eqnarray} b^ \mu& =& \oint_{{S}d^2s^{{ij} \partial  _i e_j{{}^  \mu =\oint_Sd^2s^{{ij}e_i{{}^  \nu \partial _  \nu   e_j{{}^  \mu \nonumber \\ &=&-\oint_Sd^2s^{{ij}e_i{{}^   \nu   e_j{{}^  \lambda   S_{{ \nu  \lambda   }{{}^ \mu , \label{{10.encl}\end{{eqnarray} % the last step following from (\ref{{10.20}).   The second example is the nonholonomic mapping in the lower part of Fig. 1 generating a disclination which corresponds to  an entire section of angle $\alpha$ missing in an ideal atomic array. For an infinitesimal angel $ \alpha$, this may be described, in two dimensions, by the differential mapping % % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.45} x^{{i } = \delta ^i{{}_ \mu [q^ \mu +  \Omega  \epsilon ^{{ \mu}{{}_  \nu q ^\nu\phi(q)], \end{{equation} % with the multi-valued function (\ref{{10.40}). The symbol $ \epsilon _{{ \mu  \nu } $ denotes the antisymmetric Levi-Civit\`a tensor. The transformed metric % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.46} g_{{ \mu  \nu }=  \delta _{{ \mu  \nu }- \frac{{2 \Omega  }{{q^ \sigma  q_ \sigma  }  \epsilon _{{ \mu  \nu } \epsilon ^ {{ \mu}{{}_{{  \lambda } \epsilon ^{{ \nu}{{}_{{\kappa } q ^ \lambda q ^ \kappa . \end{{equation} % is single-valued and has commuting derivatives. The torsion tensor  vanishes since $(\partial _ 1\partial _ 2 -\partial _ 2 \partial _ 1)x^{{1,2}$ is proportional to $q ^{{2,1}  \delta ^{{(2)}(q)=0$. The local rotation field $ \omega (q)\equiv \sfrac{{1}{{2}( \partial _1x^2-\partial _2x^1)$, on the other hand, is equal to the multi-valued function $- \Omega \phi(q)$, thus having the  noncommuting derivatives: % \begin{{equation} (\partial _1\partial _2-\partial _2\partial _1) \omega (q)=- 2\pi \Omega  \delta ^{{(2)}(q). \label{{}\end{{equation} % % To lowest order in $ \Omega $, this determines the curvature tensor, which in two dimensions posses only one independent component, for instance $R_{{1212}$. Using the fact that $g_{{ \mu  \nu }$ has commuting derivatives, $R_{{1212} $ can be written as % % \begin{{equation} R_{{ 1212 }=(\partial _ 1 \partial _ 2 -\partial _ 2 \partial _ 1 )  \omega (q) . \label{{}\end{{equation} % %   \subsection{{New Equivalence Principle}  In classical mechanics, many dynamical problems are solved with the help of nonholonomic transformations. Equations of motion are differential equations which remain valid if transformed differentially to new coordinates, even if the transformation is not integrable in the Schwarz sense. Thus we \iem{{postulate} that the correct equation of motion of point particles in a space with curvature and torsion are the images of the equation of motion in a flat space. The equations (\ref{{10.21}) for the autoparallels yield therefore the correct trajectories of spinless point particles in a space with curvature and torsion.  This postulate is based on our knowledge of the motion of many physical systems. Important examples are the Coulomb system \cite{{PI}, and the spinning top described with nonholonomic coordinates within the body-fixed reference system \cite{{fk2}. Thus the postulate has a good chance of being true, and will henceforth be referred to as a \iem{{new equivalence principle}.   \subsection[Classical Action Principle for Spaces with Curvature and Torsion] {{Classical Action Principle for Spaces \\ with Curvature and Torsion}  Before setting up a path integral for the time evolution amplitude we must find an action principle for the classical motion of a spinless point particle in a space with curvature and torsion, i.e., the movement along autoparallel trajectories. This is a nontrivial task since autoparallels must emerge as the extremals of an action  (\ref{{10.3}) involving only the metric tensor $g_{{ \mu  \nu }$. The action is independent of the torsion and carries only information on the Riemann part of the space geometry. Torsion can therefore enter the equations of motion only via some novel feature of the variation procedure. Since we know how to perform variations of an action in the euclidean $x$-space, we deduce the correct procedure in the general \ind{{metric-affine space} by transferring  the   variations $\delta x^i(t)$ under the nonholonomic mapping % \begin{{equation} \dot q ^\mu=e_i{{}^ \mu(q) \dot x^i \label{{10.diffbez}\end{{equation} % into the $q^ \mu $-space. Their  images  are quite different from ordinary variations as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{{10.pnonh}(a). The variations  of the Cartesian coordinates $\delta x^i(t)$ are done at fixed end points  of the paths. Thus they form \iem{{closed paths} in  the $x$-space. Their images, however,  lie in a space with defects and thus  possess a \ind{{closure failure} indicating the amount of torsion introduced by the mapping. This property will be emphasized by writing the images  $\deltabar q^\mu (t)$ and calling them {{\iem{{nonholonomic variations}}.  Let  us calculate them explicitly. The paths in the two spaces    are related by the integral equation  % \begin{{equation}     q^\mu (t) = q^\mu (t_a) + \int^{{t}_{{t_a}      dt'  e_i{{}^\mu (q(t')) \dot{{x}^i(t') . \label{{10.pr2}\end{{equation} % %%% For two neighboring paths in $x$-space differing from each other by a variation $ \delta x^i(t)$, Eq.~(\ref{{10.pr2}) determines the nonholonomic variation $\deltabar q^\mu (t)$: \begin{{equation}  \deltabar    q^\mu (t) =  \int^{{t}_{{t_a}   dt'       \deltabar [  e_i{{}^\mu (q(t')) \dot{{x}^i(t')]. \label{{10.pr2p}\end{{equation} % A comparison with (\ref{{10.diffbez}) shows that the variations $ \deltabar q^ \mu  $ and the time derivative of $q^ \mu$ are independent of each other % \begin{{equation}  \deltabar \dot{{q}^\mu (t) = \frac{{d}{{dt} \deltabar q^\mu (t), \label{{10.pdelta}\end{{equation} % just as for ordinary variations $ \delta x^i$.  Let us introduce an \iem{{auxiliary holonomic variation}s in $q$-space: % \begin{{equation}   \delta q^\mu  \equiv e_i{{}^\mu (q) \delta x^i. \label{{10.delq}\end{{equation} % In contrast to $\deltabar q^\mu (t)$, these vanish at the endpoints, % \begin{{equation} \delta q(t_a)=  \delta q(t_b)=0, \label{{10.versch}\end{{equation} % i.e., they form closed paths with the unvaried orbits.  Using (\ref{{10.delq}) we derive from (\ref{{10.pr2p}) the relation % \begin{{eqnarray}  \frac{{d}{{dt}\deltabar    q^\mu (t) &=&       \deltabar  e_i{{}^\mu (q(t)) \dot{{x}^i(t)       +  e_i{{}^\mu (q(t))\deltabar \dot x^i(t)\nonumber \\      &=& \deltabar  e_i{{}^\mu (q(t)) \dot{{x}^i(t)       +  e_i{{}^\mu (q(t)) \frac{{d}{{dt}[e^i{{}_ \nu (t) \delta q^ \nu (t)]. \label{{}\end{{eqnarray} % After inserting % \begin{{equation} \deltabar  e_i{{}^\mu (q)= -\Gamma_{{ \lambda  \nu }{{}^ \mu \deltabar q^ \lambda e_i{{}^ \nu  , {{}~~~~~ \frac{{d}{{dt } e^i{{}_\nu (q)= \Gamma_{{ \lambda   \nu  }{{}^ \mu  \dot q^ \lambda e^i{{}_\mu, \label{{}\end{{equation} % this becomes \begin{{equation} \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\frac{{d}{{dt} \deltabar    q^\mu (t) =  -\Gamma_{{ \lambda  \nu }{{}^ \mu \deltabar q^ \lambda \dot q^ \nu       + \Gamma_{{ \lambda    \nu  }{{}^ \mu  \dot q^ \lambda  \delta q^ \nu + \frac{{d}{{dt} \delta  q ^\mu           . \label{{10.prneu}\end{{equation} % % It is useful to introduce the difference between the nonholonomic variation $ \deltabar q^\mu $ and the auxiliary holonomic variation $ \delta q^ \mu $: % \begin{{equation}    \deltabar b ^\mu\equiv \deltabar q^\mu -\delta q^\mu. \label{{10.deldel}\end{{equation} % Then we can rewrite (\ref{{10.prneu}) as a first-order differential equation for $\deltabar b^ \mu $: % \begin{{equation}    \frac{{d}{{dt} \deltabar b^ \mu  = -             \Gamma _{{\lambda \nu }{{}^\mu  \deltabar b ^\lambda \dot{{q}^\nu              + 2S _{{ \lambda \nu  }{{}^\mu            \dot{{q}^ \lambda      \delta q^ \nu  . \label{{10.p83}\end{{equation} % After introducing the matrices \begin{{eqnarray}  \label{{10.p15} G {{} ^\mu (t){{}_ \lambda   \equiv   \Gamma _{{ \lambda  \nu }{{}^\mu                (q(t))\dot{{q}^\nu (t) \end{{eqnarray} % and % \begin{{eqnarray}     \Sigma  ^\mu{{}_\nu (t) \equiv  2   S_{{\lambda \nu } {{}^\mu                  (q(t)) \dot{{q}^ \lambda  (t)                 , \label{{10.p2equ}\end{{eqnarray} equation (\ref{{10.p83}) can be written as a vector differential equation: % \begin{{equation}    \frac{{d}{{dt} \deltabar b  = - G\deltabar b             +  \Sigma (t)\,\delta q^ \nu  (t). \label{{10.p83p}\end{{equation} % % % This is solved by % \begin{{eqnarray}    \deltabar b (t) = \int^{{t}_{{t_a} dt'           U({{t,t'})~ \Sigma  (t')~\delta q  (t'), \label{{10.pdel}\end{{eqnarray} % with the matrix % \begin{{equation}   U({{t,t'}) = T \exp \left[ -\int^{{t}_{{t'} dt'' G(t'')\right]. \label{{10.pum}\end{{equation} % In the absence of torsion,  $\Sigma (t)  $ vanishes identically and $\deltabar b (t) \equiv 0$, and the variations  $\deltabar q^\mu (t)$ coincide with the holonomic  $\delta  q^\mu (t)$ [see Fig.~\ref{{10.pnonh}(b)]. In a space with torsion, the variations  $\deltabar q^\mu (t)$ and $\delta  q^\mu (t)$ are different from each other [see  Fig.~\ref{{10.pnonh}(c)].  Under an arbitrary nonholonomic variation   $\deltabar q^\mu (t)= \delta q  ^ \mu+ \deltabar b ^ \mu  $, the action changes by % \begin{{eqnarray}   \deltabar {{\cal A} = M\int^{{t_b}_{{t_a} dt \left( g_{{\mu \nu }                \dot{{q}^\nu \deltabar \dot{{q}^\mu + \frac{{1}{{2}               \partial _\mu g_{{\lambda \kappa }              \deltabar q^\mu     \dot{{q}^\lambda \dot{{q}^\kappa \right). \label{{10.pvar0}\end{{eqnarray} % After a partial integration of the $ \delta \dot q$-term we use (\ref{{10.versch}), (\ref{{10.pdelta}), and the identity $  \partial _\mu g_{{ \nu  \lambda  } \equiv \Gamma _{{\mu \nu  \lambda  }+ \Gamma _{{\mu  \lambda  \nu  }$, which follows directly form the definitions $g_{{ \mu  \nu  }\equiv e^i{{}_ \mu  e^i{{}_ \nu  $ und  $\Gamma _{{\mu \nu }{{}^\lambda  \equiv e_i{{}^\lambda  \partial _\mu e^i{{}_\nu $, and obtain % % \begin{{equation}  \deltabar {{\cal A} = M\!\!\int^{{t_b}_{{t_a} dt \bigg[ \!-g_{{\mu \nu } \left(                \ddot{{q}^\nu  + \bar \Gamma _{{ \lambda  \kappa }{{} ^\nu                 \dot{{q}^\lambda \dot{{q}^\kappa \right)\delta q^ \mu +\left(g_{{ \mu  \nu } \dot q^ \nu \frac{{d}{{dt} \deltabar b ^ \mu + \Gamma _{{ \mu  \lambda   \kappa  } \deltabar b^ \mu \dot{{q}^ \lambda \dot{{q} ^ \kappa \right)\bigg]\!. \label{{10.pvar}\end{{equation} % %   To derive the equation of motion we first vary the action in a space without torsion.

In the presence of torsion, $\deltabar b^ \mu \neq 0$, and the equation of motion receives a contribution from the second parentheses in (\ref{{10.pvar}). After inserting (\ref{{10.p83}), the nonlocal terms proportional to $\deltabar b^ \mu $ cancel and the total nonholonomic variation of the action becomes % % % \begin{{eqnarray}   \deltabar{{\cal A} & = & -M \int _{{t_a}^{{t_b}dt g_{{\mu \nu }\left[ \ddot{{q}^\nu +      \left( \bar{{\Gamma }_{{\lambda \kappa }{{}^\nu +2S^ \nu {{} _{{\lambda \kappa }  \right) \dot{{q}^\lambda \dot{{q}^\kappa \right] \delta q^ \mu  \nonumber \\    & = & -M \int _{{t_a}^{{t_b}dt g_{{\mu  \nu }\left( \ddot{{q}^\nu  +           \Gamma _{{\lambda \kappa }{{}^\nu \dot{{q}^\lambda            \dot{{q}^\kappa \right) \delta q^ \mu  . \label{{10.delat}\end{{eqnarray} % % The second line follows from the first after using the identity $\bar{{\Gamma }_{{\lambda \kappa }{{}^\nu  = \Gamma _{{\{{\lambda \kappa \}}{{}^\nu  + 2 S ^\nu {{}_{{\{{\lambda \kappa \}}$. The curly brackets indicate the symmetrization of the enclosed indices. Setting $\deltabar{{\cal A}=0$ gives the autoparallels (\ref{{10.21}) as the equations of motions, which is what we wanted to show. %%%% %%%% %\footnote{{There are several consistency requirements, the most stringent one %being that when solving the path integral of the %hydrogen atom via the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation, the %spectrum should be correct. This transformation is nonholonomic and %leads to a space with curvature and torsion.}   \section[Alternative Formulation of Action Principle with Torsion] {{Alternative Formulation of Action Principle \\with Torsion}  The above variational treatment of the action is still somewhat complicated and calls for an simpler procedure which we are now going to present.\footnote{{See \aut{{H. Kleinert} und \aut{{A. Pelster}, FU-Berlin preprint, May 1996.}  Let us vary the paths $q^\mu(t)$ in the usual holonomic way, i.e., with fixed endpoints, and consider the associated variations  $ \delta x ^i=e^i{{}_\mu (q) \delta q^\mu$ of the cartesian coordinates. Taking their time derivative $d_t\equiv d/dt$ we find % % \begin{{equation} {{d _t} \, \delta x^{{\,i} = e^{{\,i}_{{\,\,\,\lambda} ( q ) d_t \delta q^{{\,\lambda} \label{{COM1} + \partial_{{\mu} e^{{\,i}_{{\,\,\,\lambda} ( q ) \dot{{q}^{{\,\mu}  \delta q^{{\,\lambda} . \end{{equation} % % On the other hand, we may write the relation (\ref{{10.diffi}) in the form $d_tx^i=e^i{{}_ \mu (q)d_tq^ \mu$  and vary  this to yield % \begin{{equation} \delta d_t x^{{\,i} \, = \, e^{{\,i}_{{\,\,\,\lambda} ( q )  \delta\dot q^{{\,\lambda} \label{{COM2} +  \partial_{{\mu}  e^{{\,i}_{{\,\,\,\lambda} ( q ) \, \dot{{q}^{{\,\lambda} \, \delta q^{{\,\mu} \, . \end{{equation} % Using now the fact that time derivatives $ \delta$ and variations $d_t$ commute for cartesian paths, % \begin{{equation} \delta  {{d_t} x^{{\,i} -  {{d_t} \delta x^{{\,i}  =  0  , \end{{equation} % we deduce from (\ref{{COM1}) and (\ref{{COM2}) that this is no longer true in the presence of torsion, where % \begin{{equation} \label{{COMMUTE} \delta d_t q^{{\lambda} - d_t \delta q^{{\lambda}   =  2 \, S_{{\mu\nu}^{{\,\,\,\,\,\lambda} ( q ) \, \dot{{q}^{{\mu} \, \delta q^{{\,\nu} \, . \end{{equation} % In other words, the variations of the velocities $\dot q^\mu(t)$ no longer coincide with the time derivatives of the variations of $  q^\mu(t)$.  This failure to to commute is responsible for shifting the trajectory from geodesics to autoparallels. Indeed, let us vary an  action % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{ACTION} {{\cal A} = \int\limits_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt L \left( q^{{\,\lambda} ( t ), \dot{{q}^{{\,\lambda} ( t ) \right) \end{{eqnarray} % % by $ \delta q^ \lambda(t)$ and impose (\ref{{COMMUTE}), we find % \begin{{eqnarray} \delta {{\cal A} =  \int\limits_{{t_a}^{{t_b}dt  \left\{{ \frac{{\partial L}{{\partial q^{{\lambda}}  \delta  q^{{\lambda} + \frac{{\partial L}{{\partial \dot{{q}^{{\lambda}}  \frac{{d}{{d t}  \delta q^{{\lambda} \right.  \left. +  2 \,S_{{\mu\nu}^{{\,\,\,\,\,\lambda}  \frac{{\partial L}{{\partial \dot{{q}^{{\lambda} } \, \dot{{q}^{{\mu}  \delta q^{{\nu} \right\}  . \label{{VARIATION} \end{{eqnarray} % After a partial integration of the second term using the vanishing $ \delta q^ \lambda(t)$ at the endpoints, we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equation % \begin{{eqnarray} &&\frac{{\partial L}{{\partial q^{{\,\lambda} } - \frac{{d}{{d t} \frac{{\partial L}{{\partial \dot{{q}^{{\lambda} } = 2  S_{{\lambda\mu}^{{\,\,\,\,\,\nu} \dot{{q}^{{\mu} \frac{{\partial L}{{\partial \dot{{q}^{{\nu} }       . \label{{EL} \end{{eqnarray} % This differs from the standard Euler-Lagrange equation by an additional contribution due to the torsion tensor. For the action (\ref{{10.3}) we thus obtain the equation of motion % \begin{{equation} M \, \Big[ g^{{\lambda \kappa}  \Big( \partial_{{\mu} g_{{\nu\kappa}  - \frac{{1}{{2} \, \partial_{{\kappa} g_{{\mu\nu}  \Big) +  2 S^{{\,\lambda}_{{\,\,\,\mu\nu} \Big]\dot{{q}^{{\,\mu}  \dot{{q}^{{\nu} = 0 , \end{{equation} % which is once more Eq.~(\ref{{10.21}) for autoparallels.   %************************************************************** %s10.3 \section %[Path Integral in Metric-Affine Space] {{Path Integral in Spaces with Curvature and Torsion} % \index{{space with curvature and torsion} We now turn to the quantum mechanics of a point particle in a general \ind{{metric-affine space}. Proceeding in analogy with the earlier treatment in spherical coordinates, we first consider the path integral in a flat space with Cartesian coordinates % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.49} ({{\bf x}\,t \vert {{\bf x}'t') = \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2\pi i \epsilon\hbar/M}^D}\prod_{{n=1}^{{N} \left[ \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} dx_n \right] \prod_{{n=1}^{{N+1} K_0^\epsilon (\Delta {{\bf x}_n), \end{{equation} % where $K_0^\epsilon (\Delta {{\bf x}_n)$ is an abbreviation for the short-time amplitude % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.50} K_0^\epsilon (\Delta {{\bf x}_n) \equiv \langle {{\bf x}_n \vert\exp \left( -\frac{{i}{{\hbar} \epsilon \hat{{H}\right) \vert {{\bf x}_{{n-1}\rangle = \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2\pi i \epsilon \hbar/M}^D} \exp\left[{{\frac{{i}{{\hbar}\frac{{M}{{2}\frac{{(\Delta{{\bf x}_n)^2}{{\epsilon}} \right] \end{{equation} % with $\Delta {{\bf x}_n \equiv {{\bf x}_n -{{\bf x}_{{n-1},\, {{\bf x} \equiv {{\bf x}_{{N+1},\, {{\bf x}' \equiv {{\bf x}_0$. A possible external potential has been  omitted since this would contribute  in an additive way, uninfluenced by the space geometry.  Our basic postulate is that the path integral in a general \ind{{metric-affine space} should be obtained by an appropriate nonholonomic\ins{{nonintegrable mapping}\ins{{nonholonomic mapping} transformation of the amplitude (\ref{{10.49}) to a \ind{{space with curvature and torsion}.  \subsection{{Nonholonomic Transformation of the Action} The short-time action contains the square distance $(\Delta {{\bf x}_n)^2$ which we have to transform to $q$-space. For an infinitesimal coordinate difference $\Delta {{\bf x}_n\approx d{{\bf x}_n$, the square distance is obviously given by $(d{{\bf x})^2 = g_{{\mu\nu} dq^\mu dq^\nu$. For a finite $\Delta {{\bf x}_n$, however, it is well known that we must expand $(\Delta {{\bf x}_n)^2$ up to the fourth order in $\Delta {{q_n}^\mu =  {{q_n}^\mu - {{q_{{n-1}}^\mu$ to find all terms contributing to the  relevant order $\epsilon$.  It is important to realize that with the mapping from $  d x^i$ to $ d q^ \mu $ not being holonomic, the finite quantity $ \Delta q^ \mu $ is not uniquely determined by $  \Delta x^i$. A unique relation can only be obtained by integrating the functional relation (\ref{{10.pr2}) along a specific path. The preferred path is the classical orbit, i.e., the autoparallel in the $q$-space. It is characterized by being the image of a straight line in the $x$-space. There $\dot x^i(t)=$const and the orbit has the linear time dependence % \begin{{equation} \Delta x^i(t)= \dot x^i(t_0)\Delta t,  \label{{10.linear}\end{{equation} % where the time $t_0$ can lie anywhere on the $t$-axis. Let us choose for $t_0$ the final time in each interval $(t_n,t_{{n-1}).$ At that time, $\dot x^i_n\equiv \dot x^i(t_n)$ is related to $\dot q^ \mu _n\equiv \dot q^ \mu (t_n)$ by % \begin{{equation} \dot x^i_n=e^i{{}_ \mu( q _n) \dot q^ \mu _n. \label{{10.arbit}\end{{equation} % It is easy to express $\dot q^ \mu _n$ in terms of $ \Delta q^ \mu _n=  q^ \mu _n- q^ \mu _{{n-1} $ along the classical orbit. First we expand $q^ \mu(t _{{n-1})$ into a Taylor series around $t_n$. Dropping the time arguments, for brevity, we have % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.66} \Delta q\equiv q^\lambda - q'^\lambda = \epsilon\dot{{q}^\lambda -\frac{{\epsilon^2}{{2!}\ddot{{q}^\lambda + \frac{{\epsilon^3}{{3!} {{{{\dot{{\ddot{{q}}}^\lambda}+\dots~, \end{{equation} % where $ \epsilon =t_n-t_{{n-1}$ and $\dot q^\lambda ,\ddot q^\lambda , \dots ~$ are the time derivatives at the final time $t_n$. An expansion of this type is referred to as a  \iem{{postpoint expansion}. Due to the arbitrariness of the choice of the time $t_0$ in Eq.~(\ref{{10.arbit}),  the expansion can be performed around any other point just as well, such as $t_{{n-1}$ and $\bar t_n =(t_n+t_{{n-1})/2$, giving rise to the so-called \iem{{prepoint} or \iem{{midpoint} expansions of $\Delta q$.  Now, the term $\ddot{{q}^\lambda$ in (\ref{{10.66}) is given by the equation of motion (\ref{{10.21}) for the autoparallel % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.67b} \ddot{{q}^\lambda = - {{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}{{}^\lambda \dot{{q}^\mu \dot{{q}^\nu. \end{{equation} %  A further time derivative determines % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.68}  \dot{{\ddot{{q}}^\lambda = - (\partial_\sigma {{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\mu\nu}}{{}^\lambda - 2 {{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\mu \nu}}{{}^\tau{{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\{{\sigma\tau\}}}{{}^\lambda  ) \dot{{q}^\mu  \dot{{q}^\nu \dot{{q}^\sigma. \end{{equation} % Inserting  these expressions into (\ref{{10.66}) and inverting the expansion,  we  obtain $\dot{{q}^\lambda$ at the final time $t_n$ expanded in powers of $\Delta q$. Using (\ref{{10.linear}) and (\ref{{10.arbit}) we arrive at the mapping of the finite coordinate differences: % \begin{{eqnarray} && \!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\! \Delta x^i= e^i{{}_\lambda \dot q^ \lambda  \Delta t \label{{10.69}  \\ &&\!\!\!\!= e^i{{}_\lambda \left[ \Delta q^\lambda \!-\! \frac{{1}{{2!} {{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\mu\nu}}{{}^\lambda \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu  \!+\! \frac{{1}{{3!} (\partial_\sigma {{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\mu\nu}}{{}^\lambda \!+\! {{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\mu\nu}}{{}^\tau{{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\{{\sigma\tau\}}}{{}^\lambda ) \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\sigma \!+\! \dots\right]\!,\nonumber \end{{eqnarray} % where $e^i{{}_ \lambda$  and $\Gamma _{{\mu \nu }{{}^\lambda $ are evaluated at the postpoint. Inserting this into the short-time amplitude (\ref{{10.50}),  we obtain \begin{{equation} \label{{10.55} K_0^\epsilon(\Delta {{\bf x})\! =\! \langle {{\bf x}\vert \exp\left( -\frac{{i}{{\hbar} \epsilon \hat{{H}\right) \! \vert {{\bf x}-\Delta {{\bf x}\rangle\! =\! \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2\pi i\epsilon\hbar/M}^D} \exp \left[\frac{{i}{{\hbar} {{\cal A}_>^\epsilon (q,q-\Delta q)\right] \end{{equation} % with the short-time \ind{{postpoint action} % \begin{{eqnarray} && \!\!\!\! \!\!\! \!\!\! {{\cal A}_>^\epsilon(q, q-\Delta q) = \frac{{M}{{2\epsilon}( \Delta x^i)^2= \epsilon\frac{{M}{{2} g_{{\mu\nu} \dot q^\mu \dot q^\nu \nonumber \\ &&\!\!\!\!= \bigg\{{ g_{{\mu\nu} \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu -  {{\Gamma}_{{\mu\nu\lambda} \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\lambda  \label{{10.56}   \\ & &~ +\left[ \frac{{1}{{3} g_{{\mu\tau} (\partial_\kappa     {{ \Gamma_{{\lambda\nu}}{{}^\tau+     {{ \Gamma_{{\lambda\nu}}{{}^\delta  {{ \Gamma_{{\{{ \kappa \delta\}}}{{}^\tau) + \frac{{1}{{4} {{ \Gamma_{{\lambda \kappa }}{{}^\sigma  \Gamma_{{\mu\nu\sigma}\right] \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\lambda \Delta q^\kappa+\dots~\bigg\}. \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} % Separating the affine connection into Christoffel symbol and torsion, this can also be written as \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.56b} && \!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!{{\cal A}_>^\epsilon(q, q-\Delta q)  = \frac{{M}{{2\epsilon} \bigg\{{ g_{{\mu\nu} \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu - \bar{{\Gamma}_{{\mu\nu\lambda} \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\lambda \nonumber  \\ & &+\left[ \frac{{1}{{3} g_{{\mu\tau} (\partial_\kappa     {{\bar\Gamma_{{\lambda\nu}}{{}^\tau+     {{\bar\Gamma_{{\lambda\nu}}{{}^\delta  {{\bar\Gamma_{{\delta \kappa }}{{}^\tau) + \frac{{1}{{4} {{\bar\Gamma_{{\lambda \kappa }}{{}^\sigma \bar\Gamma_{{\mu\nu\sigma}\right] \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\lambda \Delta q^\kappa \nonumber \\&&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+\frac{{1}{{3}S^ \sigma {{}_{{    \lambda \kappa }S_{{ \sigma  \mu  \nu } +\dots \bigg\}. \end{{eqnarray} %   Note that the right-hand side contains  only quantities \iem{{intrinsic} to the $q$-space. For the systems treated there (which all lived in a euclidean space parametrized with curvilinear coordinates), the present intrinsic result reduces to the previous one.  At this point we observe that the final short-time action (\ref{{10.56}) could also have been introduced  without any reference to the flat reference coordinates $x^i$. Indeed, the same action is obtained by evaluating the continuous action (\ref{{10.3}) for the small time interval $ \Delta t= \epsilon $ along the classical orbit between the points $q_{{n-1}$ and  $q_{{n}$. Due to the equations of motion (\ref{{10.21}), the Lagrangian % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.63} L(q,\dot{{q}) = \frac{{M}{{2}g_{{\mu\nu} (q(t)) \,\dot{{q}^\mu(t) \dot{{q}^\nu(t) \end{{equation} % is independent of time (this is true for  autoparallels as well as geodesics). The short-time action % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.64} {{\cal A}^\epsilon (q,q') = \frac{{M}{{2} \int_{{t-\epsilon }^{{t} dt \,g_{{\mu\nu} (q(t)) \dot{{q}^\mu(t) \dot{{q}^\nu(t) \end{{equation} % can therefore be written in either of the three forms % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.65} {{\cal A}^\epsilon = \frac{{M}{{2}\epsilon  g_{{\mu\nu} (q)\dot{{q}^\mu  \dot{{q}^\nu = \frac{{M}{{2}\epsilon  g_{{\mu\nu} (q')\dot{{q}'{{}^\mu  \dot{{q}'{{}^\nu = \frac{{M}{{2}\epsilon  g_{{\mu\nu} (\bar{{q}) {{\dot{{\bar{{q}}}^\mu {{\dot{{\bar{{q}}}^\nu , \end{{equation} % where ${{q}{{}^\mu,{{q}'{{}^\mu, {{{{\bar{{q}}}^\mu$ are the coordinates at the final time $t_{{n}$, the initial time $t_{{n-1}$, and the average time $(t_n+t_{{n-1})/2$, respectively. The first expression obviously coincides with (\ref{{10.65}).  The others can be used as a starting point for deriving equivalent prepoint or midpoint actions.\ins{{midpoint}\ins{{prepoint action} The prepoint action ${{\cal A}_<^\epsilon$ arises from the postpoint one ${{\cal A}_>^\epsilon$ by exchanging $ \Delta q$ by $- \Delta q$ and the postpoint coefficients by the prepoint ones. The midpoint action has the most simple-looking appearance: \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.59} \lefteqn{{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!~ \bar{{\cal A}^\epsilon (\bar{{q} + \frac{{\Delta q}{{2}, \bar{{q} - \frac{{\Delta q}{{2}) =}\\ \!\!\!\! \!\!\!\! &&\!\! \frac{{M}{{2 \epsilon } \left[ {{g}_{{\mu\nu}(\bar q) \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu \!+\!\frac{{1}{{12} g_{{\kappa\tau} (\partial_\lambda {{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\tau \!+ \!{{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\delta {{\Gamma_{{\{{\lambda\delta\}}}^\tau )  \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu\Delta q^\lambda \Delta q^\kappa+\dots \right],\nonumber \end{{eqnarray} % where the affine connection can be evaluated at any point in the interval $(t_{{n-1},t_{{n})$. The precise position is irrelevant to the amplitude producing only changes beyond the relevant order epsilon. %   We have found the postpoint action most useful since it gives ready access to the time evolution of amplitudes, as will be seen below. The prepoint action is completely equivalent to it and useful if one wants to describe the time evolution backwards. Some authors favor the midpoint action  because of its symmetry and intimate relation to an ordering prescription in operator quantum mechanics which was advocated by \aut{{H.~Weyl}. This prescription is, however,  only of historic interest since it does not lead to the correct physics. In the following, the action ${{\cal A}^\epsilon $ without subscript will  always denote the preferred postpoint expression (\ref{{10.56}): % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.62} {{\cal A}^\epsilon \equiv {{\cal A}_>^\epsilon(q, q-\Delta q) . \end{{equation} %  %10.3****************************************************************** \subsection{{The Measure of Path Integration}  \index{{measure, path}\index{{path measure} We now turn to the integration measure in the Cartesian path integral (\ref{{10.49}) $$ \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2\pi i\epsilon \hbar/M}^D} \prod_{{n=1}^{{N} d^Dx_n . $$ This has to be transformed to the general metric-affine space.\index{{metric-affine space, path measure} We imagine evaluating the path integral starting out from the latest time and performing successively the integrations over $x_N , x_{{N-1},\dots~$,  i.e., in each short-time amplitude we integrate over the earlier position coordinate,  the prepoint coordinate.  For the purpose of this discussion, we relabel the product $\prod_{{n=1}^{{N} d^Dx_n^i$ by $\prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1} dx_{{n-1}^i$, so that the integration in each time slice  $(t_n,t_{{n-1})$  with $n=N+1,N,\dots $ runs over $ dx_{{n-1}^i$.   In a flat space parametrized with curvilinear coordinates, the transformation of the integrals over $d^Dx_{{n-1}^i$ into those over $d^Dq_{{n-1}^\mu$ is obvious: % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.77} \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1} \int d^Dx_{{n-1}^i = \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1}\left \{{\int d^Dq_{{n-1}^\mu~\det\left[e_\mu^i (q_{{n-1})\right] \right\}. \end{{equation} % % The determinant of ${{e^i}_\mu$ is the square root of the determinant of the metric $g_{{\mu\nu}$: % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.78} \det({{e^i}_\mu) = \sqrt{{\det g_{{\mu\nu}(q)} \equiv \sqrt{{g(q)}, \end{{equation} % and the measure\index{{measure, path}\index{{path measure} may be rewritten as % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.79} \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1} \int d^Dx_{{n-1}^i = \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1}\left [\int d^Dq_{{n-1}^\mu~\sqrt{{ g(q_{{n-1})}  \right]. \end{{equation} % This expression is not directly applicable. When trying to do the $d^Dq^\mu_{{n-1}$-integrations successively, starting from the final integration over $dq_N^\mu $, the integration variable  $q_{{n-1} $ appears for each $n$ in the argument  of $\det\left[e_\mu^i (q_{{n-1})\right]$ or $ g_{{ \mu  \nu }(q_{{n-1})$. To make this $q_{{n-1}$-dependence explicit,  we expand in the measure (\ref{{10.77})  $e_\mu^i(q_{{n-1})=e^i{{}_\mu (q_n-\Delta q_n)$ around the postpoint $q_n $ into powers of $\Delta q_n$. This gives % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.80} dx^i = e_\mu^i (q-\Delta q) dq^\mu = e^i_\mu dq^\mu -{{e^i}_{{\mu,\nu} dq^\mu \Delta q^\nu + \frac{{1}{{2} {{e^i}_{{\mu,\nu\lambda} dq^\mu \Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\lambda + \dots~, \end{{equation} %  omitting, as before, the subscripts of $q_n$ and $\Delta q_n$.

But the equality holds also in the presence of torsion. Indeed, when inserting the decomposition (\ref{{10.26b}), ${{\Gamma_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda ={{ \bar\Gamma }_{{\mu\nu }^{{\;\;\;\;\lambda} + {{K_{{\mu\nu}}^\lambda,$ into  (\ref{{10.86}), the contortion tensor drops out since it is antisymmetric in the last two indices and these are contracted in both expressions.  In terms of ${{\cal A}_{{J_{{0n}}^\epsilon$, we can rewrite the transformed measure (\ref{{10.77}) in the more useful form % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.77da} \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1} \int d^Dx_{{n-1}^i = \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1}\left\{{ \int d^Dq_{{n-1}^\mu~\det\left[e_\mu^i(q_{{n})\right]  \exp\left( \frac{{i}{{\hbar}{{\cal A}_{{J_{{0n}}^\epsilon  \right) \right\}. \end{{equation} % %     In a flat space parametrized in terms of curvilinear coordinates, the two sides of (\ref{{10.77}) and (\ref{{10.77da})  are related by an ordinary coordinate transformation, and the right-hand side gives the correct measure for a time-sliced path integral. In a general \ind{{metric-affine space}, however, this is no longer true. Since the mapping $dx^i\rightarrow dq^\mu $ is nonholonomic, there are in principle infinitely many ways of transforming the path integral measure from Cartesian coordinates to a noneuclidean space. Among these, there exists a preferred mapping which leads to the correct quantum-mechanical amplitude in all known physical systems. It is this mapping which led to the correct solution of the path integral of the hydrogen atom \cite{{dk}.    The clue for finding the correct mapping is offered by an unesthetic feature of Eq.~(\ref{{10.80}): The expansion contains both differentials $dq^\mu$ and differences $\Delta q^\mu$. This is somehow inconsistent. When time-slicing the path integral, the differentials $dq^\mu$ in the action are increased to finite differences $\Delta q^\mu$. Consequently, the differentials in the measure should\index{{measure, path}\index{{path measure} also become differences. A relation such as (\ref{{10.80}) containing simultaneously differences and differentials should not occur.  It is easy to achieve this goal by changing the starting point of the nonholonomic mapping and rewriting the initial flat space path integral (\ref{{10.49}) as \begin{{equation} \label{{10.49b} ({{\bf x}\,t \vert {{\bf x}'t') = \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2\pi i \epsilon\hbar/M}^D}\prod_{{n=1}^{{N} \left[ \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} d ^D\Delta x_n \right] \prod_{{n=1}^{{N+1} K_0^\epsilon (\Delta {{\bf x}_n). \end{{equation} % Note that since $Q_n$ are Cartesian coordinates, the  measures\index{{measure, path}\index{{path measure} of integration in the time-sliced expressions  (\ref{{10.49}) and (\ref{{10.49b}) are certainly identical: \begin{{equation} \label{{10.87} \prod_{{n=1}^{{N}\int  d^D x_n \equiv  \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1} \int d^D \Delta x_n. \end{{equation} % Their images under a nonholonomic mapping, however, are different so that the initial form of the time-sliced path integral is a matter of choice. The initial form (\ref{{10.49b}) has the obvious advantage that the integration variables are precisely the quantities  $\Delta x^i_n$ which occur in the short-time amplitude $K_0^ \epsilon ( \Delta x_n)$. % % %  Under a nonholonomic transformation, the right-hand side of Eq.~(\ref{{10.87}) leads to the integral measure in a general \ind{{metric-affine space} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.77b} %\prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1} \int d^Dx_{{n-1} \rightarrow \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1} \int d^D\Delta x_{{n} \rightarrow \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1} \left[\int d^D\Delta q_{{n}\,J_n\right], \end{{equation} %  with the Jacobian following from (\ref{{10.69}) (omitting $n$) % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.89ex} J&\!\! =&\! \!\frac{{\partial(\Delta x)}{{\partial(\Delta q)} \\ &\!\!=&\!     \! \det(e^i{{}_\kappa)\,\det\!\!\left[  \delta  _\mu {{}^ \lambda \!-\!  {{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\{{\mu\nu\}}}{{\!}^\lambda  \Delta q^\nu  \!+\! \frac{{1}{{2} (\partial_\sigma {{{{{{\Gamma}}_{{\mu\nu}}{{\!}^\lambda \!+ \!\Gamma_{{\{{\mu\nu}{{}^\tau \Gamma_{{ \{{\tau|\sigma \}\} }{{\!}^\lambda)   \Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\sigma \!+\! \dots\right]\hspace{{-2pt}. \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} % In a space with curvature and torsion, the measure on the right-hand side of (\ref{{10.77b}) replaces the flat-space measure on the right-hand side of (\ref{{10.79}). The curly double brackets around the indices $ \nu,  \kappa , \sigma , \mu$ indicate a symmetrization in $\tau $ and $ \sigma $ followed by a symmetrization in $ \mu  ,\nu$, and  $\sigma $. With the help of formula (\ref{{10.83}) we now calculate the  Jacobian action\index{{Jacobian action}\index{{action, Jacobian} % %\begin{{equation} \label{{10.90} %\!\!\frac{{i}{{\hbar} {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J} = -{{e_i}^\kappa {{e^i}_{{\kappa,\nu} %\Delta q^\nu + \frac{{1}{{2} [{{e_i}^\mu e^i_{{\{{ \mu,\nu\lambda\} } %- {{e_i}^\mu e^i_{{\{{ \kappa,\nu \}} %{{e_j}^\kappa e^j_{{\{{\mu,\lambda\}}] %\Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\lambda+ \dots, %\end{{equation} % %with the determinant $\det (e^i_\mu)=\sqrt{{g(q)}$ evaluated at %the postpoint of the interval $\Delta q$. %Using (\ref{{10.19}), (\ref{{10.53}) and (\ref{{10.54}), this is expressed in %%terms of the %connection and yields % \begin{{eqnarray} \!\!\!\!\frac{{i}{{\hbar}{{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J} &=&-\Gamma_{{\{{\mu\nu\}}{{}^\mu \Delta q^\nu\label{{10.91}  \\  &&+  \frac{{1}{{2} \left[\partial_{{\{{\mu} \Gamma_{{\nu\kappa\} }{{}^\kappa + {{\Gamma_{{\{{ \nu\kappa}}^\sigma \Gamma_{{ \{{ \sigma|\mu \}\}}{{}^\kappa - {{\Gamma_{{\{{ \nu\kappa\} }}^\sigma {{\Gamma_{{\{{\sigma \mu\} }}^\kappa \right] \Delta q^\nu \Delta q^\mu + \dots~. \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} % This expression differs from the earlier Jacobian action (\ref{{10.86}) by the symmetrization symbols. Dropping them, the two expressions coincide. This is allowed if $q^ \mu $ are curvilinear coordinates in a flat space. Since then the transformation functions $x^i(q)$ and their first derivatives $\partial_\mu x^i(q)$ are integrable and possess commuting derivatives, the two Jacobian actions (\ref{{10.86}) and (\ref{{10.91}) are identical.  There is a further good reason for choosing (\ref{{10.87}) as a starting point for the nonholonomic transformation of the measure.\index{{measure, path}\index{{path measure} According to Huygens' principle of wave optics, each point of a wave front is a center of a new spherical wave propagating from that point. Therefore, in a  \ind{{time-sliced path integral}, the differences $\Delta x_n^i$ play a more fundamental role than the coordinates themselves.  Intimately related to this is the observation that in the canonical form, a short-time piece of the action reads % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.92} \int \frac{{dp_n}{{2\pi\hbar} \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{\hbar} p_n (x_n-x_{{n-1}) - \frac{{ip_n^2}{{2M\hbar}t\right].\nonumber \end{{equation} % Each momentum is associated with a coordinate difference $\Delta x_n \equiv x_n~-~x_{{n-1}$. Thus, we should expect the spatial integrations conjugate to $p_n$ to run over the coordinate differences $\Delta x_n = x_n -x_{{n-1}$~~rather than the coordinates $x_n$ themselves, which makes the important difference in the subsequent nonholonomic coordinate transformation.   We are thus led to postulate the following \index{{time-sliced path integral} time-sliced path integral in $q$-space: % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.93} \lefteqn{{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \langle q\vert \exp\left[ - \frac{{i}{{\hbar}(t-t')\hat{{H}\right]\vert q' \rangle = \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2\pi i\hbar\epsilon/M}^D}\prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1}\left[ \int{{d^D \Delta q_n}  \frac{{\sqrt{{g(q_n)}}{{\sqrt{{2\pi i\epsilon\hbar/M}^D}\right] }\nonumber \\ &&~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \times \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{\hbar} \sum_{{n=1}^{{N+1}({{\cal A}^\epsilon  +{{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J})\right], \end{{eqnarray} % where the integrals over $\Delta q_n$ may be performed successively from $n=N$ down to $n=1$.  Let us emphasize that this expression has not been {{\em derived} from the flat space path integral. It is the result of a specific new \iem{{quantum equivalence principle} which rules how a flat space path integral behaves under nonholonomic coordinate transformations.  It is useful to reexpress our result in a different form which clarifies best the relation with the naively expected measure of path integration \index{{measure, path}\index{{path measure} (\ref{{10.79}), the product of integrals % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.94} \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\prod_{{n=1}^{{N} \int d^Dx_{{n} = \prod_{{n=1}^{{N}\left[ \int d^Dq_{{n}\,\sqrt{{ g(q_{{n})}  \right]                               . \end{{equation} % The measure in (\ref{{10.93}) can be expressed in terms of (\ref{{10.94}) as % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{} \prod_{{n=2}^{{N+1}  \left[ \int{{d^D \Delta q_n} \sqrt{{  g(q_{{n})}\right]   =   \prod_{{n=1}^{{N}\left [\int d^Dq_{{n}\,\sqrt{{ g(q_{{n})} e^{{-i {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J_0}/\hbar }  \right].\nonumber \end{{eqnarray} % The corresponding expression for the entire time-sliced path integral\index{{measure, path}\index{{path measure} (\ref{{10.93}) in the \ind{{metric-affine space} reads % % % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.93b} \lefteqn{{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \langle q\vert \exp\left[ - \frac{{i}{{\hbar}(t-t')\hat{{H}\right]\vert q' \rangle = \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2\pi i\hbar\epsilon/M}^D}  \prod_{{n=1}^{{N}\left [\int d^Dq_{{n}\frac{{\sqrt{{ g(q_{{n})}} {{\sqrt{{2\pi i\hbar\epsilon/M}^D}   \right]    }\nonumber \\ &&~~~~~~~ \times \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{\hbar} \sum_{{n=1}^{{N+1}({{\cal A}^\epsilon +\Delta  {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J}) \right], \end{{eqnarray} % where $ \Delta {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J}$ is the difference between the correct and the wrong Jacobian actions in Eqs.~(\ref{{10.86}) and (\ref{{10.91}): % % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.96} \Delta    {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J}\equiv  {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J} - {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J_0}. \end{{eqnarray} % %  In the absence of torsion where $ \Gamma _{{\{{\mu \nu \}}{{}^\lambda ={{\bar\Gamma} _{{\mu \nu }{{}^\lambda $, this simplifies to % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10.97} \frac{{i}{{\hbar}\Delta {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J} =\frac{{1 }{{6} \bar R_{{\mu \nu }\Delta q^\mu\Delta q^\nu , \end{{eqnarray} % where $ \bar R_{{\mu \nu }$ is the Ricci tensor associated with the Riemann curvature tensor, i.e., the contraction (\ref{{10.36}) of the Riemann curvature tensor associated with the Christoffel symbol $\bar \Gamma _{{\mu \nu }{{}^\lambda $.  Being quadratic in $ \Delta q$, the effect of the additional action can easily be evaluated perturbatively using the methods explained in Chapter~8, according to which $ \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu $ may be replaced by its lowest order expectation % \begin{{eqnarray}  \langle \Delta q^\mu \Delta q^\nu \rangle _0 =i\epsilon \hbar g^{{\mu \nu }(q)/M. \nonumber \label{{}\end{{eqnarray} % Then $ \Delta {{\cal A}^\epsilon _{{J}$ yields the additional \ind{{effective potential} % \begin{{equation} \label{{10.98} V_{{\rm eff} =-\frac{{\hbar ^2}{{6M}\bar R, \end{{equation} % where $ \bar R$ is the Riemann curvature scalar.

It goes without saying that the path integral (\ref{{10.99}) also has a phase space version. It is obtained by omitting all $(M/2\epsilon )(\Delta q_n)^2$ terms in the short-time actions ${{\cal A}^\epsilon$ and extending the multiple integral by the product of momentum integrals % \begin{{eqnarray} \prod _{{n=1}^{{N+1}\left[ \frac{{dp_n}{{2\pi \hbar \sqrt{{g(q_n)} } \right] e^{{(i/\hbar )\sum _{{n=1}^{{N+1}\left[ p_{{n\mu }\Delta q^\mu -\epsilon\frac{{1}{{2M}g^{{\mu \nu }(q_n) p_{{n\mu }p_{{n\nu } \right]} {{}. \label{{}\end{{eqnarray} % When using this expression, all problems which were encountered  in the literature with canonical transformations of path integrals disappear.    \newpage % \section{{The Pet Model in One Time Dimension}   % Equipped with thegeneral theory of path integrals in curved spaces we are ready to attack the bosonization problem. To become familiar with the subject, consider first a most elementary fermion theory described by a Hamiltonian operator   % \begin{{eqnarray}   \hat H =  \frac{{ \ener }{{2} (\hat a^\sdag  \hat a)^2 \label{{6.1}\end{{eqnarray} % where $\hat a^\sdag , \hat a$ denote creation and annihilation operators of a fermion at a point. To see the difference with respect to boson operators, we shall discuss both options at the same time. \subsection{{Hilbert Space and Generating Functional} The states are % % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{}  |n\rangle  = \frac{{1}             {{\sqrt{{ n!}} (\hat a^\sdag )^n | 0 \rangle ,~~~~n=0,1,\dots~, \label{{6.2}\end{{eqnarray} % with energies % \begin{{eqnarray}   E_n = \frac{{\ener}{{2}{{n^2} . \label{{6.3b}\end{{eqnarray} % In the boson case, the quantum number $n$ can run from $0$ to infinity, in the fermion case it may take only the values $0$ and $1$, i.e., the energies are % \begin{{eqnarray}    E_0 & = & 0 \mbox{{~~~~for~~~} | 0 \rangle\nonumber  \\    E_1 & = & \frac{{ \ener }{{2} \mbox{{~~~for~~~} |1\rangle  = a^\sdag            |0\rangle . \label{{6.3}\end{{eqnarray} % The generating functional of all correlation functions of the system is defined by % \begin{{eqnarray}    Z [\eta^* , \eta ]  =  \Tr \left\{{e^{{-i \hat H (t_b-t_a)}\hat T \exp \left[       i\int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt (\eta^* \hat  a + \hat a^\sdag \eta)\right]\right\}, \label{{6.5o}\end{{eqnarray} % where $\hat T$ is the time ordering operator and $ \eta (t), \eta^* (t)$ are external sources, which are anticommuting Grassmann variables for fermions. The $n$-point correlation functions are obtained from the $n$th functional derivatives of $ Z [\eta^* , \eta ]$.  $ Z [\eta^* , \eta ]$.   The classical Lagrangian of the system is % \begin{{eqnarray}      {{L} (t) = a^*  (t) i \partial _t a (t)       - \frac{{ \ener}2 \left[ a^* (t) a(t)\right] ^2, \label{{6.4}\end{{eqnarray} % and the path integral representation for the generating functional (\ref{{6.5o}) takes the form % \begin{{eqnarray}    Z [\eta^* , \eta ]  = \int {{{{\cal D}} a^*  {{\cal D}a \exp \left[ i \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \left( {{L}        + \eta^* a + a^* \eta\right) \right], \label{{6.5}\end{{eqnarray} % where $\hat T$ is the time ordering operator. For the sake of generality, we first consider a finite time interval $(t_a,t_b)$ which will eventually be extended to the entire time axis. The fields $a^*(t), a(t)$ satisfy  periodic of antiperiodic boundary conditions in the bosonic or fermionic case: % \begin{{equation} a(t_b)=\pm a(t_a),~~~~~~~ a^*(t_b)=\pm a^*(t_a),~~~ \label{{abc}\end{{equation} %  As long as $t_b-t_a$  is finite, the  generating functional at zero currents $ \eta(t),  \eta^*(t)$ is known: % \begin{{equation} Z\equiv Z[0,0]=\sum_n e^{{-i(t_b-t_a) E_n}, \label{{partf}\end{{equation} % where the summation index runs from $n=0$ to infinity for bosons and from $0$ to $1$ for fermions, in accordance with the spectra (\ref{{6.2}) and (\ref{{6.3}). The expression (\ref{{partf}) is the real-time version of the partition function of the system corresponding to an imaginary inverse temperature $ \beta=i (t_b-t_a)$. This follows directly from the spectra (\ref{{6.3b}) or  (\ref{{6.3}), and can easily be calculated via path integrals following standard methods (for instance those in Chapter 2 in Ref. \cite{{PI}).  \subsection{{Collective Quantum Field}  We now introduce a collective quantum field into the path integral via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation formula \cite{{hs} % \begin{{eqnarray}   \exp \left\{{ -i \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt  \frac{{\ener}2 [a^\sdag  a(t)]^2\right\} =    \int {{\cal  D}\rho (t) \exp \left\{{ {{i} \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \left[\frac{{1}{{2 \ener } \rho ^2    (t) - \rho (t) a^\sdag  a(t)\right] \right\} \label{{6.6}\end{{eqnarray} % which amounts to multiplying (\ref{{6.5}) by the trivial unit factor $$  \int {{\cal  D}\rho (t) \exp \left\{{\frac{{i}{{2 \ener } \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \left[      \rho  (t) -  s(t)\right]\right\}\equiv 1 $$ with ${{s}(t)=\ener  a^\sdag  a(t)$, and integrating out the $\rho $-field. Note that because of (\ref{{abc}), the composite filed $a^* (t) a(t)$, and thus also the field $ \rho(t)$ satisfy periodic boundary conditions on the interval $(t_a,t_b)$. Thus it has the Fourier decomposition % \begin{{equation}   \rho(t) = \rho_0+\rho'(t);~~~~{{\rm with}~~~\rho'(t)\equiv \sum_{{m=\pm 1,\pm2,\dots}(\rho_m e^{{i\omega_mt}+{{\rm c.c.}), \label{{fdec}\end{{equation} % with the frequencies $\omega_m\equiv 2\pi/(t_b-t_a)$. The zero-frequency component $\rho_0$ is the temporal average $\rho_0=\int _{{t_a}^{{t_b}dt\rho(t)/(t_b-t_a)$; the field $\rho'(t)$ has a  zero average.  In terms of the Fourier components, the measure path integration for $ \rho(t)$ is % \begin{{equation}  \int {{\cal D} \rho\approx\int \frac{{d \rho_0}{{ \sqrt{{2\pi \ener/ i\Delta t} } \prod_{{m=\pm1,\pm2,\dots} \frac{{d {{\rm \,Re~}\rho_m}{{ \sqrt{{\pi \ener/i\Delta t} } \frac{{d {{\rm \,Im~}\rho_m}{{ \sqrt{{\pi \ener/i \Delta t} }, \label{{rhomeas}\end{{equation} % where $ \Delta t\equiv  (t_b-t_a)$. The resulting generating functional $Z$ may be written as % \begin{{eqnarray}  Z[\eta^* , \eta] &=&  \int {{\cal D}a^*  {{\cal D}a {{\cal D}\rho  \nonumber \\{{}    & &\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\times  \exp \left\{{i \int _{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \left[ a^* (t) i \partial _t a(t)          - \rho (t) a^* (t) a (t) + \frac{{\rho ^2(t)}{{2 \ener } + \eta^*  (t)a(t)            + a^*  (t)\eta(t) \right] \right\}, \label{{6.7}\end{{eqnarray} % where the path integral ${{\cal D}\rho$ may be performed by integrating over all Fourier components in the standard way.  Classically, the collective field is proportional to the particle density. Indeed, by extremizing the action in (\ref{{6.7}) we find the relation % \begin{{eqnarray}   \rho (t) =  \ener a^\sdag  (t) a (t). \label{{6.8}\end{{eqnarray} %     Integrating out the $a^* ,a$ fields in (\ref{{6.7})    gives     % \begin{{eqnarray}   Z[\eta^* , \eta] & = &  \int {{\cal D} \rho  \exp \left\{{ i {{\cal A}              [\rho ] - \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt dt' \eta^*  (t) G_\rho  (t,t')               \eta (t')\right\} \label{{6.9}\end{{eqnarray} % with the collective field action \begin{{eqnarray}  {{\cal A} [\rho ] = \mp i \log{{\rm Det} ( G_\rho/i) + \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \frac{{\rho ^2(t)}{{2 \ener } = \pm i \Tr\log (i G_\rho^{{-1}) +\int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \frac{{\rho ^2(t)}{{2 \ener }, \label{{6.9a}\end{{eqnarray} % where $G_\rho $ denotes the Green function of the fundamental particles in an external potential  $\rho (t)$, satisfying the differential equation % \begin{{eqnarray}    \left[ i \partial _t - \rho (t)\right]  G_\rho  (t,t')       = i\delta (t-t'). \label{{6.10}\end{{eqnarray} % This equation may be solved by introducing an auxiliary field % \begin{{eqnarray}   \varphi (t) \equiv \int_{{t_a}^{{t} dt'  \rho' (t')+{{\rm const}. \label{{} \end{{eqnarray} % Inserting the Fourier decomposition (\ref{{fdec}) we may take  \begin{{eqnarray}   \varphi (t) = \sum_{{m=\pm 1,\pm2,\dots}(\varphi_m e^{{i\omega_m t}+{{\rm c.c.}) =\sum_{{m=\pm 1,\pm2,\dots}\frac{{1}{{i\omega_m}(\rho_m e^{{i\omega_m t}-{{\rm c.c.}), \label{{frvarphi} \end{{eqnarray} which is a periodic function with a vanishing average. Then we write Eq. (\ref{{6.10}) as \begin{{eqnarray}    \left[ i \partial _t - \rho_0-\dot\varphi (t)\right]  G_{{\rho}  (t,t')       = i\delta (t-t'). \label{{6.10}\end{{eqnarray} This is solved by % \begin{{eqnarray}   G_\rho (t,t') = e^{{-i\varphi (t)}             e^{{i\varphi (t')}             G_{{\rho_0}  (t,t'), \label{{6.11}\end{{eqnarray} % with $G_{{\rho_0}  $ being the Green function of the fundamental field $ a(t)$ for a constant field $ \rho (t)\equiv  \rho_0 $, satisfying the equation % \begin{{eqnarray}   [ i \partial _t G_{{\rho_0}  (t,t')-\rho_0]       = i\delta (t-t'), \label{{6.10free}\end{{eqnarray} % and describes the propagation of the fields  $a^\sdag_{{\rho_0}(t), a_{{\rho_0}(t)$ with a Lagrangian \begin{{eqnarray}      {{L}_{{\rho_0} (t) =  a^\sdag_{{\rho_0}   (t) i \partial _t a_{{\rho_0} (t) - \rho_0 a^\sdag_{{\rho_0}   (t)  a_{{\rho_0} (t). \label{{6.4om}\end{{eqnarray} This is the Lagrangian of a harmonic oscillator of frequency $\omega=\rho_0$. The Green function satisfies  periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions in the time interval $(t_a,t_b)$ for bosons or fermions, respectively.   For an infinite time interval, the solution of (\ref{{6.10free}) is very simple: % \begin{{equation} \label{{3.52} G_{{\rho_0} (t,t')=e^{{-i{{\rho_0} (t-t')}\Theta (t-t') \end{{equation} for both bosons and fermions.    For a finite interval, the right-hand side must be made periodic or antiperiodic by adding the repetitions, and we find: % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{3.53} G _{{\rho_0} (t,t') = \sum_{{n=-\infty }^{{\infty }    (\pm 1)^n  e^{{-i{{\rho_0}  [t-t'-(t_b-t_a)n]} \Theta (t-t'-(t_b-t_a)n) . \end{{eqnarray} % The  explicit  evaluation of the sum on the right-hand side  may be restricted to the basic interval % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{3.54} t-t' \in [0, t_b-t_a), \end{{eqnarray} % where the sum yields in the periodic case % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{3.55} G _{{\rho_0} (t,t') & = & \sum_{{n=-{{\infty} }^{{0 }      e^{{-i{{\rho_0} [t-t'-(t_b-t_a)n]} =      \frac{{e^{{-i{{\rho_0} (t-t')}}{{1 - e^{{-i{{\rho_0} (t_b-t_a)}}\nonumber\\  & =  & -i \frac{{e^{{-i{{\rho_0} [t-t'-(t_b-t_a)/2]}}        {{2 \sin [{{\rho_0} (t_b-t_a)/2]}, ~~~t-t' \in         [0, t_b-t_a ). \end{{eqnarray} % %   In the antiperiodic case, we find % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{3.72} G_{{\rho_0} (t,t') & = & \sum_{{n=-{{\infty} }^{{0 } e^{{-i{{\rho_0} [t-t'-(t_b-t_a)n]}             (-)^{{ n}         = \frac{{e^{{i{{\rho_0} (t-t')}}{{1+e^{{-i{{\rho_0} (t_b-t_a)}} \nonumber \\ &               =& \frac{{e^{{-i{{\rho_0} [t-t'-(t_b-t_a)/2]}}                  {{2\cos [{{\rho_0} (t_b-t_a)/2]} ,~~~t-t'\in[0,t_b-t_a). \end{{eqnarray} % to be extended outside the interval $t\in [0,t_b-t_a)$ by antiperiodicity.  In the original operator language of Eqs. (\ref{{6.1}) and (\ref{{6.5o}), the Green function $G_{{\rho_0} (t,t')$ is  equal to the average operator expectation % \begin{{equation} G_{{\rho_0} (t,t')  =\langle \hat a(t)\hat a^\sdag(t')\rangle_{{ \rho_0}\equiv \frac{{\Tr \left\{{e^{{-i   \rho_0\hat  a^\sdag\hat  a (t_b-t_a)}\hat T \hat a(t)\hat a^\sdag(t')\right\}} {{ \Tr \left\{{e^{{-i   \rho_0\hat  a^\sdag\hat  a (t_b-t_a)} \right\}}. \label{{grho}\end{{equation} % For an oscillator state $|n\rangle$, we find an individual quantum mechanical expectation  % \begin{{eqnarray}       {{}^n G_{{ \rho_0} (t,t') & = &e^{{-i \rho_0(t-t')} \langle n |\hat  T \left( \hat a_{{ \rho_0} (t)\hat  a_{{ \rho_0}^\sdag (t')        \right) | n \rangle \nonumber \\        & = & ( n+1) \Theta ( t-t')\pm n \Theta  (t' - t). \label{{6.31}\end{{eqnarray} %   For fermions, only $n=0$ and $n=1$ contribute. % The expectation (\ref{{grho}) is obtained by averaging these expressions with a pseudo-Boltzmann weight factor $e^{{-i \rho_0 n (t_b-t_a)}$. The result coincides, of course, with (\ref{{3.55}) and (\ref{{3.72}).   The collective field action (\ref{{6.9a}) contains the Tr log of the inverse Green function $G_ \rho(t,t')$. To  evaluate this, we calculate its functional derivative: % \begin{{eqnarray}   \frac{{\delta }{{\delta \rho (t)} \left[ \pm     i \Tr \log (i G_\rho ^{{-1})\right] = \mp      G_\rho  (t,t') |_{{t'=t+\epsilon } , \label{{6.14}\end{{eqnarray} %  where the $t' \rightarrow t$ limit is specified in such  a way that the  field $\rho (t)$ couples to the expectation  % \begin{{eqnarray}   \langle \hat a^\sdag (t)\hat  a(t)\rangle_{{ \rho_0} = \pm  \langle{{\hat T} \left(  {{\hat a} (t) {{\hat a}^\sdag  (t')\right) \rangle_{{ \rho_0}  |_{{t'=t + \epsilon} = \pm G_\rho (t,t') |_{{t'=t+\epsilon }. \label{{p.33} \end{{eqnarray} % This specification assumes that the terms $ \int _{{t_a}^{{t_b} (- dt \rho (t) a^* (t) a (t)+ \rho^2(t)/2\ener) $ in the time-sliced version of the path integral (\ref{{6.7}) have the form $ \epsilon\sum _{{n=1}^{{N+1}  [-\rho_n (t) a^* (t_n) a (t_{{n-1})+ \rho_n^2/2\ener] $, with the time of $a^*$ coming {{\em after\/} the time of $a$ ($ \epsilon$ is the thickness of the time slices).  For an infinite time interval, the right-hand side  of (\ref{{6.14}) vanishes trivially due to the $\Theta$-function in (\ref{{3.52}). For finite $t_b-t_a$, the  right-hand side is nonzero. Inserting the solution (\ref{{6.11}), we see that the $ \varphi(t)$-dependence cancels due to the equality of the time arguments and we can replace (\ref{{6.14}) by % \begin{{eqnarray}   \frac{{\delta }{{\delta \rho (t)} \left[ \pm     i \Tr \log (i G_\rho ^{{-1})\right] = \mp      G_{{\rho_0}  (t,t') |_{{t'=t+\epsilon }. \label{{6.14r}\end{{eqnarray} % Due to the constancy of $ \rho_0$, the  right-hand side is constant. It is equal to the negative average particle number $ \bar n$ of a harmonic oscillator of frequency $ \rho_0$: % \begin{{equation}  \pm      G_{{\rho_0}  (t,t') |_{{t'=t+\epsilon }= \bar n= \langle \hat a^\sdag\hat a\rangle_{{ \rho_0} \equiv \frac{{\Tr \left\{{e^{{-i   \rho_0\hat  a^\sdag\hat  a (t_b-t_a)} \hat a^\sdag\hat a\right\}}{{ \Tr \left\{{e^{{-i   \rho_0\hat  a^\sdag\hat  a (t_b-t_a)} \right\}}=   \frac{{1}{{ e^{{-i{{\rho_0} (t_b-t_a)}\mp1}. \label{{grhop}\end{{equation} Integrating the functional differential equation \begin{{eqnarray}   \frac{{\delta }{{\delta \rho (t)} \left[ \pm     i \Tr \log (i G_\rho ^{{-1})\right] = -\bar n \label{{6.14r}\end{{eqnarray} % we find % \begin{{equation} \pm     i \Tr \log (i G_\rho ^{{-1}) =\pm     i \Tr \log (i G_{{\rho_0} ^{{-1}) -\bar n \int _{{t_a}^{{t_b}dt  \rho'(t). \label{{}\end{{equation} % The $ \rho'(t)$-term, however,  vanishes due to the periodicity of $ \rho'(t)$, so that $\pm     i \Tr \log (i G_\rho ^{{-1}) $ coincides with $\pm     i \Tr \log (i G_{{\rho_0} ^{{-1}) $. The associated  functional determinant is equal to a real-time version of the partition function  of a harmonic oscillator of frequency $ \omega= \rho_0$: % \begin{{equation} [\Det (G_{{ \rho_0+\dot\varphi}/i)]^{{\pm 1} \equiv [\Det (G_{{ \rho_0}/i)]^{{\pm 1}=Z_{{ \rho_0}= \left\{{ % \begin{{array}{{c} [1-e^{{-i {{\Delta} t   {{\rho}_0}]^{{-1} {{}\\ 1+e^{{-i {{\Delta} t   {{\rho}_0} \end{{array} % \right\} \label{{pfns}\end{{equation} % This can be written as a spectral sum \begin{{eqnarray} Z_{{ \rho_0}\equiv \left\{{ % \begin{{array}{{c} [1-e^{{- i\Delta t   \rho_0}]^{{-1}\\ 1+e^{{- i\Delta t   \rho_0} \end{{array} % \right\}=\sum_{{n}e^{{-i\Delta t   \rho_0}, \label{{sumform}\end{{eqnarray} % where the summation index $n$ has the same ranges for bosons and fermions as in  Eqs.~(\ref{{partf}).      With these results, the generating functional (\ref{{6.9}) takes the final form  % \begin{{eqnarray}  \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!Z[\eta^* , \eta]& =&  \int \frac{{d \rho_0}{{ \sqrt{{ 2\pi \ener/ i\Delta t}} e^{{i \Delta t\, \rho_0^2/2\ener} Z_{{ \rho_0}    \nonumber \\  &&\times\int {{\cal D} \varphi (t) \label{{6.15gen}    \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{2 \ener } \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt\dot\varphi^2(t) %\mp    \Tr \log \left( iG_{{  \rho_0+\dot\varphi} ^{{-1} \right)                     - \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt dt' \eta^*  (t) \eta(t')           e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')}           G_{{\rho_0}(t,t') \right]. \end{{eqnarray} % % We have changed the integration variables from $ \rho'(t)$ to $\varphi(t)$. From the measure of $ \rho$-integration (\ref{{rhomeas}) we see that % \begin{{equation}  \int {{\cal D}\varphi\approx \prod_{{m=\pm1,\pm2,\dots}\int \frac{{d {{\rm \,Re~}\varphi_m}{{ \sqrt{{\pi \ener/i \omega_m^2\Delta t\,} } \frac{{d {{\rm \,Im~}\varphi_m}{{ \sqrt{{\pi \ener/i  \omega_m^2\Delta t\, } }, \label{{phimeas}\end{{equation} %  since the Fourier components of $\rho' (t) $ in the integration measure of (\ref{{6.7}) and those of $\varphi(t)$ in (\ref{{6.15gen}) are related by  $\rho_m=i\omega_m \varphi_m$. The factors $\omega_m$ are necessary to define the correct path integral of  a field with a kinetic term $\dot\varphi^2(t)$ (see the measure discussion in Ref. \cite{{PI}, Section 2.13). Since $ \varphi (t)$ is a massless field, the product of integrals does not include  the zero-frequency mode of $ \varphi(t)$ --- otherwise the partition function would not exist.  The factors $\omega_m$ are in accordance with the formal functional Jacobian:    % \begin{{eqnarray}  {{\cal D} \rho = {{\cal D} \varphi  \det \left[ \dot{{\delta } (t-t')\right]            = {{\rm const}\cdot {{\cal D} \varphi, \label{{jac} \end{{eqnarray} % where the constant is the product of all frequency eigenvalues.    Observe that it is $\varphi (t)$ which becomes a convenient dynamical   plasmon variable, not $\rho (t)$ itself. The original theory has been transformed to a new one involving bosons of zero mass. In realistic electron gases they describe plasma excitations \cite{{cqf}. For this reason, we refer to the field $\varphi$ in the exponent of (\ref{{6.15}) as the {{\em plasmon\/} field \cite{{cqf}.  \section{{Comparison Between Original and Bosonized Formulations}  To see how the bosonization works in detail, let us calculate several properties of the model in the two equivalent formulations. \subsection{{Partition Function} We begin with the generating functional at zero external currents, the real-time version of the quantum partition function. Using the Hamilton operator (\ref{{6.1}), we have % \begin{{equation} Z= Z [0 , 0 ]        = \Tr e^{{-i \Delta t\ener( a^\sdag a)^2/2}=\sum _{{n} e^{{-i \Delta t gn^2/2}, \label{{zsum}\end{{equation} % where the summation index has the same ranges for bosons and fermions  as in Eqs.~(\ref{{partf}) and (\ref{{sumform}).  The same result is, of course, obtained from the path integral representation (\ref{{6.5}): % \begin{{eqnarray}   Z= Z [0 , 0 ]        =  \int {{{{\cal D}} a^*  {{\cal D}a \exp \left[ i \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt  {{L}         \right] , \label{{6.5zero}\end{{eqnarray} if time slicing and measure of integration are defined appropriately \cite{{PI}.  Consider now the bosonized path integral representation (\ref{{6.15gen}) without external sources,  % \begin{{eqnarray}  Z=Z[0 ,0] =  \int \frac{{d \rho_0}{{ \sqrt{{ 2\pi \ener /i\Delta t}}  e^{{i \Delta t\, \rho_0^2/2\ener } Z_{{ \rho_0}  \int {{\cal D} \varphi (t) \label{{6.15genzeronew}    \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{2 \ener } \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt\dot\varphi^2(t)          \right], \end{{eqnarray} % for bosons and fermions, respectively. Inserting the Fourier representation (\ref{{frvarphi}) and using the measure       (\ref{{phimeas}), we see that the path integral over $\varphi$ is equal to unity: % \begin{{equation}  \int {{\cal D} \varphi (t)    \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{2 \ener } \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt\dot\varphi^2(t)          \right]\equiv 1.\label{{unity} \end{{equation} % To perform the integral over $ \rho_0$, we insert for $Z_{{ \rho_0}$ the spectral decomposition (\ref{{sumform}), and (\ref{{6.15genzeronew}) becomes \begin{{eqnarray}  Z=Z[0 ,0] =  \int \frac{{d \rho_0}{{ \sqrt{{ 2\pi \ener /i\Delta t}}  e^{{i \Delta t\, \rho_0^2/2\ener } \sum_{{n}e^{{-i\Delta t   \rho_0}. \label{{6.15genzeronew1} \end{{eqnarray} After a quadratic completion, the integral over $ \rho_0$ can be done and yields precisely the expression (\ref{{zsum}). %  \subsection{{Correlation Functions}  For a calculation of the correlation functions of the original fields $a^*(t)$ and  $a(t)$, we must form the functional derivatives of (\ref{{6.15gen}) with respect to the sources $ \eta^*(t),  \eta(t)$, divide the result by $Z[0,0]$, and set the sources equal to zero. Each pair of differentiations $ \delta/ \delta \eta^*(t)$ and $ \delta/ \delta \eta(t')$ produces a factor $ e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')}           G_{{\rho_0}(t,t')$ in the integrand. The path integral over $\varphi$-fields amounts to calculating the Gaussian  averages of these exponentials. For an arbitrary functional of $\varphi$, these are defined by % \begin{{eqnarray} \langle \left.F[\varphi] \rangle_\varphi\equiv  \int {{\cal D} \varphi (t)  F[\varphi]   \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{2 \ener } \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt\dot\varphi^2(t)          \right] \right/ \int {{\cal D} \varphi (t)     \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{2 \ener } \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt\dot\varphi^2(t)          \right]  .  \label{{phiav}\end{{eqnarray} % By Wick's rule, we know that % \begin{{equation} \langle e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')}\rangle_\varphi= \langle e^{{-i [\varphi (t)-\varphi (t')]} \rangle_\varphi= e^{{-\frac{{1}{{2}\langle [\varphi (t)- \varphi (t')]^2\rangle_\varphi }= e^{{-\frac{{1}{{2}\langle \varphi^2 (t)\rangle_\varphi} e^{{-\frac{{1}{{2}\langle \varphi^2 (t')\rangle_\varphi} e^{{\langle \varphi (t) \varphi (t')\rangle_\varphi} \label{{wicksrule}\end{{equation} % where $\langle \varphi (t) \varphi (t') \rangle_\varphi$ is the correlation function % \begin{{equation} \langle \varphi (t)\varphi(t')\rangle_\varphi=\frac{{2\ener}{{ \Delta t}\sum_{{m=1}^\infty         \frac{{i}{{\omega_m^2}         e^{{-i\omega_m(t-t')} =\frac{{i}{{2}\frac{{|t-t'|^2}{{ \Delta t} -\frac{{i}{{2}|t-t'|+\frac{{i}{{8} \Delta t. \label{{correl}\end{{equation} % Hence % \begin{{equation} \langle e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')} \rangle_\varphi= \exp\left[  \frac{{i}{{2}\frac{{(t-t')^2}{{ \Delta t} -\frac{{i}{{2}|t-t'|\right       ]. \label{{wicksrule2}\end{{equation} % Note that the $t,t'$-independent last term in (\ref{{correl}) has dropped out, so that the correlation function of exponentials $\langle e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')} \rangle_\varphi$ has a finite limit for $ \Delta t\rightarrow \infty$, in contrast to the correlation function of the field $\varphi(t)$ itself.  With the result (\ref{{wicksrule2}) it is easy to calculate the correlation function of a boson or a fermion field. {{}From (\ref{{6.5o}), its operator expression is given by % \begin{{eqnarray} G(t,t')=\langle\hat T\hat  a(t) a^\sdag(t')\rangle= Z^{{-1} \Tr \left[e^{{-i \hat H (t_b-t_a)}\hat T \hat  a(t)\hat  a^\sdag(t')\right]. \label{{6.5gf}\end{{eqnarray} % Inserting a sum over all intermediate states $ \sum_{{n=0}^1 |n\rangle\langle n|=1$, % we find \begin{{eqnarray} G(t,t')= Z^{{-1} \sum _{{n=0}^ \infty e^{{-i \Delta t n^2/2}e^{{i(t-t')\ener n} (n+1),~~~~~~t-t'\in[0,t_b-t_a). \label{{6.5gfsp}\end{{eqnarray} %  The same result is obtained from the bosonic generating functional (\ref{{6.15gen}). For the normalization factor $Z $ in (\ref{{6.5gf}), this has just been shown. Let us calculate the numerator, denoting it by $G_{{\rm N}(t,t')$. Applying to (\ref{{6.15gen}) the  differentiations $ \delta^2/ \delta \eta^*(t)\delta \eta(t')$, we obtain its path integral  % \begin{{eqnarray}  G_{{\rm N}(t,t')& =&  \int \frac{{d \rho_0}{{ \sqrt{{ 2\pi \ener /i\Delta t}}  e^{{i \Delta t\, \rho_0^2/2\ener }Z_{{ \rho_0}  G_{{\rho_0}(t,t') \nonumber \\ &&~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\times \int {{\cal D} \varphi (t) \label{{6.15gencor} e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')}           \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{2 \ener } \int_{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt\dot\varphi^2(t)          \right], \end{{eqnarray} % The second factor is equal to the correlation function (\ref{{wicksrule2}). To evaluate the integral over $ \rho_0$, we write  $ Z_{{ \rho_0}  G_{{\rho_0}(t,t') $ as a spectral sum %[analogous to the numerator in (\ref{{6.5gfsp})] \begin{{eqnarray} G_{{ \rho_0,{{\rm N}}(t,t')= \sum _{{n=0}^ \infty e^{{-i \Delta t  \rho_0 n}e^{{-i\rho_0(t-t')} (n+1) ,~~~~~~t-t'\in[0,t_b-t_a). \label{{6.5gfsp2}\end{{eqnarray} % After a quadratic completion, the integral over $ \rho_0$ can be performed and we obtain precisely the numerator of (\ref{{6.5gfsp}) of the correlation function.   For more than one pair of exponential fields $e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')}$, we have to calculate the expectation of functionals  of the form $ \exp \left[ i \sum _{{i} q_i\hat \varphi (t_i) \right]$ where the numbers $q_i$ have the values  $+ 1$ for an incoming boson or fermion, and $-1$ for an outgoing one. The numbers $q_i$ may be interpreted as the {{\em charges\/} of the fundamental fields. After rewriting % \begin{{eqnarray}     \exp \left[ i \sum _{{i} q_i\hat \varphi (t_i)          \right] =          \exp \left[\int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} dt\hat \varphi (t)             q_i \delta (t-t_i) \right], \end{{eqnarray} % we can again apply Wick's rule (\ref{{wicksrule}) and find % \begin{{eqnarray} && \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! \left\langle \exp \left[\int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} dt\hat \varphi (t)             q_i \delta (t-t_i) \right] \right\rangle_\varphi\\&& \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!=    \exp  \left[ -\frac{{1}{{2} \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} dt dt' \sum _{{i}             q_i \delta (t-t_i) \langle {{\varphi} (t)\varphi (t') \rangle_\varphi \sum _{{j} q_j\delta  (t'-t_j)\right] \nonumber \\            &  & \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!=  \exp \left[ - \frac{{1}{{2} \sum _{{ij} q_i q_j \langle {{\varphi} (t_i)\varphi (t_j) \rangle_\varphi \right] . \label{{}\end{{eqnarray} % Inserting the correlation function (\ref{{correl}), the right-hand side becomes       % \begin{{eqnarray} \exp\left[-i\left(\sum_iq_i\right)^2  \Delta t/16\right] \exp\left\{{-\frac{{i}{{4}\sum _{{i,j}q_iq_j[(t_i-t_j)^2/ \Delta t- |t_i-t_j|] \right\}. \label{{}\end{{eqnarray} Since the external sources $ \eta(t),  \eta^*(t)$ are differentiated pairwise, the total charge $q=\sum _iq_i$ vanishes ({{\em charge neutrality\/}), so that the first exponential is equal to unity, thus ensuring that the expectation has a finite limit for $ \Delta t\rightarrow \infty$: \begin{{eqnarray}       \left\langle  \exp \left[ i \sum _{{i}q_i\hat  \varphi (t_i)\right]  \right \rangle_\varphi      =  \delta_{{\Sigma_i {{q_i},0} \exp \left[                   \frac{{i}{{2} \sum _{{i>j} q_i q_j | t_i -                   t_j | \right] \label{{6.43}\end{{eqnarray} %   It is useful to study the bosonized form of the theory in the operator language to understand the structure of the Hilbert space. For this it is useful to consider the simpler situation of an infinite time interval (corresponding to a zero-temperature equilibrium calculation). Then the integral over $ \rho_0$ in (\ref{{6.15gen}) can be done trivially yielding unity and forcing  $ \rho_0$  to be zero. The Green function coincides with the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product % \begin{{eqnarray}   G_{{0}  (t,t') = \langle 0 |\hat T \left( \hat a_{{0} (t)\hat  a_{{0}^\sdag (t')         \right) |0\rangle  =  \Theta (t-t'), \label{{6.12}\end{{eqnarray} % and (\ref{{6.11}) yields % \begin{{eqnarray}    G_\rho (t,t') =   e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')}          \Theta (t-t'),~~~~t>t'. \label{{6.13}\end{{eqnarray} %  The generating functional is simply  % \begin{{eqnarray}  Z[\eta^* , \eta] =  \int {{\cal D} \varphi (t) \label{{6.15}    \exp \left[ \frac{{i}{{2 \ener } \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} dt\dot\varphi^2(t)  - \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} dt dt' \eta^*  (t) \eta(t')           e^{{-i \varphi (t)} e^{{i\varphi (t')}            \Theta (t-t') \right]. \end{{eqnarray}   To study this theory in the operator language, we take the free plasmon action  % \begin{{eqnarray} {{\cal A}=  \frac{{1}{{2\ener}\int _{{t_a}^{{t_b} dt \dot{{\varphi }^2(t), \label{{6.16}\end{{eqnarray} % go over to the canonical form % \begin{{equation} {{\cal A}= \int _{{t_a}^{{t_b}dt[p(t)\dot \varphi(t)-   \frac{{\ener}{{2} p(t)^2] \label{{}\end{{equation} and identify  the  Hamiltonian as $ H=   \ener p^2/2$. After replacing $p\rightarrow \hat p$, $\varphi\rightarrow \hat \varphi$, which satisfy the canonical equal-time commutation rule % \begin{{equation} [\hat  p(t), \hat \varphi(t)]=-i , \label{{}\end{{equation} % we obtain the Hamilton operator $\hat H=\ener   \hat p^2/2$ of the bosonized model. In the Schr\"odinger representation, the operators $\hat  \varphi$ are diagonalized on states $|\varphi\rangle$ and the functional momentum operator $\hat p$ is represented by the differential operator $-i\partial /\partial\varphi $. The eigenstates of the Hamilton operator $\hat H$ consist initially of plane waves which are eigenstates   of $\hat p $ with arbitrary real eigenvalues $p$: % \begin{{eqnarray}   \left\{{ \varphi |p\right\} =        e^{{i\varphi p }. \label{{6.17}\end{{eqnarray} % We are using curly brackets to  distinguish the Hilbert space of the $ \varphi$-field from that of the original $a^\sdag, a$ fields. The eigenstates (\ref{{6.17}) have the normalization:  % \begin{{eqnarray}    \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty}d\varphi  \left\{{p|     \varphi \right\} \left\{{ \varphi | p'\right\} =2\pi\delta(p-p'). \label{{6.18}\end{{eqnarray} %   In the operator version, the generating functional  (\ref{{6.15})  reads % \begin{{eqnarray}  Z[\eta^* , \eta ] = \frac{{1}{{\left\{{ 0|0\right\}          }   \{{ 0 | T \exp \left[ - \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} dt dt'          \eta^*  (t) \eta (t') e^{{-i\hat \varphi (t)} e^{{i\hat \varphi (t')}                  \Theta (t-t')\right] |0\} \label{{6.19}\end{{eqnarray} % where $\varphi (t)$ are free field operators. The time-ordered operator on the right-hand side is taken between the states of zero-functional momentum.  We can now  generate all Green functions of fundamental particles by forming functional derivatives with respect to $\eta^* , \eta$. First % % \begin{{eqnarray}       \langle 0 |\hat  T \hat a (t) \hat a^\sdag  (t') |0\rangle  & = &              - \left.\frac{{\delta ^{{(2)}Z}{{\delta \eta^*  (t) \delta \eta (t')}               \right.\vert_{{\eta^* , \eta =0} \nonumber \\               & = & \frac{{1}{{\{{ 0 |0\} }                \{{ 0 |  e^{{-i\hat \varphi (t) } e^{{i\hat \varphi (t')}                 | 0\} \Theta (t-t'). \label{{6.20}\end{{eqnarray} % Inserting the time evolution operator % \begin{{eqnarray}    e^{{-i\hat Ht} = e^{{-i  \ener{{\hat p^2}t/{{2}} \label{{6.21}\end{{eqnarray} % the matrix element (\ref{{6.20}) becomes % \begin{{eqnarray} %\label{{} && \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\frac{{1}{{\{{ 0 |0\} }     \{{ 0|   e^{{-i \ener p^2/2} e^{{-i\hat \varphi (0)}           e^{{-i \ener  {{p^2} (t-t')/2} e^{{i\hat \varphi (0)}             e^{{-i \ener {{p^2}t'/2}|0\}  \nonumber \\ &&~~~~~~~= \frac{{1}{{\left\{{ 0|0\right\} }             \{{ 0 | e^{{-i\hat \varphi (0)} e^{{             -i \ener  {{p^2}(t-t')/2} e^{{i\hat \varphi (0)}                |0\} . \label{{6.22}\end{{eqnarray} % But the state $e^{{i\varphi (0)}|0\} $ is an eigenstate   of $p$ with momentum $p=1$, so that (\ref{{6.22}) yields   % \begin{{eqnarray}   \frac{{1}{{\left\{{ 0|0\right\} }\left\{{ 1|1\right\}            e^{{-i \ener (t-t')/2} = e^{{-i \ener (t-t')/2} , \label{{6.23}\end{{eqnarray} %  and the Green function (\ref{{6.20}) becomes  % \begin{{eqnarray} \langle 0| \hat T \hat a(t) \hat a^\sdag (t')|0\rangle = e^{{-i \ener (t-t')/2} \Theta           (t-t'). \label{{6.24}\end{{eqnarray} %  The same result would, of course, have been obtained for the original fundamental fields $\hat a^\sdag (t),\hat a(t)$ using the Hamilton operator (\ref{{6.1}):  % \begin{{eqnarray}    \langle 0|\hat T\hat a(t) \hat a^\sdag (t') |0 \rangle & = &           \Theta (t-t') \langle 0 | e^{{i \ener (\hat a^\sdag \hat a)^2t/2}a(0)                   e^{{-i \ener (\hat a^\sdag \hat a)^2/2(t-t')}                   a^\sdag (0) e^{{-i \ener (\hat a^\sdag \hat a)^2t'/2}|0\rangle \nonumber \\              & = &  \Theta (t-t') e^{{-i \ener (t-t')/2}. \label{{6.25}\end{{eqnarray} %   Observe that nowhere in the calculation has the Fermi or Bose statistics of the operators $\hat a(t)$ and $\hat a^\sdag (t')$ been used. This becomes relevant only for higher Green functions. Expanding the exponential in  (\ref{{6.19}) to the $n$th order gives % \begin{{eqnarray}   Z^{{[n]}\left[ \eta^* ,\eta\right] & =& \frac{{1}{{\{{ 0|0\}}           \frac{{(-)^n}{{n^!} \int_{{-\infty}^{{\infty} dt_1 dt_1' \cdots              dt_n dt_n' \eta^*  (t_1) \eta (t_1')              \cdots \eta^*  (t_n) \eta (t_n')\nonumber \\              &&                             ~~ \times \{{ 0 |T e^{{-i\hat \varphi (t_1)}                e^{{i\hat \varphi (t_1') } \cdots e^{{-i\hat \varphi (t_n)                 } e^{{i\hat \varphi (t_n')} |0 \} \Theta                  (t_1- t_1') \cdots                   \Theta (t_n - t_n'). \label{{6.26}\end{{eqnarray} % The Green function % \begin{{eqnarray}   \langle 0 |\hat T\hat  a (t_1)  \cdots        a (t_n)\hat a^\sdag  (t_n') \cdots \hat a^\sdag          (t_1') | 0 \rangle \label{{6.27}\end{{eqnarray} % is obtained by forming the derivative $$(-i)^{{2n} \frac{{\delta ^{{(2n)}   Z [\eta^*  \eta]}{{\delta \eta^*  (t_1) \cdots  \delta \eta^*  (t_n) \delta \eta (t_n') \cdots  \delta \eta (t)}.$$  There are $(n!)^2$ contributions due to the product  rule of differentiation, $n!$ of them being  identical thereby canceling the factor $1/n!$ in  (\ref{{6.26}). The other correspond, from the point of view  of combinatorics, to all Wick contractions in (\ref{{6.26}),  each contraction being associated with a factor $\langle 0|e^{{-i\hat \varphi (t)}  e^{{i\hat \varphi (t')}|0\rangle $. In addition, the Grassmann nature of source  fields $\eta(t), \eta^*(t)$ causes a minus sign to appear if the contractions  deviating by an odd permutation from the natural order  $11', 22', 33', \dots~$. Denoting  a Wick contraction by a common number on top of a field operator, we obtain for example  % \begin{{eqnarray} \lefteqn{{ \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  \langle 0 |\hat T\hat a(t_1) \hat a(t_2') \hat a^\sdag  (t_2')  \hat a^\sdag  (t_1')|0\rangle               } \nonumber \\{{}    & &=  \langle 0| \hat T \mathop{{a}^1 (t_1)\mathop{{a}^2(t_2) \mathop{{a}^2 {{}^\sdag (t_2')      \mathop{{a}^1{{}^\sdag  (t_1')|0 \rangle  \pm \langle          0 | \hat  T\mathop{{a}^1(t_1) \mathop{{a}^2(t_2)            \mathop{{a}^1{{}^\sdag  (t_2') \mathop{{a}^2{{}^\sdag  (t_1')|0\rangle \nonumber  \\{{}    & & =   \frac{{1}{{\{{ 0|0\} } \{{ 0 |\hat  T               e^{{-i\hat \varphi  (t_1)} e^{{-i\hat \varphi (t_2)}                 e^{{i\hat \varphi (t_2')} e^{{i\hat \varphi (t_1')}                 | 0 \} \nonumber \\      && =\left[\Theta (t_1 - t_1') \Theta (t_2 -t _2') \pm             \Theta (t_1-t_2') \Theta (t_2 -t_1')\right] \label{{6.28}\end{{eqnarray} % where the upper sign holds for bosons, the lower for fermions. The lower sign enforces the Pauli exclusion principle: If $t_1 > t_2 > t_2' > t_1'$ the two contributions cancel, reflecting the fact that no two fermions $a^\sdag (t_2') a^\sdag  (t_1')$ can be created successively on the particle vacuum. For bosons one may insert again the time translation operator (\ref{{6.21}) and complete sets of states $\int   dp | p  \} \{{   p| = 1 $ with the result:   % \begin{{eqnarray}  && \frac{{1}{{\{{ 0 | 0 \} } \int      dp dp' dp''\{{ 0 | e^{{-i\hat \varphi (0)} e^{{-i  \epsilon \lfrac{{p^2}{{2}            (t_1-t_2)}|p\}\{{p| e^{{-i\hat \varphi (0)} e^{{-i \ener {{p'{{}^2}(t_2 -t_2')/2}|p'\} \nonumber \\ &&~~~~~~~~~~\times \{{p'| e^{{i\hat \varphi (0)} e^{{-i  \ener \lfrac{{ p''{{}^2}{{2}                (t_2'-t_1')} |p''\}\{{p''| e^{{i\hat \varphi (0)}|0\} = e^{{-i \ener (t_1-t_2)/2} e^{{-i \ener 2(t_2-t_2')} e^{{-i \ener (t_2'-t_1')/2}. \label{{6.29}\end{{eqnarray} %  where $\{{ 0 | e^{{-i\hat \varphi (0)} | p \} = \delta     (1-p), ~ ~\{{ p | e^{{-i\hat \varphi (0)}| p'\}     = \delta  (p+1 - p')$ has been used. This again agrees with     an operator calculation like (\ref{{6.25}).  We now understand how  the collective quantum field theory works in this model. Its Hilbert space consists of states of ${{\em any}$ functional momenta $|p\rangle $ with $p$=real. When it comes to calculating the Green functions of the fundamental fields of the original theory, however,  only a small portion of this Hilbert space is used. A fermion  can make plasmon transitions back and forth between the ground  state $|0\}$    and the momentum one state $|1\}

Since the work of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio(NJL)\cite{{NJL},  chiral symmetry breaking  have been studied extensively in various models,  e.g. QCD, strong coupling QED\cite{{scqed},  gauged NJL\cite{{KTY,KMY}, etc..  Particularly, the mechanism of dynamical mass generation  has been applied to models beyond the standard model,  for example, walking technicolor\cite{{TC},  top mode standard model\cite{{TMSM}, etc..  In these models, scalar 4-fermion interaction plays an important role.  Such a 4-fermion interaction in $D(2<D<4)$ dimensions,  the Gross-Neveu model\cite{{GN}, has been extensively studied.   Recently dynamical symmetry breaking and dynamical  mass generation in the Thirring model\cite{{Thirring},  which has vector-vector type 4-fermion interaction  in $D$ dimensions$(2<D<4)$, has been studied by many authors  \cite{{Thirring1,iksy,Thirring in inversion}.  Usually the Thirring model is studied in the form where the fermion  has a minimal coupling with a massive vector boson through introduction  of the vector auxiliary field.  Although this theory (as well as original Thirring model)  has no local gauge symmetry, several authors treated  this massive gauge field as a genuine gauge field\cite{{Thirring1}.  Itoh et al. \cite{{iksy} have reformulated Thirring model  as a gauge theory  by using the hidden local symmetry\cite{{hidden local},  and emphasized the advantage of maintaining such a manifest  gauge symmetry in the analysis of Thirring model in terms of SD equation.  Kondo\cite{{Thirring in inversion} further analyzed such a formulation  in terms of the inversion method\cite{{QCD in inversion}.   It would be interesting to consider the critical behavior of the model  in which the above two types of 4-fermi interaction coexist.  Actually, Kim et al.\cite{{korea} studied such a model but without manifest  gauge symmetry.  Due to each of the gauge symmetry their analysis of the SD equation  unfortunately depends on their assumptions.   In this paper, we analyze Gross-Neveu model with Thirring interaction  by introducing hidden local symmetry  and using the inversion method\cite{{QCD in inversion}  instead of SD equation.  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % %     ( * ) part by YAMAWAKI .. % We obtained the generating functional of the next-to-leading order  and the effective potential by the inversion method.  The critical line is obtained in the parameter space $(g,g_v,N)$  where $g$ and $g_v$ are the dimensionless couplings  of Gross-Neveu and Thirring model, respectively,  and $N$ is the number of fermions.  The phase structure drastically changes at g=1  which is the critical coupling of the pure Gross-Neveu model  at the leading order of $1/N$ expansion.  For $g>1$ the phase structure is essentially determined  by the Gross-Neveu interaction being only operative  in the $1/N$-subleading corrections,  while for $g<1$, the the symmetry breaking take place  only due to the subleading effects where the Thirring interaction  yields attractive force to form the condensate  in contrast to the Gross-Neveu interaction which is opposite.  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Following the procedure of Ref.\cite{{iksy},  we reformulate the original theory as a gauge theory  in section \ref{{hidden local symmetry}.  In section \ref{{invpot} and section \ref{{critical},  we calculate the effective potential for the chiral order parameter  $\langle \bar{{\psi}\psi\rangle$, by using the inversion method  in $1/N$ expansion.  Based on this potential, we study spontaneous chiral symmetry  breaking and explicitly obtain the critical surface which is  the boundary between symmetric phase and spontaneously broken phase.  Comparison with the SD equation is discussed in section \ref{{sdkurabe}.     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % % % % % %    file name : svsvsv_n.tex % % % % % \section{{Hidden Local Symmetry} \label{{hidden local symmetry} \indent % % % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%     Let us consider $D$-dimensional  Gross-Neveu model with Thirring interaction $(2<D<4)$.  The Lagrangian is given by  % % \begin{{equation} \tilde{{{{\cal L}}=\bar{{\Psi}(x)i\!\not{{\!\partial}\Psi(x)          +\frac{{G_S}{{2N}(\bar{{\Psi}(x)\Psi(x))^2          -\frac{{G_V}{{2N}(\bar{{\Psi}(x)\gamma^\mu \Psi(x))^2          +J\bar{{\Psi}(x)\Psi(x), \label{{e:1} \end{{equation} % % where $\Psi^a$ is a 4-component Dirac spinor  with index $a$ $(a=1,2,\cdots,N)$  and belongs to a fundamental representation of $U(N)$,  and $\gamma_\mu(\mu=0,1,2,\cdots,D-1)$  are $4\times 4$ matrices satisfying the Clifford algebra  $\{{ \gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu \}=2g_{{\mu\nu}{{\bf 1}$.  Index $a$ will be omitted in the following.  Here we introduced the source $J=\mbox{{constant}$  in order to study $\langle \bar{{\Psi}\Psi \rangle$.  Using the auxiliary field,  we may rewrite this Lagrangian in to the form  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} \tilde{{{{\cal L}}'=\bar{{\Psi}(i\!\not{{\!\partial}+J)\Psi          -\frac{{1}{{2G_S}\sigma^2          -\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}\sigma\bar{{\Psi}\Psi          +\frac{{1}{{2G_V}\tilde{{A}^2_\mu          +\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}\bar{{\Psi}\tilde{{\not{{\!\!A}}\Psi, \label{{e:2} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% where the auxiliary massive vector field $\tilde{{A_\mu}$  corresponding to the current $\bar{{\Psi}\gamma_{{\mu}\Psi$  is not really a gauge boson as it stands,  and this Lagrangian actually has no gauge symmetry.   Itoh et al.\cite{{iksy}  introduced hidden local symmetry to the Thirring model  and treated it really as a gauge theory.  Following the same procedure as in Ref.\cite{{iksy},  we introduce hidden local symmetry to our model.  What we should do is only the following substitution:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % \begin{{equation} \left\{{ \begin{{array}{{ll}  &\Psi=e^{{-i\phi}\psi,\ \ \ \ \ \\  &\tilde{{A}_\mu=A_\mu-\sqrt{{N}\partial_\mu \phi \ .\ \ \ \ \  \end{{array} \right. \label{{e:3} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The Lagrangian(\ref{{e:2}) is written as %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} \tilde{{{{\cal L}}''=\bar{{\psi}(i\!\not{{\!\partial}+J)\psi          -\frac{{1}{{2G_S}\sigma^2          -\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}\sigma\bar{{\psi}\psi          +\frac{{1}{{2G_V}(A_\mu-\sqrt{{N}\partial_\mu\phi)^2          +\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}\bar{{\psi}\not{{\!\!A}\psi\ , \label{{e:4} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% where $\phi$ is the NG boson for $U(1)_{{\mbox{{local}}$ symmetry breaking,  which is to be absorbed into the longitudinal mode of  massless gauge boson $A_\mu$.  $\tilde{{{{\cal L}}''$ is gauge-equivalent  to the Lagrangian $\tilde{{{{\cal L}}'$.  Actually, if we take the unitary gauge ($\theta=-\phi$),  the Lagrangian $\tilde{{{{\cal L}}''$ reduces to $\tilde{{{{\cal L}}'$.  It is noted that  in contrast to $\tilde{{{{\cal L}}'$ which has no gauge symmetry,  $\tilde{{{{\cal L}}''$ has a $U(1)_{{local}$ symmetry:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % \begin{{equation} \left\{{ \begin{{array}{{ll}  &A_\mu\longrightarrow A'_\mu=A_\mu+\sqrt{{N}\partial_\mu\theta\ ,\\  &\psi\longrightarrow \psi'=e^{{i\theta}\psi\ ,\\  &\phi\longrightarrow \phi'=\phi+\theta\ . \end{{array} \right. \label{{e:5} \end{{equation} % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The total Lagrangian can be obtained  by adding to (\ref{{e:4}) the gauge fixing term  and Faddeev-Popov(FP) ghost term:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} {{\cal L}_{{GF+FP}=-i\delta_B(\bar{{c}f[A,c,\bar{{c},B,\phi])\ , \label{{e:6} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% and is invariant under the following BRS transformation:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{eqnarray} \delta_B A_\mu(x)&=&\partial_\mu c(x)\ ,\nonumber\\ \delta_B B(x)&=&0\ ,\nonumber\\ \delta_B c(x)&=&0\ ,\nonumber\\ \delta_B \bar{{c}(x)&=&iB(x)\ ,\nonumber\\ \delta_B \phi(x)&=&\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}c(x)\ ,\nonumber\\ \delta_B \psi(x)&=&\frac{{i}{{\sqrt{{N}}c(x)\psi(x)\ ,\nonumber\\ \delta_B \sigma(x)&=&0\ , \label{{e:7} \end{{eqnarray} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% where $c(x),\bar{{c}(x)$ are the FP ghost fields  and $B(x)$ is the Nakanishi-Lautrap field.  If we chose $f(A,c,\bar{{c},B,\phi)=F(A,\phi)+\frac{{\xi}{{2}B$,  FP ghost is decoupled from the system.  By integrating out $B$,  we can rewrite gauge fixing term ${{\cal L}_{{GF}$ as  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} {{\cal L}_{{GF}=-\frac{{1}{{2\xi}F(A,\phi)^2\ . \label{{e:8} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Here, covariant gauge and $R_\xi$ gauge corresponds to  following choice for $F(A,\phi)$, respectively.  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} F(A,\phi)= \partial^\mu A_\mu :\mbox{{covariant gauge}\ , \label{{e:9.1} \end{{equation} %%%%% \begin{{equation} F(A,\phi)= \partial^\mu A_\mu+\frac{{\sqrt{{N}}{{G_V}\xi\phi:R_\xi \mbox{{ gauge}\ . \label{{e:9.2} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% In the covariant gauge(\ref{{e:9.1}), NG boson $\phi(x)$ is not decoupled  except the Landau gauge$(\xi=0)$.  On the other hand, in the case of $R_{{\xi}$ gauge,  $\phi(x)$ is completely decoupled from the system  and therefore the system can easily be treated\cite{{iksy}.  Here we choose $R_{{\xi}$ gauge.  The total Lagrangian is obtained by adding ${{\cal L}_{{GF}$  to the Lagrangian $\tilde{{{{\cal L}}''$:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} \tilde{{{{\cal L}}'''={{\cal L}+{{\cal L}_\phi\ , \label{{e:10} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} {{\cal L}_\phi=\frac{{N}{{G_V}\left\{{   \frac12 (\partial\phi)^2-\frac{{\xi}{{2G_V}\phi^2   \right\}\ , \label{{e:11} \end{{equation} \begin{{equation} {{\cal L}=\bar{{\psi}(i\!\not{{\!\partial}+J)\psi          +\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}\bar{{\psi}\not{{\!\!A}\psi          -\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}\sigma\bar{{\psi}\psi          -\frac{{1}{{2G_S}\sigma^2          +\frac{{1}{{2G_V}A_\mu^2          -\frac{{1}{{2\xi}(\partial^\mu A_\mu)^2\ , \label{{e:12} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} {{\cal L}=\bar{{\psi}(i\!\not{{\!\partial}+J)\psi           +\frac12 \sigma iG^{{(0)-1}_\sigma\sigma           +\frac12 A^\mu iD^{{(0)-1}_{{\mu\nu}A^\nu           +\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}\bar{{\psi}\not{{\!\!A}\psi           -\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{N}}\sigma\bar{{\psi}\psi\ , \label{{e:13} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% where $G^{{(0)}_{{\sigma}$ and $D^{{(0)}_{{\mu\nu}$  are the tree level scalar propagator  and the tree level gauge boson propagator, respectively,  which are written as  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{eqnarray} G^{{(0)}_{{\sigma}&=&\frac{{i}{{-G_S} \ ,\\ \label{{e:13.1} % D^{{(0)}_{{\mu\nu} &=&i\left\{{   \frac{{1}{{G_V^{{-1}}P^T_{{\mu\nu}   +\left(  \frac{{1}{{G_V^{{-1}+\xi^{{-1}p^2}P^L_{{\mu\nu}  \right)  \right\}\ ,\\ \label{{e:13.2} % P^T_{{\mu\nu}&\equiv &g_{{\mu\nu}-\frac{{p_\mu p_\nu}{{p^2} \ ,\  P^L_{{\mu\nu}\equiv \frac{{p_\mu p_\nu}{{p^2}\ . \label{{e:13.3} \end{{eqnarray} % % % % % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % \section{{Vacuum Polarization} \label{{vacuum polarization} \indent % % % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  In this section,  we calculate the vacuum polarization tensor in the Euclidean space.

Let us consider a graph which contains more than two vertices in Fig.3.  There is at least one tadpole Fig.5.  If we convert this tadpole Fig.5 into a simple tadpole Fig.2,  the order of the graph becomes lower,  and finally we can reduce the graph to Fig.4.

Taking $g_{{Vc}=0$ in the eq.(\ref{{original}),  the critical line of the dynamical symmetry breaking  in the Gross-Neveu model is given by  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} g_c\simeq 1+\frac{{D-1}{{2N_c} +O\left( \frac{{1}{{N_c^2}\log N_c \right) \ . \label{{e:57} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% It is remarkable that this critical line is exactly the same line  obtained by using SD equation up to the next-to-leading  order of $1/N$ expansion\cite{{wang}.             %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Let us return to (\ref{{original}) to look into the critical surface  of Thirring-Gross-Neveu model.  We consider here $D=3$ for convenience.  Then the critical line is written as  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} g_c=1+\frac{{1-2H(g_{{Vc})}{{N_c}\ , \label{{e:101} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% where $H(z)$ is defined by  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} H(z) \equiv 1 - \frac{{1}{{z}\log (1+z)\ . \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % % $H(z)$ is monotonically increasing function and $H(0)=0, H(\infty)=1$.  Since $0\leq H\leq 1$ and $N\geq 1$, we find $g_c <2$ in (\ref{{e:101}).  The critical line in the ($g_{{V},N$) plane is given  in FIG.A-1 and FIG.A-2 for various values of $g$.   We here divide the region $0<g<2$ into three regions,  (1)$g>2$, (2)$0<g<1$(FIG.A-1) and (3)$1<g<2$(FIG.A-2),  where $g=1$ is the value of critical coupling constant  at the leading order of the Gross-Neveu model.  The forms of critical line in these region are different from  each other as follows:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \\ (1) $g>2$  In this case, the chiral symmetry is always broken  irrespectively of $g_V$ and $N$.  \\ %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% (2) $1<g<2$ (FIG.A-1)  In this region, the critical line (\ref{{e:101}) reads  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} N_c = \frac{{1-2H(g_{{Vc})}{{g_c-1}<\frac{{1}{{g_c-1} \ \ . \label{{e:102} \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% For $g>1$, $g_{{Vc}$ can take a value  which satisfy the equation $2H(g_{{Vc})<1$.  The critical line exists only in the region $N\leq \frac{{1}{{g_c-1}$  and $N_c$ decreases as $g_{{Vc}$ increases  as shown in FIG.A-1.  The symmetry is dynamically broken when $N>\frac{{1}{{g_c-1}$.  \\ %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% (3) $0<g<1$ (FIG.A-2)  In this case, $N_c$ increases according to increasing $g_{{Vc}$  and there exists a critical value of $N_c$:  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{equation} N_c = \frac{{2H(g_{{Vc})-1}{{1-g_c}  < N_c(g_c,g_{{Vc}=\infty)=\frac{{1}{{1-g_c}\ . \end{{equation} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The dynamical symmetry breaking does not occur when $N>N_c(g_c,\infty)$.  This critical line is quite similar to  the critical line obtained in the Thirring model \cite{{iksy}\cite{{Thirring in inversion}.  Thirring interaction strongly affect the system in this region, $0<g<1$.  Thus, the property of the critical line is drastically changed at $g=1$.        This can be understood naturally as follows.  $g=1$ is the critical coupling constant of the Gross-Neveu model  at the leading order of $1/N$ expansion,  and Thirring interaction does not strongly affect the leading order.  Therefore, for $g>1$, Gross-Neveu interaction is dominant.  The system behaves like the Gross-Neveu model,  and the symmetry is broken almost all the region.  As $N$ increases,  the effect of $1/N$ next-to-leading order becomes small,  and the system is dominated by the tadpole of the leading order.  Therefore the dynamical symmetry breaking occur  in large $N$ region for $g>1$.     On the other hand,  the critical behavior is quite different in $0<g<1$.  In this region, the Thirring interaction strongly affects the system,  and the system (or the critical line) becomes Thirring-like.  There exists a critical value for $N$, $N_c(g_c,g_{{Vc}=\infty)<\infty$.  The dynamical symmetry breaking does not occur in the large $N$ region,  $N>N_c(g_{{Vc}=\infty,g_c)$,  even if $g_V\longrightarrow\infty$.  The symmetry is broken in the small $N$ region.  This is in contrast to the case $1<g<2$  where the system behaves like Gross-Neveu model.     Thus the critical behavior drastically changes at $g=1$.  The system behaves like Thirring model in $g<1$,  whereas it does like Gross-Neveu model in $g>1$.  % % % % % % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %  end of Svsvsv_n.tex  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%            %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %             conclusion and discussion                       %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \section{{Conclusion and Discussion} \label{{sdkurabe} \indent       In this paper, we have constructed the effective potential  for the order parameter of the chiral symmetry,  the fermion condensate $\langle\bar{{\psi}\psi\rangle$  in the hybrid model of the Gross Neveu model  and the Thirring model in $D(2<D<4)$ dimensions.  From this potential, we have shown existence of the chiral  symmetry breaking and explicitly obtained the critical surface.    We have analysed our model using the inversion method in $1/N$ expansion.  In this model, existence of Gross-Neveu interaction make  our analysis complicated.  So many diagrams contribute to the generating functional.  But we found we do not have to calculate all the diagrams.  We have expanded the generating functional $W[J]$  in terms of the infinitesimal source $J$,  and estimate it on the order $O(J^{{D})$.  In section\ref{{jbeki},  we investigated systematically the order of diagrams  with respect to source $J$,  and determine  which diagram contributes to the generating functional $W[J]$  or effective potential $V(\langle\bar{{\psi}\psi\rangle)$.  Resultant effective potential has no gauge dependence,  because we calculated all diagrams through vacuum polarization.     From this effective potential, we obtained explicitly the critical surface  which separates symmetric phase and broken phase of the chiral symmetry.  Especially, if we consider the special case $g_{{V}=0$ (Gross-Neveu model),  our result(\ref{{e:57}) reproduces exactly the same result obtained  by using SD equation\cite{{wang}.      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %            comparison to the SD equation                    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    Kim et al.\cite{{korea} have already studied Thirring Gross-Neveu model  by using SD equation and they found critical surface.  Although the original Lagrangian(\ref{{e:2}) has no gauge symmetry,  they pretended the auxiliary massive vector field as really a gauge field  without introducing hidden local symmetry.  Furthermore,  the SD equation becomes coupled integral equations  for $A(p)$ and $B(p)$ in the full fermion propagator  $S(p)^{{-1}=\not{{\!p}A(p)-B(p)$,  which are difficult to solve.  Therefore additional approximations (or assumptions)  besides $1/N$ expansion were made in their analysis.  They assumed that the form of $A(p)$ can be determine  by using perturbation,  and mass function $B(p)$ can be regarded as a constant.  As a result of such an approximation,  the effects of the next-to-leading order of the Gross-Neveu interaction  were not included.      On the other hand,  we succeeded in obtaining the effective potential  and the critical line without using additional  approximation besides $1/N$ expansion.           %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %         Acknowledgments                                       %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \begin{{center} {{\large Acknowledgments} \end{{center}  The author would like to thank  Prof. K.

But all its success is in the context of perturbation theory. It has long been known that there are potential problems in the foundations of the theory due to the existence of the so-called Landau pole~\cite{{Landau}. In the leading logarithmic calculation one finds  \begin{{equation} \frac{{1}{{e_R^2} - \frac{{1}{{e^2} = \beta_1 \ln\frac{{\Lambda}{{m_R},\; \beta_1 = \frac{{N_f}{{6 \pi^2}, \label{{e} \end{{equation} where $e$ ($e_R$) is the bare (renormalized) charge, $m_R$ is the renormalized fermion mass, $N_f$ is the number of flavors and $\Lambda$ is the ultra-violet cutoff.  When one attempts to send the cutoff to infinity while keeping $e_R$ fixed, one finds that $e$ diverges at \begin{{equation} \Lambda = \Lambda_L \equiv m_R \mbox{{e}^{{\frac{{1}{{\beta_1 e_R^2}}, \end{{equation} the location of the Landau pole.  The problem can also be seen by looking at the gauge invariant part of the photon propagator \begin{{equation}  \frac{{D(k)}{{k^2} = \frac{{1}{{k^2\,[1 - (\beta_1/2) \ln(k^2/m_R^2)]}\,, \label{{D} \end{{equation} which has a ghost pole at $k^2 = \Lambda_L^2$. This would mean that the entire theory is only applicable for momenta smaller than $\Lambda_L$. On the other hand, when one keeps $e$ fixed and sends the cut-off to  infinity, the renormalized charge goes to zero, meaning that the theory is trivial. The situation in two-loop perturbation theory is much the  same. The (renormalized) $\beta$ function \begin{{equation} \beta_R \equiv \left. m_R \frac{{\partial e_R^2}{{\partial m_R}\right|_{{e^2} = \beta_1 e_R^4 + \beta_2 e_R^6 + \cdots \end{{equation} remains positive for all $e_R^2$, and the Landau pole is displaced to lower values  \begin{{equation} \Lambda_L = m_R \mbox{{e}^{{\frac{{1}{{\beta_1 e_R^2}} \left(\frac{{\beta_2 e_R^2}{{\beta_1 +  \beta_2 e_R^2}\right)^{{\frac{{\beta_2}{{\beta_1^2}}\,. \end{{equation}  QED is not the only theory with a Landau pole problem. Every theory which is not asymptotically free suffers from this problem. While  $\Lambda_L \simeq 10^{{227} \, \mbox{{GeV}$ if only the electron is considered, $\Lambda_L \simeq 10^{{34} \, \mbox{{GeV}$ in the Standard Model. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) $\Lambda_L \simeq 10^{{20} \, \mbox{{GeV}$, and in the MSSM with four Higgses,  which offers a solution to the strong CP problem, the Landau pole  moves down to $\Lambda_L \simeq 10^{{17} \, \mbox{{GeV}$~\cite{{Yndurain}. Thus the Landau pole is by no means academic.  To find a solution to this problem, one must consider a non-perturbative formulation of QED.  Thus it is natural to investigate the problem on the lattice. On the lattice the inverse lattice spacing takes over the role of the ultra-violet cut-off,  $a^{{-1} \sim \Lambda$. Early calculations have shown that the non-compact formulation of the theory using staggered fermions undergoes a second order chiral phase transition at strong coupling~\cite{{Kogut,DESY}: \begin{{figure}[b,h] \vspace*{{-7.0cm} \begin{{centering} \epsfig{{figure=fig1.eps,height=11cm,width=10cm} %\caption{{ }  \end{{centering} \vspace*{{-2.0cm} \end{{figure} \noindent The solid line $am = 0$, $m$ being the bare mass, $e^2 > e_c^2$ is a  line of first order chiral phase transitions, where  $a m_R$, $a^3 \langle\bar{{\psi}\psi\rangle \neq 0$, even though the bare mass is zero. The dashed line $am = 0$, $e_c^2 > e^2$ is a line of second  order phase transitions on which $a m_R$,  $a^3 \langle\bar{{\psi}\psi\rangle  = 0$. A meaningful continuum limit can be  taken at the tricritical point  $am = 0$, $e^2 = e_c^2$, because here we can take $a$ to zero while keeping $m_R$ fixed.  %(Note that the lattice spacing  %enters the calculation in the combination $a m_R$.)  To understand the continuum limit of the theory, we need to know the renormalized charge as a function of the cut-off in the  critical region. We have recently computed the chiral condensate on large  lattices~\cite{{eos}. In this letter we compute $a m_R$  and $e_R$   in order to understand the fate of the  Landau pole in QED.   \begin{{figure}[t,h] \begin{{centering} \epsfig{{figure=fig2new.eps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm} \caption{{The renormalized mass against the bare coupling on $12^4$ and $16^4$ lattices.}  \end{{centering} \end{{figure}  \section{{Fermion Mass}  We obtain the renormalized mass from the fermion propagator as outlined in Ref.~\cite{{big}. We are using staggered fermions which in the continuum limit correspond to $N_f = 4$ flavors of dynamical Dirac fermions. The results  are shown in Fig.~1.  Fitting and extrapolating this data it greatly helps that the chiral condensate $\sigma = a^3 \langle\bar{{\psi}\psi\rangle$ is a function of $a m_R$  only~\cite{{big}. In Fig.~2 we plot $\sigma$ as a function of $a m_R$. We  observe that $\sigma$ is well described by the polynomial \begin{{eqnarray} \sigma &=& 0.6197 a m_R - 0.321 (a m_R)^3 + 0.169 (a m_R)^5 \nonumber\\  & &  - 0.040 (a m_R)^7, \label{{pol} \end{{eqnarray} where the first coefficient is given by the one-loop result. This helps because we have already found an equation of state (EOS) that describes the $\sigma$  data~\cite{{eos}. Combining the EOS with the  polynomial (\ref{{pol}) gives the curves shown in Fig.~1 and the extrapolation  to $am = 0$. (Here we have used fit 1 of Ref.~\cite{{eos}. Our results  do not change qualitatively if we use any of the other fits  described there.) For $1/e^2 < 1/e_c^2$ chiral symmetry is broken, and even at  $am = 0$ the renormalized mass is non-zero. This means there is an excluded region shown in white in Fig.~1 (the accessible region being shown in gray).    \section{{Renormalized Charge}  The renormalized charge is obtained from the residue of the photon propagator, $e_R^2 = Z_3 \, e^2$ and  $Z_3 = \lim_{{k\rightarrow 0} \lim_{{V\rightarrow \infty} D(k)$. We can compute $D(k)$ on the lattice, but not at $k = 0$. The smallest momentum  that we  can reach is $2\pi/aL$, \hfill where $L$ is the lattice size ($L = 16$ \\  \begin{{figure}[th] \begin{{centering} \epsfig{{figure=fig3new.eps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm} \caption{{The chiral condensate against the renormalized mass on $12^4$ and $16^4$ lattices.}  \end{{centering} \end{{figure}  \noindent and $12$ in our case). To extrapolate to $k = 0$ we need to make a fit to  the photon propagator. The $k$ dependence of the photon propagator is given by \begin{{equation} \frac{{1}{{e^2 D(k)} - \frac{{1}{{e^2} = - \Pi(k,m_R,L)\,, \end{{equation} where $\Pi$ is the polarization function. In the infinite volume limit we then have \begin{{equation} \frac{{1}{{e_R^2} - \frac{{1}{{e^2} = - \Pi(0,m_R,\infty)\,. \label{{er} \end{{equation} We have already seen that the non-perturbative $\Pi$ is actually very close to the result of one-loop renormalized perturbation theory~\cite{{big}. So it is reasonable to make an ansatz which is inspired by renormalization group improved two-loop perturbation theory. In Ref.~\cite{{Shirkov} it is  shown that to next-to-leading logarithmic order the polarization function can be written  \begin{{equation} \Pi = U - \frac{{V}{{U} \ln(1-e^2U)\,, \end{{equation} where $U$ is the one-loop perturbative result, and $V$ the two-loop one. The lattice result for $U$ is known~\cite{{big}. For $V$ we make the ansatz \begin{{equation} V = v_0 + v_1 U\,. \end{{equation} This is motivated by the small $k^2$ and $m_R^2$ limits. For $a^2 m_R^2 \ll a^2 k^2 \ll 1$ we should have  $V \simeq (\beta_2/2) \ln a^2 k^2$, and for $a^2 k^2 \ll a^2 m_R^2 \ll 1$ we should have $V \simeq (\beta_2/2) \ln a^2 m_R^2$. The one-loop result $U$ has these  properties. We fit this ansatz to a total of 52 photon propagators on  $16^4$ and $12^4$ lattices for various values of $am$,  $e^2$ in the range $0.005 \leq am \leq 0.16$, $0.16 \leq 1/e^2 \leq 0.22$  close to the  critical point at $1/e_c^2 = 0.19040(9)$~\cite{{eos}. \hfill A plot for \\  \begin{{figure}[t,h] \begin{{centering} \epsfig{{figure=fig4new.eps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm} \caption{{The residue of the photon propagator against the momentum for $1/e^2 = 0.20, am = 0.005$ on the $16^4$ lattice. The open  symbols are the data, the solid symbols are the fit.}  \end{{centering} \end{{figure}  \noindent one particular parameter set is shown in Fig.~3. For the fit parameters we obtain $v_0=-0.00207(2)$ and $v_1=-0.0328(7)$, giving $\chi^2/\mbox{{d.o.f.} = 1.7$. Two-loop continuum perturbation theory would give $v_1\equiv\beta_2/\beta_1 = 3/16\pi^2 = 0.0190$. In Fig.~4 we show the resulting $\beta$ function for $e^2 = e_c^2$. We compare this with the one-loop result. We see that the  $\beta$ function is a little smaller  than the one-loop value and is positive.  In particular this means that there is no ultra-violet stable zero in the $\beta$ function out to $e_R^2 = e_c^2$, the maximal value $e_R^2$ can take because $Z_3 \leq 1$~\cite{{BD,Luscher}. As $am_R \rightarrow \infty$ fermion loops are suppressed and  $e_R^2 \rightarrow e^2$, so that the $\beta$ function vanishes. But this is of course not an interesting zero of the $\beta$ function.  \begin{{figure}[b,h] \begin{{centering} \epsfig{{figure=beta.eps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm} \caption{{The $\beta$ function against the renormalized charge. The solid curve is our result, the dashed curve is the lattice one-loop result.}  \end{{centering} \end{{figure} \begin{{figure}[t,h] \begin{{centering} \epsfig{{figure=fig6a.eps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm} \epsfig{{figure=fig6b.eps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm} \caption{{A sketch of the mapping from the bare parameter plane (top) to the renormalized parameter plane (bottom).}  \end{{centering} \end{{figure}  \section{{The Landau Pole}   Having calculated the renormalized mass and charge, we are now able to discuss the mapping from the bare parameters $am$, $e$ to the renormalized parameters $am_R$, $e_R$. Qualitatively this is displayed in Fig.~5. One can choose any $e^2 \geq 0$, $am$ shown in the top part of  the figure by the gray region. This is then mapped onto the corresponding gray region in the bottom part of the figure. The line $am = 0$ from $e^2 = 0$ to  $e^2 = e_c^2$ is mapped onto the point $am_R = e_R^2 = 0$. For $e^2 > e_c^2$ we have already seen in Fig.~1 that  $am_R > 0$, even when $am = 0$, because of chiral symmetry breaking. Thus the line $am = 0$ from $e^2 = e_c^2$ to $e^2 = \infty$ is mapped onto the border line of the gray regions, and the white area is inaccessible for any combination of bare parameters. From this figure we evidently have  triviality. Removing  \begin{{figure}[t,h] \begin{{centering} \epsfig{{figure=fig7a.eps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm} \epsfig{{figure=fig7b.eps,height=7.5cm,width=7.5cm} \caption{{The (quantitative) mapping of the bare parameter plane (top) to the renormalized parameter plane (bottom).}  \end{{centering} \end{{figure} \noindent the cut-off ($a \rightarrow 0$) is only possible at $e_R^2 = 0$. At any  finite value of $e_R^2$ there is a minimal possible value for $|am_R|$,  namely the boundary of the gray region. The position of the  Landau pole is sketched by the dotted line.  We now turn to the quantitative analysis of the problem. In Fig.~6 we plot  again the bare and renormalized planes, this time using $1/e^2$ and  $1/e_R^2$, respectively, as the  horizontal variables because this displays the asymptotic behavior best. The  curves are lines of constant $1/e_R^2$ (top part) and lines of constant $am$ (bottom part), respectively. All lines of constant $e_R^2$ end on the first  order phase transition line, and only  the line $e_R^2 = 0$ goes into the  critical point. This is another expression of triviality of the theory. In the bottom part of the figure the gray region is again the allowed region,  and the white  region is inaccessible. The border line is the line  $am = 0$. From eq.~(\ref{{er}) we find the Landau pole by setting the bare  charge to infinity. This gives the dotted line. We see that it  completely lies in the inaccessible region. It runs roughly parallel to the border line $am = 0$.  We also want to be sure that the photon propagator has no ghost pole for any $k^2$. Beyond leading logarithmic order the extra pole in the photon  propagator and the divergence in $e^2$ need not appear at the same place. The ghost pole position (in the infinite volume) is given by $1/k^2 D(k) = 0$. It has a solution if \begin{{equation} \frac{{1}{{e_R^2} < \max_k \Pi(k,m_R,\infty) - \Pi(0,m_R,\infty). \end{{equation} The solution is given by the dashed line in the bottom part of Fig.~6. This  lies close to the Landau pole, even deeper in the inaccessible region.  \section{{Conclusion}  From Figs.~5,~6 we see that the triviality of QED is intimately connected with chiral symmetry breaking. Any attempt to remove the cut-off is always thwarted by the dynamically generated fermion mass. In particular this means that spinor QED does not exist as an interacting theory, similar to what Coleman and Weinberg~\cite{{CW} found for scalar QED.  We have also seen that chiral symmetry breaking allows QED to escape the Landau pole problem. While the bare parameters of the theory can take any  values, the renormalized parameters are restricted. The Landau pole and ghost problem only occur deep in the inaccessible $e_R^2$, $am_R$ region. Chiral symmetry breaking is always strong enough to push the Landau pole above the cut-off.  \begin{{thebibliography}{{99}  \vspace*{{-1.5cm}  \bibitem{{Landau} L. D.

In seven and in eight dimensions, the corresponding   spaces admit a covariantly constant spinor and, consequently, have holonomies  in $G_2$ and $Spin(7)$, respectively. We find a non-compact  solution to the  self-duality equations in eight dimensions in which the  self-dual  space has  an elliptically-fibered structure.} %\setcounter{{section}{{0} \newpage \section{{Introduction}  Four-dimensional gravitational instantons \cite{{H} have been constructed long-ago and like  their  Yang-Mills ancestors, they are of finite action and  provide tunnelling amplitudes for  distinct gravitational vacua \cite{{EGH}.  In the supergravity context, gravitational  instantons break half of the supersymmetries. For example, for a self-dual  background in the $N=2$ theory,  only the left-handed supersymmetry survives. The broken  one generates fermionic zero modes and give mass to the right-handed  gravitino. Of course, none of these backgrounds is asymptotically Euclidean   as follows from the positive action conjecture \cite{{GHP}.  According to the latter, the action $S$ for any asymptotically Euclidean   space with everywhere vanishing Ricci scalar satisfies $S\geq 0$ where the bound is saturated  for flat space. However, this does not exclude the existence of  asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. Making use of the latter  possibility, instanton solutions have been constructed \cite{{H},\cite{{EH}.   Yang-Mills instantons exist in higher dimensions as well  \cite{{CDFN}--\cite{{GN}.  For example, instantons in seven dimensions with gauge group $G_2$ \cite{{GN}  and in  eight dimensions with gauge groups $SO(8)$ \cite{{GKS} and $SO(7)$ \cite{{FN} have been found.  Their construction started after it was realized that   a higher-dimensional analog of the ordinary four-dimensional self-duality  condition may be written down \cite{{CDFN}.  This condition is based on the octonionic  algebra and leads to solutions similar to  the standard four-dimensional  Yang-Mills instantons. It also provides superstring solitonic  configurations, the octonionic strings,   which preserve 1/16 of the space-time supersymmetries  so that the world-sheet action  has $(0,1)$ supersymmetry \cite{{HS}.  In this case,  although the metric is asymptotically flat, the fields do  not fall fast enough to give a finite ADM mass per unit length to the  octonionic string. This divergence, however, is in the  infrared and  it is of the type already encountered  in the four-dimensional axionic string.    Similarly,  supermembrane solitonic solutions, the octonionic membranes, exist as well \cite{{DM}.  Here, the antiself-dual solution  is asymptotically flat and has finite ADM mass while the self-dual one  is not asymptotically flat. However, both solutions break all of the  space-time supersymmetries.    Recently,  the octonionic self-duality condition has also been formulated for the  supermembrane \cite{{Fairly},\cite{{F2}. It has been used  to  exploit non-perturbative aspects of the vacuum by studying  Nahm-type equations for the tunnelling processes between  classical supermembrane configurations \cite{{FL}. In seven dimensions,  it has been shown that only one supersymmetry survives, while in three  dimensions eight supersymmetries are preserved by the self-dual supermembrane configuration \cite{{FL2}. It is also likely that octonionic  monopole solutions to a Bogomolnyi equation should exist.  The octonionic  algebra has also been employed in the compactifications of the  eleven-dimensional supergravity on the round and squashed seven sphere with or without torsion \cite{{7S}.   Moreover,  generalised self-duality equations for the  p-forms have recently been discussed  \cite{{BL}.    The close resemblance of Yang-Mills and gravitational instantons in  four-dimensions leads to search for higher-dimensional gravitational  instantons as well. Such a programme has not yet been carried out as far as  we know, although some related work had already appeared \cite{{AL}.  Here, we will take first steps towards a systematic approach to these  higher dimensional gravitational instantons.  We will mainly study  eight-dimensional spaces  with ``self-dual'' connection although  a brief discussion for the seven-dimensional case will be given.  We will see that manifolds which satisfy an appropriate self-duality  condition in eight (seven) dimensions have  holonomy in $Spin(7)$ ($G_2$) and this gives a systematic way of constructing such spaces by  solving appropriate first-order equations.   Non-compact manifolds of $Spin(7)$ holonomy have first been constructed in  \cite{{B} and compact ones as $T^8$ orbifolds in \cite{{J7} after appropriate resolving the singularities. Superstring  compactifications  on $Spin(7)$ and $G_2$  manifolds have first been discussed in \cite{{VS} where the corresponding superconformal algebras were given and latter in  \cite{{FFO}. Here,  by solving the eight-dimensional   self-duality  condition we find a space with holonomy in $Spin(7)$.  It has an elliptically-fibered structure where the base is  a sphere and the fibres are three tori which degenerate at  twenty-four points. Its four-dimensional counterpart is the stringy cosmic string \cite{{CS}.   In the following section, we will recall some results concerning the octonionic algebra and its relation to $SO(8)$. In section 3, we will discuss eight-dimensional  self-dual manifolds  and in section 4, we will present a specific solution to the self-duality  condition. Finally, in section 5, we  extend our results  to seven dimensions.            \section{{Octonionic algebra}  We will recall here some properties of the octonionic  (Cayley) algebra ${{\cal{{O}}$ and its relation to $SO(8)$ which we will use  in the sequel. We follow mainly \cite{{GG},\cite{{dN}.  The octonionic algebra is a division  algebra, which means it has a non-degenerate quadratic form $Q$ that satisfies $Q(xy)=Q(x)Q(y)$ and in addition $Q(x)=0$  implies $x=0$. The other division  algebras are the real ${{\cal R}$, complex ${{\cal C}$ and quaternionic  algebras. ${{\cal R}$, ${{\cal C}$ are commutative,  ${{\cal H}$ is non-commutative  while ${{\cal {{O}}$ is neither commutative nor associative.    A basis for ${{\cal{{O}}$ is provided by the eight elements \be 1,~e_a, ~~~~~ a=1,\ldots,7,  \ee which satisfy the relation  \be e_ae_b=\psi_{{abc}e_c-\delta_{{ab}\, . \ee It is similar to the corresponding relation obeyed by the quaternions (Pauli matrices). However, the latter satisfy the Jacobi identity as a  result of the associativity of the quaternionic algebra,  while the octonions $e_a$ are not associative and do not satisfy the Jacobi identity.    The tensor $\psi_{{abc}$ is totally antisymmetric with  \be \psi_{{abc}=+1~~~{{\mbox{{for}}~~~~abc=123,~516,~624,~435,~471~,673,~572. \ee We may also define its dual $\psi_{{abcd}$ as \be \psi_{{abcd}=\frac{{1}{{3!} \epsilon_{{abcdfgh}\psi^{{fgh}\, , \label{{psi} \ee so that  \be \psi_{{abcd}=+1~~~ {{\mbox{{for}}~~~~abcd=1245,~2671,~3526,~4273,~5764,~6431,~ 7531. \ee  They satisfy the relations  \be \psi^{{abc}\psi_{{dhc}&=&\d^a_d\d^b_h-\d^a_h\d^b_d-{{\psi^{{ab}}_{{dh}\, ,  \nonumber\\ \psi^{{abcd}\psi_{{ehcd}&=&4\left(\d^a_e\d^b_h-\d^a_h\d^b_e\right)- 2{{\psi^{{ab}}_{{eh}\, , \nonumber \\ \psi^{{abc}\psi_{{debc}&=&-4{{\psi^{{a}}_{{de}\, .  \ee The tensor $\psi_{{abc}$ can be assigned to an $SO(8)$ representation  $\Psi_{{\a\b\g\d}$, $\a,\ldots=1,\ldots,8$ as \begin{{eqnarray} \Psi_{{\a\b\g 8}=\psi_{{abc}\, , ~~~~ \Psi_{{\a\b\g\d}=\psi_{{abcd}\, , ~~~~~~\a=(a,8)\,\ldots \, , \label{{p} \end{{eqnarray} which is self-dual  \be \Psi_{{\a\b\g\d}=\frac{{1}{{4!}\epsilon_{{\a\b\g\d\zeta\eta\theta\kappa} \Psi^{{\zeta\eta\theta\kappa}\, , \label{{pe} \ee and belongs to one of the three different ${{\bf 35}$'s of $SO(8)$ ${{\bf 35}_v$, ${{\bf 35}_\pm$  (related by triality).

We may also form the $SO(8)$ $\g$-matrices $\Gamma_\a=(\Gamma_a,\Gamma_8)\,,  \a=1,\ldots,8$ \be \Gamma_a=\left(\matrix{{0&i\gamma_a\cr -i\gamma_a&0}\right)\, ,  ~~~~~~ \Gamma_8= \left(\matrix{{0&1\cr 1&0}\right)\, , ~~~~~~~ \{{\Gamma_\a,\Gamma_\b\}=2\d_{{\a\b}\, ,  \ee that correspond to the standard embedding  of $SO(7)_v$ in $SO(8)$.  The latter is defined as the stability subgroup  $SO(7)\subset  SO(8)$ of the vector  representation according to which we have the decomposition \be {{\bf 8}_v={{\bf 7}+{{\bf 1}\, , ~~~{{\bf 8}_{{\pm}={{\bf 8}\, ,  \ee where ${{\bf 8}_v,{{\bf 8}_{{\pm}$ are the vector and the two spinorial  representations of $SO(8)$.   The $SO(8)$ generators $\Gamma^{{ab}=\frac{{1}{{2}[\Gamma^a,\Gamma^b]$  satisfy the relations  \be \Gamma^{{ab}=\psi^{{abc}\Gamma^9\Gamma_{{8c}\, ,~~~ \psi_{{abcd}\Gamma^{{ab}=-(4+2\Gamma^9)\Gamma_{{cd}\, ,   \label{{8c} \ee where, as usual, $\Gamma^9=\left(\matrix{{1&0\cr 0&-1}\right)$ is the chirality  matrix.  It is not then difficult to verify that the generators \be G^{{\a\b}=\frac{{3}{{8}\left(\Gamma^{{\a\b}+\frac{{1}{{6}{{\Psi^{{\a\b}}_{{\g\d} \Gamma^{{\g\d}\right)\, , \label{{G}  \ee leave the right-handed spinor $\eta_+$ invariant \be  G^{{\a\b}\eta_+=0  %~~~~ \eta_\a=\delta_{{8\a} \, . \label{{Gh} \ee The stability  group of $\eta$ is again another $SO(7)$, which we will denote by  $SO(7)^+$, according to which   \be {{\bf 8}_v={{\bf 8}\, , ~~{{\bf 8}_+={{\bf 7}+{{\bf 1}\, ,  ~~{{\bf 8}_-={{\bf 8} \, . \label{{8+} \ee The singlet in the decomposition of ${{\bf 8}_+$ corresponds to the null eigenspinor $\eta$ of $G^{{\a\b}$ in eq.(\ref{{Gh}). This can be seen by  considering the Casimir $G^{{\a\b}G_{{\a\b}$ which has a zero eigenvalue  for the ${{\bf 8}_+$.  If we had used in eq.(\ref{{G}) the second ${{\bf 35}$ of $SO(8)$, the  antiself-dual one, then $G^{{\a\b}$ would annihilate the left-handed  spinor $\eta_-$. In this case, the stability group of the latter  is a  third $SO(7)^-$ subgroup of $SO(8)$ defined by \be {{\bf 8}_v={{\bf 8}\, ,  ~~{{\bf 8}_+={{\bf 8}\,,~~{{\bf 8}_-={{\bf 7}+{{\bf 1}\, . \ee Again, $G^{{\a\b}$ constructed with the antiself-dual ${{\bf 35}$ has a  zero eigenvalue which corresponds to the singlet in ${{\bf 8}_-$.  The three different $SO(7)$ subgroups of $SO(8)$, $SO(7)_v, SO(7)^\pm$ are related by triality.    %\section{{Some properties of $Spin(7)$ manifolds}  %The bosonic part of the eleven-dimensional supergravity is, in an obvious  %notation %\be %S=\frac{{1}{{2\kappa_{{11}^2} %\int d^{{11}x \left(R-\frac{{1}{{2\cdot9!} %F_{{M_1\ldots M_4}F^{{M_1\ldots M_4}+\frac{{2}{{(72)^2} %\epsilon^{{M_1\ldots M_{{11}}F_{{M_1\ldots M_4}F_{{M_5\ldots M_8} %A_{{M_9M_{{10}M_{{11}}\right) %\ee %where $F_{{M_1M_2M_3M_4}=\partial_{{M_1}A_{{M_2M_3M_4}+\!cyclic$ %is the four-form field strength and $\kappa_{{11}$ the $D=11$ gravitational  %coupling constant. By dimensional reduction of the above action we get  %the various supergravity theories. Here, we will discuss vacuum configurations %in eight dimensions which preserve some supersymmetry.   \section{{$Spin(7)$ holonomy spaces}  By dimensional reduction of the eleven-dimensional supergravity, other  supergravity theories are obtained. For example, reduction of the former  on a three torus results in the $N=2$ eight-dimensional supergravity.   The graviton multiplet contains the graviton, an antisymmetric three-form, three two-forms, six one-forms and six scalars and a generic vacuum configuration  breaks  all supersymmetries.  As usual, when all fields vanish except graviton, the condition for unbroken  supersymmetry in a pure gravitational background  is that  the gravitino shifts are zero, i.e.,  \be \delta\psi_\mu^A=\left(\partial_\mu-\frac{{1}{{4}\omega_{{\alpha\beta\mu} \Gamma^{{\alpha\beta}\right)\eta^A =D_\mu\eta^A=0\, , \label{{eta} \ee where $\alpha,\beta,...=1,...,8$ are world indices, $\mu,\nu,...=1,...,8$ curved space ones, $A=1,2$ counts the two supersymmetries of opposite chirality and  $\omega_{{\alpha\beta\mu}$ is the spin connection.  The integrability condition of eq.(\ref{{eta}) is  \be R_{{\a\b\mu\nu}\Gamma^{{\a\b}\eta^A=0\, ,  \ee from which it follows, after multiplying by $\Gamma^\mu$ that such a background is Ricci flat.  The obvious solution of eq.(\ref{{eta}) is flat space. We will see that there also exist  non-trivial solutions to eq.(\ref{{eta}) beyond the trivial flat space.   Let us suppose that the spin connection satisfies the  ``self-duality'' condition \be  \omega_{{\alpha\beta\mu}=\frac{{1}{{2}\Psi_{{\a\b\g\d}  {{\omega^{{\g\d}}_{{\mu} \, , \label{{sd} \ee where $\Psi_{{\a\b\g\d}$ is defined in eq.(\ref{{p}) \footnote{{A relation of the form   $\omega_{{\alpha\beta\mu}= \lambda\Psi_{{\a\b\g\d}  {{\omega^{{\g\d}}_{{\mu}$ is consistent for $\lambda=1/2,-1/6$ as can be  verified by multiplying both sides  by $\Psi^{{\a\b\zeta\eta}$ and using eq.(\ref{{pp}). Here we will consider only the case $\lambda=1/2$.}. It is not then difficult to verify that the spinor $\eta^A$ in  eq.(\ref{{eta}) is necessarily right-handed and  \be \d\psi_\mu=  \partial_\mu\eta^A -\frac{{1}{{2}\omega_{{\a\b\mu}G^{{\a\b}\eta^A\, , %\Gamma^{{ab}\eta^A -\frac{{1}{{2}\omega_{{a8\mu} %\Gamma^{{a8}\eta^A=\partial_\mu\eta^A -\frac{{1}{{4}\omega_{{ab\mu} %\left(\Gamma^{{ab}\pm \Psi^{{abc}\Gamma^9\Gamma_{{8c}\right) \eta^A %\, ,  \ee where $G^{{\a\b}$ has been defined in eq.(\ref{{G}).   We see that  the gravitino shifts vanish if $\eta^A$ satisfies eq.(\ref{{Gh}) which means that the background preserves  $1/16$ of the original supersymmetries.  The Killing spinor is invariant under $SO(7)^+$ and thus,  spaces with connection satisfying eq.(\ref{{sd}) have holonomy in  $Spin(7)$.   Eq.(\ref{{sd}) is an eight-dimensional analog of the standard self-duality condition in four dimensions   where the quantity $\Psi_{{\a\b\g\d}$  replaces  by the totally antisymmetric symbol $\epsilon_{{abcd}$.  The corresponding solutions are the four-dimensional gravitational instantons. In this respective, we will also call eight-dimensional  manifolds with connection satisfying   eq.(\ref{{sd}) in the Euclidean regime gravitational instantons.  As we have already pointed out, the holonomy group  of such manifolds is in $Spin(7)$. Alternatively, this can be seen as follows. Let us recall that a manifold is of $Spin(7)$ holonomy  if  and only if the  Cayley four-form \cite{{sal}  \be  \Psi&=&e^1\wedge e^2\wedge e^3\wedge e^8+ e^5\wedge e^1\wedge e^6\wedge e^8+ e^6\wedge e^2\wedge e^4\wedge e^8+e^4\wedge e^3\wedge e^5\wedge e^8\nonumber \\ &&+e^4\wedge e^7\wedge e^1\wedge e^8+e^6\wedge e^7\wedge e^3\wedge e^8 +e^5\wedge e^7\wedge e^2\wedge e^8+e^4\wedge e^5\wedge e^6\wedge e^7\nonumber\\ &&+e^2\wedge e^3\wedge e^7\wedge e^4+e^1\wedge e^3\wedge e^5\wedge e^7 +e^1\wedge e^3\wedge e^5\wedge e^7+e^1\wedge e^2\wedge e^7\wedge e^6  \nonumber \\ &&+e^2\wedge e^3\wedge e^5\wedge e^6 +e^1\wedge e^2\wedge e^4\wedge e^5 +e^1\wedge e^3\wedge e^4\wedge e^6\, , \label{{c} \ee where $e^\a,~ \a=1,\ldots,8$ is an orthonormal frame (the metric is  $\sum_ie^i\otimes e^i$ in this frame), is torsion free, i.e., if it is closed  \be d\Psi=0\, .  \ee In this case, the manifold is Ricci flat. The Cayley form  $\Psi$ is self-dual and,  in addition, it is invariant under $Spin(7)$. It is the singlet in the  decomposition of the ${{\bf 35}_+$ in  the non-standard embedding   of $SO(7)$  in $SO(8)$ given in  eq.(\ref{{8+})  according to which   \be {{\bf 35}_v={{\bf 35}\, , ~~~  {{\bf 35}_+={{\bf 1} + {{\bf 7}+{{\bf 27}\, ,  ~~~ {{\bf 35}_-={{\bf 35}\, . \ee  In order to prove now  that manifolds with connection that satisfies eq.(\ref{{sd}) are of $Spin(7)$ holonomy, let us observe that the Cayley four-form $\Psi$  can actually be written as  \be \Psi=\frac{{1}{{4!}\Psi_{{\a\b\g\d}e^\a\wedge e^\b\wedge e^\g\wedge e^\d\, .  \label{{omega} \ee  It is not difficult then to verify by using eq.(\ref{{fund}) and the structure  equations  $$de^\a+{{\omega^\a}_\b e^\b=0\, , ~~~~~~{{\omega^\a}_\b= {{\omega^\a}_{{\b\mu} dx^\mu\, , $$  that, if the spin connection satisfies  eq.(\ref{{sd}), the Cayley form $\Psi$ is indeed closed. Thus, manifolds  whose connection satisfies the ``self-duality'' condition eq.(\ref{{sd})  are  Ricci flat $Spin(7)$ manifolds.  \section{{Eight-dimensional gravitational instantons}  Our aim is to construct manifolds of $Spin(7)$ holonomy by solving  eq.(\ref{{sd}). By choosing  one direction, the eighth say,   eq.(\ref{{sd}) is written as  \be {{\omega^8}_r=-\frac{{1}{{2}\psi_{{rpq}\omega^{{pq}\, . \label{{seq} \ee The rest of the equations, namely, \be {{\omega^p}_q=\frac{{1}{{2}{{\psi^p}_{{qrs}\omega^{{rs}- {{\psi^p}_{{qr}\omega^{{r8}\, , \label{{seq2}  \ee are automatically satisfied if eq.(\ref{{seq}) holds. The self-duality  conditions are then explicitly written as  \be \omega_{{81}=-\left(\omega_{{23}+\omega_{{65}+\omega_{{47}\right)\, , && \omega_{{82}=-\left(\omega_{{31}+\omega_{{46}+\omega_{{57}\right)\, ,\nonumber\\  \omega_{{83}=-\left(\omega_{{12}+\omega_{{54}+\omega_{{67}\right)\, , && \omega_{{84}=-\left(\omega_{{62}+\omega_{{35}+\omega_{{71}\right)\, ,\nonumber\\ \omega_{{85}=-\left(\omega_{{16}+\omega_{{43}+\omega_{{72}\right)\, , && \omega_{{86}=-\left(\omega_{{51}+\omega_{{24}+\omega_{{73}\right)\, ,\nonumber\\ \omega_{{87}=-\left(\omega_{{14}+\omega_{{36}+\omega_{{25}\right)\, ,  &&    \label{{expli} \ee The obvious solutions to the above equations  are spaces of the form $M_1\times M_2$ where $M_1,M_2$ are four-dimensional manifolds of self-dual or antiself-dual connections.  However, other solutions exist as well. Here we will present a space  with  metric \be ds^2&=&R^2(dx_1^2+dx_2^2)+V^2\left(dx_3+2Adx_8\right)^2+U^2dx_8^2 +\label{{metric}\\ && E^2\left(dx_4+2Bdx_5\right)^2+ G^2dx_5^2+H^2dx_6^2+F^2\left(dx_7+2Cdx_6\right)^2\, , \nonumber \ee where $R,V,A,U,E,B,G,F,C,H$ are functions of $x_1,x_2$ only and they will be  specified by solving eqs.(\ref{{expli}). We may introduce the  orthonormal basis \be &&e^1=Rdx_1\, ,~~e^2=Rdx_2\, ,~~e^3=V(dx_3+2Adx_8)\, ,~~ e^4=E(dx_4+2Bdx_5)\, , \nonumber \\ &&e^5=Gdx_5\,, ~~e^6=Hdx_6\,, ~~e^7=F(dx_7+2Cdx_6)\, ,~~ e^8=Udx_8\,, \label{{basis}  \ee in which the metric is $ds^2=\sum(e^i)^2$. In this base,   the non-zero components of the connection are \be &&\omega_{{12}=\frac{{1}{{R^2}\p_2Re^1-\frac{{1}{{R^2}\p_1Re^2\, , ~~ \omega_{{31}=\frac{{V}{{RU}\p_1Ae^8+\frac{{1}{{RV}\p_1Ve^3\,,\nonumber \\&& \omega_{{32}=\frac{{V}{{RU}\p_2Ae^8+\frac{{1}{{RV}\p_2Ve^3\,,~~ \omega_{{41}=\frac{{E}{{RG}\p_1Be^5+\frac{{1}{{RE}\p_1Ee^4\,,\nonumber \\&& \omega_{{42}=\frac{{E}{{RG}\p_2Be^5+\frac{{1}{{RE}\p_2Ee^4\,,~~ \omega_{{51}=\frac{{1}{{RG}\p_1Ge^5+\frac{{E}{{RG}\p_1Be^4\,,\nonumber \\&& \omega_{{52}=\frac{{1}{{RG}\p_2Ge^5+\frac{{E}{{RG}\p_2Be^4\,,~~  \omega_{{61}=\frac{{1}{{RH}\p_1He^6+\frac{{F}{{RH}\p_1CFe^7\,, \nonumber \\&& \omega_{{62}=\frac{{1}{{RH}\p_2He^6+\frac{{F}{{RH}\p_2CFe^7\,,~~ \omega_{{71}=\frac{{F}{{RH}\p_1Ce^6+\frac{{1}{{RF}\p_1Fe^7\,,\nonumber \\&& \omega_{{72}=\frac{{F}{{RH}\p_2Ce^6+\frac{{1}{{RF}\p_2Fe^7\,,~~ \omega_{{81}= \frac{{1}{{RU}\p_1Ue^8+\frac{{V}{{RU}\p_1Ae^3\,,\nonumber  \\&& \omega_{{82}=\frac{{1}{{RU}\p_2Ue^8+\frac{{V}{{RU}\p_2Ae^3\,,~~ \omega_{{83}=\frac{{V}{{RU}\p_1Ae^1+\frac{{V}{{RU}\p_2Ae^2\, , \nonumber \\&& \omega_{{54}=\frac{{E}{{RG}\p_1Be^1+\frac{{E}{{RG}\p_2Be^2\, ,~~  \omega_{{67}=\frac{{F}{{RH}\p_1Ce^1+\frac{{F}{{RH}\p_2Ce^2\, . \label{{conn} \ee where $\p_1=\p/\p x^1,\p_2=\p/\p x^2$.  %$$R=R(x_1,x_2),V=V(x_1,x_2),A=A(x_1,x_2), U=U(x_1,x_2), E=E(x_1,x_2), %B=B(x_1,x_2), G=G(x_1,x_2),F=F(x_1,x_2),C=C(x_1,x_2),H=H(x_1,x_2)$$. Substituting the above expressions in eq.(\ref{{expli}), we get  that  \be V=\frac{{1}{{U}\, , ~~E=\frac{{1}{{G}\, , ~~ F=\frac{{1}{{H}\, , ~~R=UHG\, . \ee In addition, the functions $2A,U^2,2B,G^2,2C,H^2$ satisfy  the Cauchy-Riemann equations \be &&\p_1U^2=2\p_2A\, , ~~\p_1G^2=2\p_2B\, , ~~\p_1G^2=2\p_2B\, , \nonumber \\&& \p_2U^2=-2\p_1A\, , ~~\p_2G^2=-2\p_1B\, ,~~ \p_2G^2=-2\p_1B\, ,\label{{CR} \ee and the metric is then  written as  \be ds^2&=&U^2G^2H^2(dx_1^2+dx_2^2)+U^{{-2}\left(dx_3+2Adx_8\right)^2+U^2dx_8^2+ \label{{metric1}\\ && G^{{-2}\left(dx_4+2Bdx_5\right)^2+ G^2dx_5^2+H^2dx_6^2+H^{{-2}\left(dx_7+2Cdx_6\right)^2\, . \nonumber \ee We may now introduce complex functions  \be \tau=2A+iU^2\, , ~~\sigma=2B+iG^2\, , ~~\rho=2C+iH^2\, , \label{{complex} \ee so that eqs.(\ref{{CR}) are satisfied for holomorphic $\tau=\tau_1+i\tau_2, \sigma=\sigma_1+i\sigma_2,\rho=\rho_1+i\rho_2$, \be \tau=\tau(z)\, ,~~\sigma=\sigma(z)\, , ~~\rho=\rho(z)\, , \ee where $z=x_1+ix_2$. Then, the metric turns out to be \be ds^2&=&\tau_2\sigma_2\rho_2|h(z)|^2dzd\bar{{z}+\frac{{1}{{\tau_2} |dx_3+\tau(z)dx_8|^2 +\nonumber \\ &&\frac{{1}{{\sigma_2} |dx_4+\sigma(z)dx_5|^2 +\frac{{1}{{\rho_2} |dx_7+\rho(z)dx_6|^2 \, , \label{{metrict} \ee where $h(z)$ is an arbitrary holomorphic function of $z$. From  eq.(\ref{{complex}) we see that $\tau,\sigma,\rho$ belong to the upper half  plane and thus each parametrize an $SL(2,{{\bf R})/U(1)$ coset space. In fact, the metric is  invariant under $SL(2,{{\bf R})\!\times\!SL(2,{{\bf R})\!\times\!SL(2,{{\bf R})$  which acts as  \be &&\tau\to \frac{{a\tau+b}{{c\tau+d}\,, ~~~ x_3\to -bx_8+ax_3\, , ~~~x_8\to dx_8-cx_3\, ~~~~ ad-bc=1\, , \nonumber \\ && \sigma\to \frac{{k\sigma+\ell}{{m\sigma+n}\,, ~~~ x_4\to-\ell x_5+kx_4\, ,~~~ x_5\to nx_5-mx_4\, ,~~~~ kn-\ell m=1\, , \nonumber   \\ && \rho\to \frac{{p\rho+r}{{s\rho+q}\,, ~~~ x_6\to qx_6-sx_7\, , ~~~ x_7\to-rx_6+px_7\,,~~~~ pq-rs=1\, .  \ee For periodic $x_3,\ldots,x_8$, the transverse space to the z-plane is a  product of three $T^2$. In that case, we may view $\tau,\sigma,\rho$ as the modulus of the tori if we restrict  them to the fundamental domain of $SL(2,{{\bf Z})$. Under the latter  they transform as  \be \tau\to \tau+1\, , ~~\tau\to-\frac{{1}{{\tau}\, , ~~~ \sigma \to \sigma +1\, , ~~\sigma\to-\frac{{1}{{\sigma}\, ,~~~ \rho\to \rho+1\, , ~~\rho\to-\frac{{1}{{\rho}\, . \ee   The holomorphic functions $\tau(z),\sigma(z),\rho(z)$ will have certain singularities in the z-plane which can be interpreted as magnetic  sources. In that case, as we go around these singularities we will have the  $SL(2,{{\bf Z})$ jumps $\tau\to \tau+1,\sigma\to \sigma+1,\rho\to \rho+1$ \cite{{CS},\cite{{K} so that,   if the singularities of $\tau,\sigma,\rho$ are at  $z_i^\tau,z_i^\sigma,z_i^\rho$, respectively, \be \tau\sim -\frac{{i}{{2\pi}\log (z-z_i^\tau)\, ,~~ \sigma\sim -\frac{{i}{{2\pi}\log (z-z_i^\sigma)\, , ~~\rho\sim -\frac{{i}{{2\pi}\log (z-z_i^\rho)\,. \ee The metric (\ref{{metrict}) is $SL(2,{{\bf Z})$ invariant if $h(z)$ in eq.(\ref{{metrict}) has certain modularity properties  without zeroes in the fundamental domains. This uniquely specifies  \be h(z)=\eta(\tau)^2\eta(\sigma)^2\eta(\rho)^2\, , \label{{h} %\prod_{{i,j,k=1}^{{N_\tau,N_\sigma,N_\rho} %\prod_{{j=1}^{{N_\sigma}\, ,   \ee up to a modular invariant holomorphic function,  where $$\eta(\tau)=q^{{1/24}\prod_n(1-q^n)\, , $$ is the Dedekind's function ($q=exp(2\pi i\tau)$).  However, since $q\sim  (z-z_i)$, we have that  $$\eta(\tau)^2\eta(\sigma)^2\eta(\rho)^2\sim \left((z-z_i^\tau)(z-z_j^\sigma)(z-z_k^\rho)\right)^{{1/12}$$ and thus instead of eq.(\ref{{h}) we should take   \be h(z)=\eta(\tau)^2\eta(\sigma)^2\eta(\rho)^2 \prod_{{i,j,k=1}^{{N_\tau,N_\sigma,N_\rho} %\prod_{{k=1}^{{N_\rho} \left(z-z_i^\tau\right)^{{-1/12}\left(z-z_j^\sigma\right)^{{-1/12} \left(z-z_k^\rho\right)^{{-1/12}\,, \ee where $N_\tau,N_\sigma,N_\rho$ are the number of singularities of  $\tau,\sigma,\rho$, respectively. As usual, we must have  $N_\tau+N_\sigma+N_\rho=12$  in order that no conical singularities appear. In this case, the z-plane is  asymptotically a cylinder and if $N_\tau+N_\sigma+N_\rho=24$, we have  a sphere \cite{{CS}.   \section{{Comments} We have discussed here eight-dimensional self-dual spaces. As we have seen,  such spaces have holonomy in $Spin(7)$. In a sense, they generalize  the four-dimensional self-dual manifolds which are of $SU(2)$ holonomy.  We have presented a space with a self-dual connection and an  elliptically-fibered structure.  The base is a sphere and the fibres are three tori. The tori degenerate at a total number of twenty-four  points in the same way as in  the stringy cosmic string solution \cite{{CS},\cite{{K}.   It should be noted that a self-duality condition can also be written down in  seven dimensions as \be \omega_{{ab}=\lambda\psi_{{abcd}\omega^{{cd}\, , \label{{g2} \ee where $\psi_{{abcd}$ have been defined in eq.(\ref{{psi}) and  $\lambda=1/2,-1/4$.  In this case,  spaces with connection satisfying the  above equation are of holonomy in $G_2$. This can be seen by recalling that for the $G_2$ case, the Cayley four-form is replaced by a three  form $\Phi$ and its dual $\ast\Phi$ which turn out to be \be \Phi=\frac{{1}{{3!}\psi_{{abc}e^a\wedge e^b\wedge e^c\, , ~~ \ast \Phi =\frac{{1}{{4!}\psi_{{abcd} e^a\wedge e^b\wedge e^c\wedge e^d\, . \ee The condition of $G_2$ holonomy then reduces to the closure of $\Phi,\ast\Phi$. Indeed, it is not difficult to prove that for spaces with connection  satisfying eq.(\ref{{g2}), $\Phi$ and $\ast\Phi$ are closed.    Spaces of $G_2$ holonomy are  relevant for M-theory compactifications.   They give rise to N=1 in four-dimensions and they are the counterparts of  CY compactifications of string-theory. As have been pointed out in  \cite{{J2}, $G_2$ holonomy spaces can be constructed from CY threefolds   as the quotient $(CY_3\times S^1)/\pi$ where $\pi$ acts as a complex involution on $CY_3$  and as $x\to-x$ on $S^1$ and then appropriately resolving the singularities. Non-compact examples have been constructed in  \cite{{B}.   An interesting open problem, mentioned also in \cite{{J7}, is the construction  of eight-dimensional ALE spaces. For example, there should exists a    higher-dimensional analog  of the Eguchi-Hanson solution  which is the simplest case of  the four-dimensional ALE spaces with $SU(2)$ holonomy. Such manifolds,  as well as ALE spaces of $SU(n)$ holonomy,  have extensively been studied. However, nothing is actually  known about  ALE spaces of $Spin(7)$ of $G_2$ holonomy. We believe, that there should exist solutions to the self-duality condition eq.(\ref{{sd}) which will correspond to such spaces.        %\noindent %{{\bf{{Acknowledgement}}  %\vspace{{.3cm}   %\newpage  %\begin{{flushleft} %{{\large\bf Appendix}\end{{flushleft} %\renewcommand{{\theequation}{{A.\arabic{{equation}} %\renewcommand{{\thesection}{{B.} %\setcounter{{equation}{{0}  \begin{{thebibliography}{{99} \bibitem{{H} S.W.

This method is applied to  an uniform system of relativistic spin-$1/2$ fermion field coupled, through a Yukawa term, to a scalar field in 3+1 dimensions, the so-called quantum scalar plasma model.  The renormalization for the resulting Gaussian mean-field equations, both static and dynamical, are examined and initial conditions discussed.

Introduction} \end{{center}  \indent The self-consistent mean-field method remains being one of the few analytical tools available to investigate a variety of problems in quantum field theory which cannot be handled in  perturbative theory. These include static problems in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking \cite{{St85} as well as time-dependent problems involving the dynamics of the inflation-driving scalar field in the early Universe \cite{{Bo97} and the dynamics of relaxation process in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion experiments \cite{{CBL97}.  In its most used form the approximation is implemented, in the case of boson fields, through of a time-dependent or independent  variational principle using a Gaussian trial wavefunction in the Schroedinger picture \cite{{EPJ88}.  However, systematic corrections to this approximation are still an open problem. Furthermore, for the case of fermion fields, the trial wavefunction is not straightforward to take in a Gaussian form \cite{{KSY90}.  \indent On the other hand, the mean-field description of systems of interest can be  obtained from the Heisenberg equation % \be \label{{1a} i \langle \dot{{\cal O}\rangle=Tr [{{\cal O},H] {{\cal F}_{{0}\;\;, \ee  \noindent where ${{\cal O}$ is a one-body operator and $H$ is the Hamiltonian of the system. This can be kept under direct control when one takes a gaussian-like density. In a  formulation appropriate for the many-body theory we have  % \be \label{{1b} {{\cal F}_{{0} =\frac{{\exp \left[\sum_{{(i,j)} A_{{i,j}\eta^{{\dag}_{{i}\eta_{{j}+ B_{{i,j}\eta^{{\dag}_{{i}\eta^{{\dag}_{{j}+ C_{{i,j}\eta_{{i}\eta_{{j}\right]} {{Tr \left\{{\exp \left[\sum_{{(i,j)} A_{{i,j}\eta^{{\dag}_{{i}\eta_{{j}+ B_{{i,j}\eta^{{\dag}_{{i}\eta^{{\dag}_{{j}+ C_{{i,j}\eta_{{i}\eta_{{j}\right]\right\}} \;\;. \ee   \noindent In (\ref{{1b}) the $\eta^{{\dag}_{{i}$ ($\eta_{{i}$) are boson or fermion creation (annhihilation) operators of a particle in orbital $i$ and  ${{\cal F}_{{0}$ can be, of course, rewritten in a diagonal form when one uses the Bogoliubov quasiparticle operators (cf. Eqs.(\ref{{4a}) and (\ref{{5a})).  It is not difficult to see that this scheme corresponds to the usual gaussian variational approximation in the functional Schroedinger picture.  There are, however, some important differences.  For instance, the usual technique of nonrelativistic many-fermion problem  can be readily extended to the Dirac field theory \cite{{CS81}. Thus, instead of using anticommuting Grassmann variables to write Gaussian wavefunctional \cite{{KSY90}, we describe the pairing correlations by a suitable  Bogoliubov unitary transformation.  Furthermore, this could be the starting point for the further approximation scheme beyond the Gaussian \cite{{NTP83}. In recent publications \cite{{LTP92}, we have applied this scheme to the $\phi^4$ theory and Chiral Gross-Neveu Model (hereafter referred to as I,II).   \indent The main point of this paper is to apply this method within the context of interacting fermion-boson models. As a first step towards this end, Takano Natti and de Toledo Piza \cite{{TNTP97} have obtained relevant dynamics for the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, a well known model in quantum optics \cite{{JC63}.  This can be seen as $0+1$ dimensional quantum field theory known as relativistic scalar plasma \cite{{Ka67}.  Exact numerical results have been useful in this case to assess the quality of various approximation schemes.  In particular, we have shown that the method described here is a good approximation whenever a moving Gaussian has enough freedom to mimic the complicated evolution of the exact wave function.   In this paper, we report an aplication of the same technique to describe the real-time evolution for a fermion field interacting with scalar boson in $3+1$ dimensions. An outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we extend the discussions of I and II to a system countaing interacting boson and fermion fields.   %Since part of the technical details was already reported there, we %shall rely on several results of these previous works.  Sec. III will illustre this scheme in the simplest context of scalar plasma model. In Sec. IV we discuss the self-consistent renormalization for the resulting equations in the equilibrium situation. The renormalization of the time-dependent equations is then considered in Sec V and finite initial conditions discussed.  \medskip  \renewcommand{{\theequation}{{\arabic{{equation}} %\setcounter{{equation}{{0} \begin{{center} {{\bf II. Kinetic of Interacting Fermion-Scalar Systems} \end{{center} \smallskip  \indent{{The} present discussion for the real-time evolution of theories containing both scalar and fermion fields basically follows the earlier works in the context of $\phi^4$ and Chiral-Gross-Neveu models.    The basic idea of our approach is to focus on the time evolution of the expectation values of linear, $\phi(x)$, and bilinear field operators such as $\phi(x)\phi(x)$ , $\bar\psi(x)\psi(x)$ , $\psi(x)\psi(x)$ and etc, referred to as Gaussian observables.   Many technical details of the method can be found in I and II, and we restrict ourselves here to a few key steps of the derivation of equations of motion for the present case.    \indent{{Let} us consider first the bosonic sector of the system. The Heisenberg field operators $\phi(x)$ and $\Pi(x)$ are expanded as  % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{3} \phi({{\bf x},t) &=&\sum_{{\bf p} \frac{{1}{{(2Vp_{{0})^{{1/2}} \left[b_{{\bf p}(t)e^{{i{{\bf p}.{{\bf x}}+b_{{\bf p}^{{\dag}(t) e^{{-i{{\bf p}.{{\bf x}}\right]\;\;\nonumber\\ \\ \Pi({{\bf x},t) &=&i\sum_{{\bf p} \left( \frac{{Vp_{{0}}{{2}\right)^{{1/2} \left[b_{{\bf p}^{{\dag}(t)e^{{-i{{\bf p}.{{\bf x}} -b_{{\bf p}(t)e^{{i{{\bf p}.{{\bf x}}\right]\;\;,\nonumber \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent where $b_{{\bf p}^{{\dag}(t)$ and $b_{{\bf p}(t)$ are the usual boson creation and annihilation operators satisfying the standard commutation relations at equal times % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{4} [b_{{\bf p}(t),b_{{\bf p^{{\prime}}^ {{\dag}(t^{{\prime})]_{{t=t^{{\prime}}= \delta_{{{{\bf p},{{\bf p^{{\prime}}}\;\;, \;\;[b_{{\bf p}^{{\dag}(t),b_{{\bf p^{{\prime}}^{{\dag} (t^{{\prime})]_{{t=t^{{\prime}}=[b_{{\bf p}(t), b_{{\bf p^{{\prime}}(t^{{\prime})]_{{t=t^{{\prime}}=0\;\;.   \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent  In Eq.(\ref{{3}) $V$ is the volume of the periodicity box,  \[ (p_{{0})^{{2}={{\bf p}^2+\Omega^{{2}\;\;\;\; {{\rm and}\;\;\;\; px=p_{{0}t-{{\bf p}.{{\bf x} \; , \] \noindent where $\Omega$ is the mass parameter and will be fixed later.   \indent{{In} order to deal with condensate and pairing dynamics of the scalar field we follow Sec. II of I and define a unitary Bogoliubov transformation as % \begin{{equation} \label{{4a} \left[ \begin{{array}{{c} \beta_{{\bf p}\\         \\ \beta_{{-\bf p}^{{\dag} \end{{array} \right]=\left[ \begin{{array}{{cc} \cosh \kappa_{{\rm p}-i\frac{{\eta_{{\rm p}}{{2}  &   \sinh \kappa_{{\rm p}-i\frac{{\eta_{{\rm p}}{{2}\\ \\ \sinh \kappa_{{\rm p}+i\frac{{\eta_{{\rm p}}{{2} &   \cosh \kappa_{{\rm p}+i\frac{{\eta_{{\rm p}}{{2} \end{{array} \right] \left[ \begin{{array}{{c} d_{{\bf p}  \\       \\ d_{{-\bf p}^{{\dag} \end{{array} \right]\;\;, \end{{equation}  \noindent where $d_{{\bf p}$ is the shifted boson operator % \begin{{equation} \label{{4b} d_{{\bf p}(t)\equiv b_{{\bf p}(t)- B(t)\delta_{{{{\bf p},0}\;\;\;\;{{\mbox{{with}}\;\;\;\;  B_{{\bf p}(t) \equiv\langle b_{{\bf p}(t) \rangle = Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}}\;\left[b_{{\bf p}(t){{\cal F_0}\right]\;\;. \end{{equation}  \noindent{{Here} and in what follows the symbol $Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}}$ denotes a trace over both bosonic and fermionic variables. Partial traces over bosonic or fermionic variables will be written as  $Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny B}}$ and $Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny F}}$ respectively.  The Bogoliubov coefficients are determined from the secular problem given in (2.8)-(2.10) of I to yield $\langle\beta_{{\bf p}\beta_{{-\bf p}\rangle=0$.  The resulting eigenvalues,  $\nu_{{\bf p}=\langle\beta^{{\dag}_{{\bf p}\beta_{{\bf p}\rangle$,  are quasi-particle occupation numbers.  \indent For the fermion field, we follow the discussion of II and decompose the field operators in Fourier components, % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{5} \psi({{\bf x},t)&=&\sum_{{{{\bf k},s}\left(\frac{{M}{{k_{{0}}\right)^{{1/2}\frac{{1}{{\sqrt V} \left[u_{{1}({{\bf k},s)a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(1)}(t)e^{{i {{\bf k}.{{\bf x}} +u_{{2}({{\bf k},s){{a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(2)}}^{{\dag}(t) e^{{-i {{\bf k}.{{\bf x}}\right]\;\; \nonumber\\ \\ \bar\psi({{\bf x},t)&=&\sum_{{{{\bf k},s}\left(\frac{{M}{{k_{{0}}\right)^{{1/2}\frac{{1}{{\sqrt V}\left[\bar u_{{1}({{\bf k},s){{a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(1)}}^{{\dag}(t)e^{{-i {{\bf k}.{{\bf x}}+ \bar u_{{2}({{\bf k},s)a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(2)}(t) e^{{i {{\bf k}.{{\bf x}}\right]\;\;, \nonumber \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent where   ${{a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(1)}}^{{\dag}(t)$ and $a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(1)}(t)$ [${{a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(2)}}^{{\dag}(t)$ and $a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(2)}(t)$] are fermion creation and annihilation operators associated with positive [negative]-energy solutions $u_{{1}({{\bf k},s)$ [$u_{{2}({{\bf k},s)$] and satisfy the anticommutation rules % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{6} \{{{{a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}}^{{\dag}(t),a_{{{{\bf k^{{\prime}},s^{{\prime}}^{{(\lambda^{{\prime})} (t^{{\prime})\}_{{t=t^{{\prime}}&=&\delta_{{{{\bf k},{{\bf k^{{\prime}}}\delta_{{s,s^{{\prime}}\delta_{{\lambda,\lambda^{{\prime}} \;\;\;\;{{\rm for}\;\;\;\lambda,\lambda'=1,2\;\; \nonumber\\ \\ \{{{{a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}}^{{\dag}(t),{{a_{{{{\bf k^{{\prime}},s^{{\prime}}^{{(\lambda^{{\prime})}}^{{\dag} (t^{{\prime})\}_{{t=t^{{\prime}}&=&\{{a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}(t), a_{{{{\bf k^{{\prime}},s^{{\prime}}^{{(\lambda^{{\prime})} (t^{{\prime})\}_{{t=t^{{\prime}}=0\;\;.  \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} \vskip 0.2cm  \noindent  In Eq.(\ref{{5}) the spinors are normalized to $k_{{0}/M$ and % \be \label{{6a} (k_{{0})^{{2}={{\bf k}^{{2}+M^{{2}\;\;\;\; {{\rm and}\;\;\;\; kx=k_{{0}t-{{\bf k}.{{\bf x} \; \ee  \noindent where $M$ is a mass parameter for the fermions.   \indent Adapting Eqs. (3)-(11) and (30) of II to the present case of 3+1 dimensional field we can write the  Bogoliubov quasi-particle operators as  % \begin{{equation} \label{{5a} \left[\! \begin{{array}{{c}       \alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(1)}    \\                    \\       \alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(2)}    \\                    \\ {{\alpha_{{-{{\bf k},{{\bar s}}^{{(1)}}^{{\dag}\\                    \\ {{\alpha_{{-{{\bf k},{{\bar s}}^{{(2)}}^{{\dag} \end{{array} \!\right]\!=\!\left[\! \begin{{array}{{cccc} \cos\varphi_{{\bf{{k}} &      0       &      0       &            e^{{-i\gamma_{{\bf{{k}}}\sin\varphi_{{\bf{{k}} \\           &              &              &              \\     0       & \cos\varphi_{{\bf{{k}} & -e^{{-i\gamma_{{\bf{{k}}} \sin\varphi_{{\bf{{k}} &     0        \\            &              &              &              \\    0       & e^{{i\gamma_{{\bf{{k}}}\sin\varphi_{{\bf{{k}}           &\cos\varphi_{{\bf{{k}} &     0        \\            &              &              &              \\ -e^{{i\gamma_{{\bf{{k}}}\sin\varphi_{{\bf{{k}} &      0       &      0           & \cos\varphi_{{\bf{{k}}  \end{{array} \!\right]\left[ \!\begin{{array}{{c}     a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(1)}    \\                          \\      a_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(2)}    \\                          \\ {{a_{{-{{\bf k},{{\bar s}}^{{(1)}}^{{\dag}\\                          \\ {{a_{{-{{\bf k},{{\bar s}}^{{(2)}}^{{\dag} \end{{array} \!\right] \end{{equation}  \noindent and require  $\langle \alpha_{{-{{\bf k},\bar s}^{{(\lambda^{{\prime})} \alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}\rangle = 0$ in order to determine this unitary transformation.  The quasi-fermion occupation number will be given by $\nu^{{(\lambda)}_{{{{\bf k},s}  =\langle{{\alpha^{{(\lambda)}_{{{{\bf k},s}}^{{\dag}\alpha^{{(\lambda)}_{{{{\bf k},s}\rangle$.   In (\ref{{5a}) we used  $|\bar{{s}\rangle=(-)^{{1/2-s}|-s\rangle$ to write the spin labels.   \indent The next step is to obtain the equations of motion for the condensate, $\langle\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\Pi\rangle$, and for the Bogoliubov parameters given in (\ref{{4a})-(\ref{{4b}) and (\ref{{5a}).  This proceeds by using the Heisenberg equation of motion (\ref{{1a}), where $\cal O$ are performed by linear or bilinear combinations of creation and annihilation parts of the field operators [see (2.17) of I and (5) of II for details]. For the bosonic variables we have % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10} i \langle\dot\phi\rangle&=&Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}}[\phi,H]{{\cal   F}_{{0}\\\nonumber\\  \label{{10a} i \langle\dot\Pi\rangle&=&Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}}[\Pi,H]{{\cal   F}_{{0} \\\nonumber\\ \label{{8} \dot \nu_{{\rm p} &=& Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}}[\beta_{{\bf p}^{{\dag}\beta_{{\bf p},H] {{\cal F}_{{0}\\ \nonumber\\  \label{{9} -i\dot\kappa_{{\rm p} -e^{{-\kappa_{{\rm p}}\left(\dot\eta_{{\rm p}+\dot\kappa_{{\rm p}\eta_{{\rm     p}\right)  %i(1+2\nu_{{\rm p})(\dot x_{{\rm p}y_{{\rm p}-x_{{\rm p}\dot y_{{\rm p}) &=& \frac{{Tr[\beta_{{\bf p}^{{\dag}\beta_{{-\bf p}^{{\dag},H] {{\cal F}_{{0}} {{1+2\nu_{{\rm p}} \;\;. \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent Analogously, the dynamical equations for fermionic variables read as %  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{11} \dot\nu^{{(\lambda)}_{{{{\bf k,},s} &=&Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}} \left([{{\alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}}^{{\dag}\alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}, H]{{\cal F}_{{0}\right) \\ \nonumber\\ \label{{12} \left[i\dot\varphi_{{\bf k}+\dot\gamma_{{\bf k}\sin\varphi_{{\bf k} \cos\varphi_{{\bf k}\right]e^{{-i\gamma_{{\bf k}} &=& \frac {{Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}}\left([\alpha_{{-{{\bf k},s}^{{(1)}\alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(2)}, H]{{\cal F}_{{0}\right)}{{1-\nu_{{{{\rm k},s}^{{(1)}-\nu_{{{{\rm k},s}^{{(2)}} \;\;. \end{{eqnarray}  \indent Our implementation of the Gaussian mean-field approximation consists in assuming a factorized form for the density matrix \cite{{TNTP97} % \be \label{{32c} {{\cal F}_{{0}(t) ={{\cal F}^{{\mbox{{\tiny B}}_{{0}{{\cal F}^{{\mbox{{\tiny F}}_{{0}\;\;. \ee  \noindent{{In} Eq.(\ref{{32c}) the subsystem densities  ${{\cal F}^{{\mbox{{\tiny B}}_{{0}$ and ${{\cal F}^{{\mbox{{\tiny F}}_{{0}$  are gaussian densities given in Eq.(\ref{{1b}), now rewritten in the diagonal forms using the Bogoliubov quasiboson and quasifermion operators, % \begin{{equation} \label{{32a} {{\cal F}^{{\mbox{{\tiny B}}_{{0}=\prod_{{\bf p}\frac {{1} {{1+\nu_{{\bf p}}\left(\frac {{\nu_{{\bf p}}{{1+\nu_{{\bf p}}\right) ^{{\beta_{{\bf p}^{{\dag}\beta_{{\bf p}}\;\;, \end{{equation} \vskip 0.2cm \begin{{equation} \label{{32b} {{\cal F}^{{\mbox{{\tiny F}}_{{0}=\prod_{{{{\bf k},s,\lambda} [\nu_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}{{\alpha^{{(\lambda)}_{{{{\bf k},s}}^{{\dag} \alpha^{{(\lambda)}_{{{{\bf k},s}+(1-\nu_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}) \alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}{{\alpha^{{(\lambda)}_{{{{\bf k},s}}^{{\dag}]\;\;. \end{{equation}   \noindent Substituting ${{\cal F}_{{0}$ into (\ref{{8}) and (\ref{{11}) one verifies immediately that the occupation numbers are constant, % \be \dot \nu_{{\rm p}  = Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}} [\beta_{{\bf p}^{{\dag}\beta_{{\bf p},H] {{\cal   F}_{{0}  =\dot\nu_{{{{\bf k},\lambda} =Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}} [{{\alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}}^{{\dag}\alpha_{{{{\bf k},s}^{{(\lambda)}, H]{{\cal F}_{{0} =0 \;\;. \ee  \noindent Thus, Eqs.(\ref{{10})-(\ref{{12}) form a set of self-consistent equations of  motion to the Gaussian variables.  Its implementation for a specific model consists essentially in taking the traces of appropriate commutators in the Fock space. The fact that occupancies are constant implies that the entropy function associated with ${{\cal F}_{{0}$, i.e., $S=-Tr_{{\mbox{{\tiny BF}}{{\cal F}_{{0}\log {{\cal F}_{{0}$, does not change in time. One recovers therefore the usual isoentropic character of the Gaussian approximation.    \indent A method to improve the mean-field approximation in field theory was discussed in I.  The approach follows the line of thinking of a time-dependent projection technique proposed some time ago by Willis and Picard \cite{{WP74} in the context of master equation for coupled systems  and extended later by Nemes and de Toledo Piza to study nonrelativistic many-fermion dynamics \cite{{NTP83}.  The method consists essentially in writting the correlation information of the {{\it full density} of the system in terms of a memory kernel acting on the uncorrelated density ${{\cal} F_{{0}$, with the help of a time-dependent projector (see Sec. III and Appendix A of I for details).  At this point, an systematic mean-field expansion for two-point correlations can be perfomed.  The lowest order reported in this work corresponds to the results of the usual Gaussian approximation.  The higher orders describe the dynamical correlation effects between the subsystems and are expressed through suitable memorial integrals added to the mean-field dynamical equations.  Thus, the resulting equations acquire the structure of kinetic equations, with the memory integrals performing as {{\it collisional} dynamics terms which eliminate the isoentropic constraint. This higher order approximation has been implemented for the case of $0+1$ dimensional field model \cite{{TNTP97} and will not be done in this paper.  \begin{{center} {{\bf III. Effective Dynamics of Relativistic Scalar Plasma} \end{{center}  \indent  The procedure discussed in the preceding section is quite general and can be, in principle, utilized for systems containing scalar and spin-1/2 particles.  This is not, however a straightforward task, since divergences appear in the equations require a discussion of the renormalizability of specific models of interest.   In Ref.\cite{{SHR86} properties and stability of possible vacuum states for  several fermion-scalar models utilizing the Gaussian-effective-potential (GEP) approach have been studied.    It is shown that in 3+1 dimensions the models seem doomed to instability and the GEP is bounded below only if the Yukawa coupling vanishes.   We have reached a similar conclusion in an early stage of this work.  \indent In order to give a well defined physical application, we shall adopt here the relativistic scalar plasma  model widely used within the  context of ultrahigh dense matter \cite{{AH84}.   This system consists of relativistic fermion gas interacting through a massive scalar meson only and corresponds to one of the simplest quantum-field theoretical models used to discuss the relativistic dense matter in the contexts of heavy-ion collisions and the high-density astrophysical system \cite{{Ka67}.  In this application, one considers the mean-field contributions, $\langle\phi\rangle$, are much larger than the flutuactions, $\langle\phi^2\rangle - \langle\phi\rangle ^2$. Therefore, the bosonic pairing is ignored and Bogoliubov transformation (\ref{{4a}) reduces to identity.  We shall show in the next sections that the resulting equations of interest in this case can be made finite by introducing appropriate counterterms.    \indent We now proceed to apply the technique discussed in Sec. II to the  scalar plasma model.  The dynamics is governed by the Hamiltonian (we use the notation: $\int_{{\bf x}\equiv\int d^{{3}x$) %  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{1} H&=&\int_{{\bf x} {{\cal H}\;,\nonumber\\ \\ {{\cal H}&=&-\bar\psi (i\vec\gamma.{{\vec\partial}-m)\psi- g\bar\psi\phi\psi+\frac{{1}{{8\pi} \left[ (4\pi \Pi)^2 + |\partial\phi|^2+ \mu^2\phi^2\right]+{{\cal H}_{{c}\;\;, \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} \vskip 0.5cm \noindent  where the parameters $m$ and $\mu$ are, respectively, the mass of fermion and scalar particles and $g$ is the coupling constant. The last term of this expression contains the counterterms necessary to remove the infinities occurring later \cite{{AH84},   \begin{{equation} \label {{27} 4\pi {{\cal H}_{{\mbox {{\tiny C}} = \frac{{A}{{1!}\phi +  \frac{{\delta \mu^{{2}} {{2!}\phi^{{2} + \frac{{C}{{3!}\phi^{{3} + \frac{{D}{{4!}\phi^{{4} \;\;, %\frac{{Z}{{2} (\partial\phi)^{{2}\;\;, \end{{equation} \vskip 0.5cm \noindent where the coeffcients $A$, $\delta \mu^{{2}$, $C$ and $D$ are infinite constants to be defined later.   \indent Introducing these ingredients into Eqs.(\ref{{10}), (\ref{{10a}) and (\ref{{12})  one easily obtains dynamical equation for the condensate % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{63} \langle\dot\phi\rangle &\!\!=&\!\!4\pi\langle\Pi\rangle\\\nonumber\\ \label{{121} \langle\dot\Pi\rangle &=&-\frac{{1}{{4\pi}\left[A+\frac{{C}{{2}G(\Omega)\right]    -\frac{{1}{{4\pi}\left[\mu^2+\delta\mu^2+\frac{{D}{{2}G(\Omega)\right] \langle\phi\rangle %\;\; \nonumber\\\nonumber\\ -\frac{{C}{{8\pi}\langle\phi\rangle^2-\frac{{D}{{24\pi}\langle\phi\rangle^3 \nonumber\\\nonumber\\ &\!\!-&\!\!g \sum_{{s} \int_{{\rm k} \frac{{1}{{k_{{0}}\left[M\cos 2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}}+ k\sin 2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}}\cos\gamma_{{{{\rm k}}\right] (1-\nu_{{ {{\rm k},s}^{{(1)}-\nu_{{{{\rm k},s}^{{(2)})\;\;, \end{{eqnarray}  \vspace{{0.3cm} \noindent where $k\equiv |{{\bf k}|$, and two real equations for the fermion pairing  % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{73} \dot \varphi_{{{{\rm k}}&=& \frac{{k}{{k_{{0}}(M-\bar{{m}) \sin\gamma_{{{{\rm k}}\\\nonumber\\ \label{{74} \sin2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}}\dot\gamma_{{{{\rm k}}&=& \frac{{2({{\bf k}^2+\bar{{m}M)}{{k_{{0}}\sin2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}}  +\frac{{2(M-\bar{{m})}{{k_{{0}}k  \cos2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}}\cos\gamma_{{{{\rm k}}\;\;. \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent  In (\ref{{121}) we have introduced the notation % \begin{{equation} \label{{87a} G(\Omega) = \int_{{\bf p} \frac{{1+2\nu_{{\rm p}}{{2\sqrt{{{{\bf p}^2+{{\Omega}^2}} =\frac{{1}{{8\pi^2}\left(\Lambda^2_{{\bf p}  +{{\Omega}^2\log\frac{{2\Lambda_{{\bf p}}{{\sqrt{{e}{{\Omega}}\right)  +\int_{{\bf p} \frac{{\nu_{{\rm p}}{{p_{{0}}  \;\; \end{{equation}  \noindent where $\Lambda_{{\bf p}$ is a momentum cutoff used in evaluating the integral. In (\ref{{73})-(\ref{{74})  $\bar m\equiv m-g\langle\phi\rangle$ stands for the effective fermion mass.  \indent Another physical quantity of interest is the energy density of the system,  % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{123a} \frac{{\langle H\rangle}{{V} &=& \frac{{1}{{V}Tr H{{\cal F}_{{0} \nonumber\\\nonumber\\ &=&-\sum_{{s}\int_{{\rm k} \left[\frac{{({{\bf k}^2+\bar m{{M})}{{k_{{0}} \cos 2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}}+\frac{{(\bar m-M)}{{k_{{0}}k \sin 2\varphi_{{\rm k}\cos\gamma_{{\rm k}\right](1-\nu_{{\rm k}^{{(1)}- \nu_{{\rm k}^{{(2)})\nonumber\\\nonumber\\ &&+\frac{{1}{{8\pi}\left[\langle\Pi\rangle^2+ \mu^2\langle\phi\rangle^2\right] +\frac{{1}{{4\pi}\left[A+\frac{{C}{{2}G(\Omega)\right] \langle\phi\rangle +\frac{{1}{{8\pi}\left[\delta\mu^2+\frac{{D}{{2}G(\Omega)\right]\langle\phi\rangle^2 \nonumber\\\nonumber\\ &&+\frac{{C}{{24\pi}\langle\phi\rangle^3 +\frac{{D}{{96\pi}\langle\phi\rangle^4 +\frac{{1}{{8\pi}\left[\mu^2+\delta\mu^2\right]G(\Omega) +\frac{{D}{{32\pi}G^2(\Omega)\;\;. \end{{eqnarray}   \noindent An important feature of this scheme is that the mean energy is conserved, a property which can be verified explicitly using the equations of motion (\ref{{63})-(\ref{{74}).  Notice also that the results above contain divergent integrals, so that the coefficients $A$, $\delta \mu^{{2}$, $C$ and $D$ have to be adjusted appropriately in order to give a well defined dynamics.  We shall focus on this point in the next sections.  \smallskip \begin{{center} {{\bf IV--Static Equations and Renormalization} \end{{center} \smallskip  This section considers Eqs. (\ref{{63})-(\ref{{74}) in the equilibrium situation.  We shall investigate the solution of these equations and study renormalization conditions.  Hence, we set  % \begin{{equation}  \dot\gamma_{{\rm k}=\dot\varphi_{{\rm k} =\langle\dot\phi\rangle= \langle\dot\Pi\rangle=0\;\;. \end{{equation}  \noindent Since our main goal here is to set up a Gaussian mean field approximation for interacting fermion-boson fields, we shall, for simplicity, not consider the matter contribution in the present calculation. This can be done in the case of Gaussian mean-field approximation by assuming an appropriate statistical distribution to the occupation numbers $\nu_{{\rm  p}$ and $\nu_{{\rm k,s}^{{(\lambda)}$ as initial conditions in (\ref{{8}) and (\ref{{11}).  Thus, for the rest of discussion we have vanishing occupancies,  $\nu_{{\rm  p}=\nu_{{\rm  k,s}^{{(\lambda)}=0$, and the sum in spin gives a numerical factor, $\sum_{{s}=2$.  With these assumptions, Eqs.(\ref{{63})-(\ref{{74}) become  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{81} &&\langle\Pi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}=0\;,\\\nonumber\\  \label{{82} &&\left[A+\frac{{C}{{2}G(\Omega)\right]+ \left[\mu^2+\delta\mu^2+\frac{{D}{{2}G(\Omega)\right] \langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}} +\frac{{C}{{2}\langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}^2 +\frac{{D}{{6}\langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}^3\nonumber\\\nonumber\\ &&+8\pi g\int_{{\rm k}\frac{{1}{{k_{{0}}\left( M\cos 2\varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}+k \sin 2\varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}\cos\gamma_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}} \right) = 0 \;, \\\nonumber\\ \label{{77} &&(M-\bar m) \sin\gamma_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}=0 \;,\\\nonumber\\  \label{{78} &&({{\bf k}^{{2}+\bar{{m}M)\sin 2\varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}} +(M-\bar m)\cos 2\varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}} \cos\gamma_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}} = 0 \;, \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent where $\bar{{m}$ is now the effective fermion mass calculated at $\langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}$.  Solutions of this set of equations correspond to a stationary points of the energy density, and include the ground state of the system in this approximation.   \smallskip  \centerline{{\bf A. Equilibrium conditions and mass parameters} \smallskip  \indent Considering equations (\ref{{77}) and (\ref{{78}) one sees that two situations have to be analysed.\\ \indent i)$\;\;\sin\gamma_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}=0\;\;$ \\ \indent Using this solution in Eq.(\ref{{78}) we have   % \be \label{{82d} \cos2\varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}} =\pm\frac{{({{\bf k}^2+\bar mM)}{{k_{{0} \bar k_{{0}}\;\;,\;\;\;\; \sin 2\varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}} =\mp\frac{{M-\bar m} {{k_{{0} \bar k_{{0}} \ee  \noindent where $\bar k_{{0}=\sqrt{{{{\bf k}^2+\bar m^2}$. Substituting this result into (\ref{{82}) one finds for this case the following gap equation  % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{89} \left[A+\frac{{C}{{2}G(\Omega)\right] +\left[\mu^2+\delta\mu^2+\frac{{D}{{2}G(\Omega)\right] \langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}} +\frac{{C}{{2}\langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}^2+\frac{{D}{{6} \langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}^3= \pm16\pi g \bar m G({{\bar m})\;, \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent  where $G({{\bar m})$ is the divergent integral defined in (\ref{{87a}) with $\nu_{{\rm p}=0$.  \indent ii)$\;\;M=\bar m$\\ \indent In this case $\gamma_{{\rm k}$ can have any value and (\ref{{78}) has as solution % \begin{{equation}  \label{{82a} \sin2\varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}=0\;\;,\;\;\; \cos2\varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}=\pm1\;\;\;  \end{{equation}  \noindent Comparing now (\ref{{82d}) with (\ref{{82a}) one notices immediately that the former includes the second solution as a particular case, where the mass parameter $M$ is defined here by the equilibrium condition and Bogoliubov  transformation (\ref{{5a}) reduces to an identity matrix.    \indent The above discussion shows that the equilibrium value $\langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}$ of the condensate, or the effective fermion mass $\bar m$ are independent of the initial choice of the mass paramete $M$.  In fact, the effects of pairing transformation will be such that the effective fermion mass is always given by the equilibrium value calculated with (\ref{{89}).    (See also (\ref{{110}) below for the  mean-field energy). Henceforth, we shall thus take $M=m$ without loss of generality.   \medskip \centerline{{\bf B. Counterterms} \medskip  \indent The arbitrary parameters $A$, $\delta\mu$, $C$ and $D$ can be fixed easily by adjusting the coefficients of $\langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}$ in both of sides of (\ref{{89}) to give a finite gap equation. Thus, taking account the $\pm$ signs in (\ref{{89}) we choose the following self-consistent renormalization prescription % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{94} D&=&\pm48\pi g^4 L(m)\;,\\ \label{{95} \delta\mu^2&=&\mp24\pi^2 g^4L(m)G(\mu)\mp16\pi g^2G(0)\pm24\pi m^2g^2 L(m)\;,\\ \label{{96} C&=&\mp48\pi mg^3L(m)\;,\\ \label{{97} A&=&\pm24\pi mg^3L(m)G(\mu)\pm16\pi mgG(m)\;, \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent where  \begin{{equation} \label{{98} L(m) \equiv \int_{{\bf k} \frac{{1}{{2{{\bf k}^2 ({{\bf k}^2+m^2)^{{1/2}} =\frac{{1}{{4\pi^2}\log\frac{{2\Lambda_{{\bf p}}{{m}\;. \end{{equation} \vskip 0.3cm \noindent  Furthermore, $\mu$ and $m$ are the mass scales for boson and fermion fields respectively.   \indent Substitution of these counterterms into (\ref{{89}) produce the appropriate cancelations which render the equation finite.  A combination of type $ L(m)[G(\mu)-G(\Omega)] $ comes from the first two terms.   Since $\Omega$ is an arbitrary expansion mass parameter, one can remove this divergence by setting $\Omega=\mu$.  The resulting finite gap equation is  \begin{{equation} \label{{103} \frac{{\pi}{{2}{{\mu}^2\langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}- g{{\bar m}^3\left[\ln\left(\frac{{\bar m}{{m}\right)+\frac{{1}{{2}\right]=0\;\;. \end{{equation} \vskip 0.3cm  \noindent The above equation together with (\ref{{77})-(\ref{{78})  determine the stationary points of the model in the Gaussian mean-field approximation.  \medskip  \centerline{{\bf C. Mean energy and stationary solutions}   \medskip  We examine next the energy density when it is stationary with respect to the fermion variables.  With the help of (\ref{{82d}), Eq.(\ref{{123a}) becomes   \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{110} \frac{{\langle H\rangle}{{V} \bigl( \varphi_{{\rm k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}, \gamma_{{\rm   k}|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}},\langle\phi\rangle\bigr)   &\!\!=&\!\! \mp\int_{{\rm k}G^{{-1}(\bar m)+ \frac{{1}{{4\pi}\left[A+\frac{{C}{{2}G(\mu)\right]  \langle\phi\rangle +\frac{{1}{{8\pi}\left[\mu^2+\delta\mu^2+ \frac{{D}{{2}G(\mu)\right] \langle\phi\rangle^2\nonumber\\\nonumber\\ &\!\!+&\!\!\frac{{C}{{24\pi}\langle\phi\rangle^3+ \frac{{D}{{96\pi}\langle\phi\rangle^4 \;\;. \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent Substituting next the counterterms (\ref{{94})-(\ref{{97}) into this result, we have the renormalized version of mean-field energy as function of mean-field value $\langle\phi\rangle$ or $\bar{{m}$   \begin{{equation} \label{{112} \frac{{\langle H\rangle}{{V}=\frac{{1}{{8\pi^2}\left[\frac{{\pi\mu^2}{{g^2} (m-{{\bar m})^2+{{\bar m}^4\ln\left(\frac{{\bar m}{{m}\right) +\frac{{({{\bar m}^4-m^4)}{{4}\right]\;\;, \end{{equation} \vskip 0.3cm  \noindent where we have added appropriate constant in order to get $\langle H\rangle(\langle\phi\rangle=0)=0$.  One can now discuss the possible solution of (\ref{{103}) by analysing the minima of (\ref{{112}).   \indent Let us define $x\equiv g\langle\phi\rangle|_{{\mbox{{\tiny eq}}/m$ and $E(x)\equiv (8\pi^2/m^4)\langle H\rangle/V$. Eqs. (\ref{{103}) and (\ref{{112}) can then be written respectively as  \begin{{equation} \label{{115} \frac{{\pi\mu^2}{{2g^2m^2}x-(1-x)^3\left[\ln(1-x)+\frac{{1}{{2}\right]=0\;\; \end{{equation}  \noindent and  \begin{{equation} \label{{113} E(x)=\frac{{\pi\mu^2}{{g^2m^2}x^2 +(1-x)^4 \left[\ln(1-x)+\frac{{1}{{4}\right]-\frac{{1}{{4}\;\;. \end{{equation} \vskip 0.3cm  \noindent The combination $\frac{{4g^2m^2}{{\pi\mu^2}$ has been used as an effective coupling constant in Ref.\cite{{AH84}.     \indent  The behavior of $E(x)$ is shown in Figs.(1)-(4) for several combination  of $\mu/m$ and $g^2$.   Notice first that this function has the domain at $0\le x \le 1$, which is the physical range for the fermion mass.  The point $x=0$ corresponds to $\langle\phi\rangle=0$ or $\bar m=m$ and $x=1$ is the case when the effective fermion mass $\bar m=0$.  Qualitatively, the results indicate that the system always presents a single {{\it minimum}.   Figs.(1)-(2) show $E(x)$ for several values of $g^2$ with $\mu/m$ fixed (see figure captions for numerical values of the parameters).  The positions of $x_{{min}$ indicate that the vacuum approaches $x=0$ when we decrease $g^2$.   In the limit of $g^2\rightarrow 0$, one gets $x_{{min}\rightarrow 0$, as shown in Fig.(3).  In this case, $m\approx\bar{{m}$ is the optimal fermion mass, as it must be in the free field theory.  On the other hand, Figs.(3)-(4) plot the function $E(x)$ keeping the value of the Yukawa coupling $g^2$ fixed, but with different values of the ratio $\mu/m$.  Comparing these two curves one sees $x_{{min}\rightarrow0$ when $\mu/m\rightarrow\infty$.  In other words, when the meson mass is large, the force range is small, as usual in the Yukawa theory.  In the limit of infinity $\mu$, the fermion particles of the system cannot interact.  It can be seen also from the AH's formula, where $m/\mu$ plays roles of effective coupling constant.  The above discussions suggest that the field has always a stable vacuum.  This means that there is a finite range around the minimum where the dynamics of the system is well defined.  In the next section, we shall therefore discuss renormalization conditions for the time-dependent equations.   \smallskip \begin{{center} {{\bf V. Renormalization and Initial Conditions for             the Time-Dependent Equations} \end{{center} \smallskip  The last section has discussed the problem of renormalization for the vacuum sector of the relativistic scalar plasma model in the Gaussian mean-field approximation.  We have shown that the physical quantities can be made finite with the counterterms introduced in (\ref{{27}) and (\ref{{94})-(\ref{{97}).  Here we shall consider an off-equilibrium situation and study renormalizability for the Gaussian equations of motion for this model.    (See, e.g., Refs.\cite{{PS87,KL95} for the issue of renormalization of time-dependent equations in $\phi^4$ field theory)   \medskip \centerline{{\bf A.  Equations of Motion and Initial State} \medskip  \indent In order to pose the problem more clearly, let us begin by rewriting Eq.(\ref{{121}), with the help of (\ref{{94})-(\ref{{97}), as  % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{61a} \langle\ddot\phi\rangle =-\mu^2\langle\phi\rangle-8\pi g {{\cal F}(t) \;\;. \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent where % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{62a} {{\cal F}(t)=\int_{{\rm k}{{\cal F}_{{\rm k}(t) =\int_{{\rm k}\left[\frac{{m}{{k_{{0}}\cos 2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}} +\frac{{k}{{k_{{0}}\sin 2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}}\cos\gamma_{{{{\rm k}}+\frac{{\bar m(t)}{{k}-\frac{{\bar m^3(t)}{{2k^2k_{{0}}\right]\;\;. \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent Notice that the integral is divergent unless ${{\cal F}_{{\rm k}$ decreases faster than $k^{{-3}$. For simplicity, we shall ignore here the possibilities of fractional powers, logarithmic or oscillatory behavior and take the convergence condition for the integral to be   % \be \label{{63f} \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty} {{\cal F}_{{\rm k}  ={{\cal O}\left( \frac{{1}{{k^{{4}} \right)\;\;. \ee  \noindent Thus, the allowed domains for the dynamical variables in momentum space suffer strong constraints, and our investigation of renormalizability of the  equations of motion consists in analysing the large momentum behavior of  ${{\cal F}_{{\rm k}$ from this point of view. In order to satisfy (\ref{{63f}) at all times the pairing variables $\varphi_{{\rm k}$ and $\gamma_{{\rm k}$ must have their time evolution restricted. These restrictions are analysed better by making the variable changes    % \be \label{{626} k^2_0\cos 2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}} =-mR_{{\rm k}-k\sqrt{{k^2_0-R^2_{{\rm k}}\\\nonumber\\ \ee  \noindent or, equivalently, % \be \label{{627} k^2_0\sin 2\varphi_{{{{\rm k}} =-kR_{{\rm k}+m\sqrt{{k^2_0-R^2_{{\rm k}}\;\;, \ee  \noindent and % \be \label{{628} \cos\gamma_{{\rm k} = 1-W_{{\rm k} \;\;.   \ee  \noindent In terms of these new variables we have  %  \be \label{{628a} {{\cal F}(t) \;=\;\int_{{\rm k}{{\cal F}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}+\int_{{\rm k}{{\cal F}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k}\;\;, \ee  \noindent where % \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{628b} {{\cal F}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}&=&-\frac{{R_{{\rm k}}{{k_0} +\frac{{\bar m(t)}{{k}-\frac{{\bar m^3(t)}{{2k^2k_{{0}} \;\;,\\\nonumber\\ \label{{628c} {{\cal F}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k}&=&\frac{{k}{{k^3_0}W_{{\rm k} \left(-kR_{{\rm k}+m\sqrt{{k^2_0-R^2_{{\rm k}}\right) \;\;. \end{{eqnarray}  \noindent We see in ${{\cal F}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}$ that the leading term of  $R_{{\rm k\rightarrow \infty }$ must be $\bar m$ in order to cancel the quadratic divergence. Thus, we define % \be \label{{629} \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty}R_{{\rm k} = \bar m + S_{{\rm k} \; \ee  \noindent valid for large $k$. Using this in (\ref{{628b}) one gets  % \bea \label{{630a} \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty} {{\cal F}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k} &=&\frac{{\bar m m^2}{{k k_{{0} ( k+k_{{0} )} -\frac{{\bar m^3}{{2k^2k_0} -\frac{{S_{{\rm k} }{{k_{{0}}\nonumber\\ &=&\frac{{1}{{k_0} \Bigl[\frac{{\bar m(m^2-\bar m^2)}{{ k ( k+k_0 ) }-S_{{\rm k}\Bigr] + {{\cal O}\left( \frac{{1}{{k^5} \right) \;\;. \eea  \noindent There is still a logarithmic divergence left. To keep this under control  we must have % \be \label{{631} \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty} S_{{\rm k} = \frac{{\bar m(m^2-\bar m^2)}{{ k ( k+k_0 ) } \ee   \noindent in order to get finite $\int_{{\rm k}{{\cal F}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}$.  \indent  We examine next the convergence condition for $\int_{{\rm k}{{\cal F}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k}$.  Using (\ref{{629}) and (\ref{{631}) in (\ref{{628c}) we find the asymptotic expression for ${{\cal F}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k}$ % \be \label{{632} \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty} {{\cal F}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k} \;=\;\left[\frac{{k^3(\bar{{m}^2-m^2)}{{k^3_0(k\bar{{m}+k_0m)} %-\frac{{m^4}{{k_0(k\bar{{m}+k_0m)} +{{\cal O}\left( \frac{{1}{{k^3} \right) \right] W_{{\rm k} \;\;. %\hspace{{1.0cm} ( {{\bf k}\rightarrow \infty ) \;. \ee  \noindent This will constrain the large-$k$ behavior of $W_{{\rm k}$ to be % \be \label{{633} \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty} W_{{\rm k} ={{\cal O}\left( \frac{{1}{{k^{{3}} \right) \;\;, \ee  \noindent in order to satisfy (\ref{{63f}).  \indent The asymptotic conditions (\ref{{629}), (\ref{{631}) and (\ref{{633}) restrict the dynamics of the Gaussian variables in the moment space.  Whenever the Fourier spectrum ${{\cal F}_{{\rm k}$ has such properties Eqs.(\ref{{61a})-(\ref{{62a}) are well defined, and one ought  to use these also as a criterion for choosing initial conditions.   Since, however, we are dealing with a time dependent problem, the question we want to address to ourselves is whether the nonlinear evolution will distort the asymptotic behavior built into the initial  state. From the energy viewpoint, we argue that, if the relations (\ref{{629}), (\ref{{631}) and (\ref{{633}) result a finite energy density, its conservation will enforce these relations at all time.  In fact, as we shall show below, the asymptotic behavior obtained in (\ref{{629}), (\ref{{631}) and (\ref{{633}) are suffcient to make (\ref{{123a}) finite.   \medskip \centerline{{\bf B. Asymptotic Conditions and Energy Density} \medskip  \indent   In terms of new variables $R_{{\rm k}$ and $W_{{\rm k}$ the energy density (\ref{{123a}) can be rewritten as % \be \label{{641a} \frac{{\langle H\rangle}{{V}\;=\; \frac{{1}{{8\pi}\left[\langle\Pi\rangle^2+\langle\phi\rangle^2\right] -2\int_{{\rm k}{{\cal E}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k} -2\int_{{\rm k}{{\cal E}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k} \;\;, \ee  \noindent where % \bea \label{{641b} {{\cal E}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}&=& \frac{{2k}{{k_0}\sqrt{{k^2_0-R^2_{{\rm k}}+\frac{{2\bar{{m}R_{{\rm k}}{{k_0} -\frac{{\bar m^2}{{k}+\frac{{\bar m^4}{{4k^2k_0}\;\;,\\\nonumber\\ \label{{641c} {{\cal E}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k}&=&\frac{{(\bar{{m}-m)k}{{k^3_0}W_{{\rm k}              \left(-kR_{{\rm k}+m\sqrt{{k^2_0-R^2_{{\rm k}}\right) \;\;. \eea  \noindent Substracting an unimportant constant $2k$ from ${{\cal E}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}$ we find, after a little algebra,   % \be \label{{642} {{\cal E}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}= -k\Bigl[\frac{{R_{{\rm k}}{{k_0}-\frac{{\bar m}{{k}\Bigr]^2 +\frac{{k}{{k_0}\Bigl[\frac{{\bar m^4}{{4k^3} -\frac{{R^4_{{\rm k}}{{k_0(k_0+\sqrt{{k^2_0-R^2_{{\rm k}})^2}\Bigr] \ee  \noindent from which it follows that % \be \label{{643} \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty} {{\cal E}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}= -\frac{{k}{{k^2_0}\left(-\frac{{\bar{{m}m^2}{{k(k+k_0)}+S_{{\rm k}\right)^2 +\frac{{k}{{k_0}\Bigl[\frac{{\bar m^4}{{4k^3} -\frac{{\bar m^4}{{4k_0^3} + {{\cal O}\left( \frac{{1}{{k^4} \right) \Bigr]\;\;. \ee  \noindent where we have used (\ref{{629}). It is clear now that this expression decrease as fast as $k^{{-5}$ and $\int_{{\rm k} {{\cal E}^{{(1)}_{{\rm k}$ is finite.  Comparing next (\ref{{641c}) with (\ref{{628c}) one notes immediately that  % \be \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty} {{\cal E}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k}  \;\;\sim \;\; \lim_{{k \rightarrow \infty} {{\cal F}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k} .  \ee  \noindent Hence, $\int_{{\rm k}{{\cal E}^{{(2)}_{{\rm k}$ is finite when the condition (\ref{{633}) is satisfied.   \indent The above qualitative discussion shows that the prescriptions given in (\ref{{629}), (\ref{{631}) and (\ref{{633}) can make energy density finite.  They will thus define the initial states and the system will develop a well defined time evolution within a limited moment space.  Because of the energy conservation, the asymptotic behavior of the Gaussian variables essentially will not be modified by the dynamics, otherwise this will cost infinite amount of energy from the system.  This discussion has not considered, however, possibilities of eventual runaway, caused by eventual unbounded below behavior of the potential.  The studies of this problem will require further detailed analysis of $\langle H\rangle$ as multidimensional function of $\bar m$, $R_{{\rm k}$ and $W_{{\rm k}$, (one coordinate for each $k$), and verification of its funcional properties \cite{{KL95}.    \smallskip \begin{{center} {{\bf VI.  Concluding Remarks} \end{{center} \smallskip  \indent In summary, we have presented in this paper a framework to treat the initial-value problem for interacting fermion-scalar field models.  The method allows one to describe the real-time evolution of the fields in terms of the dynamics of few observables yielding a set of  self-consistent equations for expectation values of linear and bilinear field operators.  Although the procedure  is quite general, we have however implemented the calculation within the simplest context of relativistic scalar plasma system.   We have shown in detail that the usual form of renormalization also applies to the present  nonperturbative calculation and we have obtained finite expression for energy density.  A simple numerical calculation suggests that the system has always a single stable minimum, although further investigation will be necessary for other oscillation modes.   The standard approach to this question is throught the use of RPA analysis, where the stability is indicated by its the eigenvalues.    It is interesting to mention here that the excitation modes described by the RPA equations are the quantum particles of the field.  In fact, the physics of one meson and two spin-1/2 fermion can be investigated from this equation.  We have also discussed the renormalization for the time-dependent equations.  Using energy conservation as the key, we found that there are a finite range around the vacuum where the dynamics of the system is well defined.   \indent Finally, we comment that systematic corrections to include dynamical correlation effects to the present mean-field calculations can in principle be readily applied  with the help of a projection technique discussed in I and Ref.\cite{{TNTP97}.   In this case, the occupation numbers are no longer constant and will affect the effective dynamics of the Gaussian observables.  The framework presented here serves also as groundwork to finite density and finite temperature discussions \cite{{TTP97}.  In particular, a finite-matter density calculation beyond the mean-field approximation allows one to study collisional observables such as transport coefficients \cite{{TP87}.  The extension of this procedure to explore nonuniform systems is straighforward but lengthy.  In this case, the spatial dependence of the field are expanded in natural orbitals of extented one-body density.  These orbitals can be given in terms of a momentum expansion through the use of a more general Bogoliubov transformation \cite{{RS80}.  \vskip 0.7cm \centerline{{\Large\bf ACKNOWLEDGMENTS} \vskip 0.7cm  E.R.T.N. and C-Y.

In the UV it corresponds to a light-cone gauging (Liouville model) whereas in the IR it is  a space-like gauging (2-d black hole). \end{{abstract}  \vspace{{5mm}  % %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % \section{{Introduction and summary}  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  In the AdS/CFT correspondence \cite{{050}, \cite{{062}, \cite{{390} the radial coordinate of the AdS space sets the energy scale of the world volume field theory.  The brane does not reside at infinity, instead the complete AdS space is expected to be dual (in proper limits) to the world volume field theory \cite{{053}. In the maximal supersymmetric case the world volume field theory is scale invariant and thus the field theory is conformal for any energy scale.  This means in the AdS picture that we could have set a cutoff at any other radius, it would reproduce the same boundary conformal field theory (CFT).  The situation changes however if we break supersymmetry, which can be done by orbifolding either in the spherical part or in the AdS part. Consider e.g.\ the case of $AdS_3 \times S_3$.  As we will discuss below AdS orbifolding introduces a black hole, which obviously break the scale invariance.  To be concrete, the orbifold $AdS_3/Z_n$ describes a BTZ black hole \cite{{160} (see also \cite{{410}) and it corresponds to the near-horizon geometry of a black string with momentum modes, where $n$ is the momentum number. On the other hand an $S_3$ orbifold corresponds to the embedding of a Taub-NUT space, which changes also the AdS part. E.g.\ the $AdS_3$ part of the $D1 \times D5$ intersection reads $ds^2 = r^2 du dv + (dr/r)^2$ and it becomes $ds^2 = r du dv + (dr/r)^2$ for $D1 \times D5$+Taub-NUT, i.e.\ the power of $r$ has changed. This is obvious due to the different harmonic functions.  So, this orbifolding breaks the scale invariance $r \rightarrow e^{{\lambda_D} r$ and $x_{{i} \rightarrow e^{{-\lambda_D} x_{{i}$, where $x_i$ are the world volume coordinates. Of course, in both cases we can restore the scale invariance locally by a proper coordinate transformation, but nevertheless they are globally different. Notice, coordinate transformations in the AdS space corresponds to an operator reparameterization of the boundary field theory.  In this letter we show, that the boundary CFT in the UV as well as in IR can be described by different gauged WZW models. In AdS gravity the asymptotic region (large radius) translates into the UV region of the CFT and the IR corresponds to the near-horizon region of the BTZ black hole.  The $AdS_3$ orbifolding fixes the subgroup, that has to be gauged: in the UV (asymptotic AdS region) the CFT is given by an ${{SL(2, {{\bf R}) \over SO(1,1)}$ WZW model and in the IR (near horizon region) one gets an ${{SL(2, {{\bf R}) \over U(1)}$ WZW model. Since the central charges of both CFT's differ, there is no exactly marginal deformation connecting both regions, i.e.\ there is a non-trivial renormalization group flow.  At many points we will be very brief and refer to \cite{{380} and \cite{{020} for more details and more references.    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  \section{{BTZ black hole as $AdS_3$ orbifolding}  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  A three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time is defined as a hyperboloid in a 4-d space with the signature $(-++-)$, i.e. \be010 -l^2 = -(X^0)^2 + (X^1)^2 + (X^2)^2 - (X^3)^2 = - z_1^+ z_1^- + z_2^+ z_2^- \ee where we introduced the coordinates  \be020 z_1^{{\pm} = l  \, e^{{\pm {{1 \over 2} (\theta_R  + \theta_L)} \, \cosh {{\lambda \over 2} \qquad , \qquad z_2^{{\pm} = l \, e^{{\pm {{1 \over 2} (\theta_R  - \theta_L)}\, \sinh {{\lambda \over 2}  \ . \ee The metric reads \be030 ds^2 = - dz_1^+ dz_1^- + dz_2^+ dz_2^- = {{l^2 \over 4}  \Big(d\lambda^2 + d\theta_R^2 + d \theta_L^2 + 2 \cosh\lambda \, d\theta_R d\theta_L \Big) \ . \ee Defining $\theta_R = (y + t)/l$, $\theta_L = ( y -t)/l$ and $\lambda = 2 \rho$ the metric can also be written as \be040 ds^2 = l^2 d\rho^2 + \cosh^2\rho \, dy^2 - \sinh^2\rho \, dt^2  \ . \ee Furthermore, the $AdS_3$ space is the $SL(2, {{\rm \bf R})$ group space and a group element $g$ can be written as \renewcommand{{\arraystretch}{{1.2} \be050 g =     e^{{\theta_L T_1} \; e^{{ \lambda T_2} \; e^{{ \theta_R T_1} \ = \         \left(\ba{{cc} \cosh{{\theta_L \over 2} & \sinh{{\theta_L\over 2} \\         \sinh{{\theta_L \over 2} & \cosh{{\theta_L \over 2} \ea \right)         \left(\ba{{cc} e^{{\lambda/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{{- \lambda/2} \ea \right)         \left(\ba{{cc} \cosh{{\theta_R \over 2} & \sinh{{\theta_R \over 2} \\         \sinh{{\theta_R \over 2} & \cosh{{\theta_R \over 2} \ea \right) \ee \renewcommand{{\arraystretch}{{1.7} with the $SL(2, \bf R)$ algebra \be060  [ T_a , T_b ] = \epsilon_{{ab}^{{ \ \  c} T_c, \hspace{{0,5cm} % [ T_a , \bar T_b ] = 0, \hspace{{0,5cm}  {{\rm Tr} (T_a T_b) = \frac{{1}{{2} \eta_{{ab} \ee ($\eta= {{\rm diag}(-1,1,1)$, $\epsilon^{{012}=1$).

Notice,  this orbifold breaks all supersymmetries, which coincides with the non-extremality of the BTZ black hole metric (\ref{{100}).  In the next section we will see, that in the supersymmetric case ($r_+ = r_-$) one chiral current drops out and we get an orbifolding only in $\theta_L$ \be142 \theta_{{L} \simeq \theta_{{L} + {{4 \pi \over n} \qquad {{\rm or} \qquad z_1^{{\pm} \simeq e^{{\pm  {{2 \pi \over n}} z_1^{{\pm} \quad , \quad z_2^{{\pm} \simeq e^{{\mp  {{2 \pi \over n}} z_2^{{\pm} \ . \ee This orbifold can be seen as lens space for $AdS_3$, by appropriate Wick rotation we can obtain the $S_3$ lens space \cite{{420}.   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  \section{{Conformal fixpoints}  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  In the previous section we have argued that ``adding'' a BTZ black hole to the $AdS_3$ space corresponds to an orbifolding. One may regard this black hole as a (small) perturbation of the asymptotic CFT and the corresponding states, which are invariant under this orbifold, can be related to microstates of the BTZ black hole and therewith to 4-d black holes, see e.g.\ \cite{{360}, \cite{{370}.  On the other hand, since the radial coordinate corresponds to the energy scale, this asymptotic CFT describes the UV fixpoint.  One goal of this letter is, to investigate the IR fixpoint and the CFT that describes this fixpoint. Obviously, a flow towards the IR corresponds to the radial movement and if there is a further fixpoint we may expect them near the horizon.  To make this more explicit we can employ the fact, that 3-d AdS gravity can be described by a Chern-Simons theory and is exactly solvable \cite{{170}, \cite{{180}.  Decomposing the $AdS_3$ diffeomorphism group $SO(2,2) \simeq SL(2,{{\bf R})_L \times SL(2, {{\bf R})_R$, the 3-dimensional action can be written as \be150 S = S_{{CS} [A] \ - \  S_{{CS} [\bar A] \ee with \be160 S_{{CS} [A] = \frac{{k}{{4 \pi} \int_{{M_3} d^3 x         {{\rm Tr} \ \Big(AdA + \frac{{2}{{3} A^3 \Big)  \ee where we will adopt the notation where the level $k = l$ (in other notations $k= 2\pi l/ \kappa_3$).  The gauge field one-forms are \be170 A = (\omega^a + \frac{{1}{{l} e^a) \ T_a \ \in SL(2,{{\bf R})_R \ , \hspace{{1cm} \bar A = ( \omega^a - \frac{{1}{{l} e^a) \ \bar T_a \ \in SL(2,{{\bf R})_L. \ee where $\omega^a \equiv \frac{{1}{{2} \epsilon^{{abc} \omega_{{bc}$ are given by the spin-connections $\omega_{{bc}$ and $e^a$ are the dreibeine. Due to boundaries the Chern-Simons theory is not invariant under gauge transformations and as a consequence gauge degrees of freedom do not decouple and become dynamical on the boundaries. These are the degrees of freedom of the conformal field theories living at the boundaries.  In the following we will discuss this procedure for the BTZ black hole. The geometry of the manifold is $M_3 = {{\bf R} \times \Sigma$, where ${{\bf R}$ corresponds to the time of the covering space of $AdS_3$ and $\Sigma$ represents an ``annulus'' $r_+ \leq r < \infty$.  Calculating the gauge connections $A= A^a T_a$ and $\bar A = \bar A^a \bar T_a$ for the BTZ solution (\ref{{100}) one finds exactly the fields (\ref{{120}), for details see \cite{{020}.  In order to extract the CFTs at the boundaries we have to perform two steps: (i) we have to add boundary terms that impose the correct boundary conditions and (ii) we have to mod out the isometry group related to the orbifold, that corresponds to the Killing direction that has been periodically identified in constructing the BTZ black hole.  (i) As dictated by the Chern-Simons solution (\ref{{120}) we will impose as boundary conditions \be180 A_u = \bar A_v =0 \ee and therefore we add as boundary term to the action \be190 \delta S = {{k \over 8\pi} \int_{{\partial M} Tr (A_v A_u + \bar A_v \bar A_u) \ . \ee Since we have flat gauge connection we insert $A = g^{{-1} dg$ and $\bar A = \bar g^{{-1} d \bar g$ into the action and obtain as result an $SL(2, {{\bf R})$ WZW model \cite{{150}.   (ii) In a second step we translate the orbifolding (\ref{{140}) into a gauging of an $SL(2, {{\bf R})$ group direction. {{From} the Chern-Simons fields (\ref{{120}) we find \be200 \ba{{rl} {{\rm for}\ r \rightarrow \infty:\quad &   A \ = \ {{r\over l} (T_1 + T_0)   \; {{dv \over l} + T_2 \; {{dr \over r} \ = \ {{r\over l} \, T_+   \, {{dv \over l} + T_2 \; {{dr \over r}   \\   & \bar A \ =\ - {{r\over l} (T_1 - T_0) \; {{du \over l} - T_2 \; {{dr \over r}   \ = \ - {{r\over l} \, T_- \, {{du \over l} - T_2 \; {{dr \over r} \ . \ea \ee with $T_{{\pm} = T_1 \pm T_0$.  Therefore, the orbifolding in $\theta_{{L/R} \sim u/v$ corresponds to a gauging of the lightcone group directions $T_{{\pm}$. On the other hand, in the IR ($\lambda \rightarrow 0$) we reach the horizon boundary $r\rightarrow r_+$ and the gauge fields become \be210 \ba{{ll} {{\rm for } \quad r \rightarrow r_+  \quad ({{\rm or} \quad  \lambda \rightarrow 0)  :  \quad &   A \ = \ {{1 \over l} (r_+ - r_-) \; T_1  \; {{dv \over l} +   \; T_2 \; d\lambda \\   & \bar A \ =\ - {{1\over l}(r_+ + r_-) \; T_1 \; {{du \over l} -   \; T_2 \; d\lambda  \ea \ee where $\lambda$ is defined by the radial coordinate for which $A_r$ and $\bar A_r$ are constant. So we see, that in this case the orbifolding translates into a gauging of the $T_1$ group direction.  Both gauged WZW models have been discussed some time ago.  The gauging of a lightcone group direction, i.e.\ an ${{SL(2, {{\bf R}) \over SO(1,1)}$ WZW model corresponds to a Liouville model \cite{{400}, \cite{{210}, where the Liouville field corresponds to the radial coordinate \cite{{211}; see also \cite{{390}.  The gauging of a spatial direction yields an ${{SL(2, {{\bf R}) \over U(1)}$ WZW model, which describes a 2-d black hole solution \cite{{140}, \cite{{210}. Both solutions are known to be exact CFTs, but with different central charges.  For the Liouville model, describing the CFT in the UV region, the central charge is \cite{{210} \be220 c_{{UV} = 1 + 6(k-2) Q^2 = {{3k \over k-2} - 2 + 6k  \ee where $Q={{k -1 \over k - 2}$ is the background charge of the Liouville field ($k = {{l \over 4 \alpha'}$). On the other hand the CFT in the IR has the central charge \be260 c_{{IR} = {{3k \over k-2} - 1 \ . \ee Due to the difference in the central charges there cannot be an exactly marginal deformation between both CFT's. So, there is a non-trivial renormalization group flow (see also \cite{{250}), which corresponds to the bulk physics of the BTZ black hole.  Due to the holographic nature, the complete bulk physics will be fixed by these boundary CFTs.  However, let us stress that at any finite point in space time one can promote the background to an exact CFT. On one hand the gauged WZW model can be made exact by changing the renormalization group scheme (field redefinitions) \cite{{320} and on the other hand the BTZ black hole is locally at any point $AdS_3$. The different central charges indicate the non-trivial global structure of the model and it is better thought of as an interpolating solution between two (different) CFTs.  Finally, we will comment on the supersymmetric case where the BTZ black hole becomes extremal, i.e.\ $r_- = r_+$.  In this case the Chern-Simons field $A$ decouples and the CFT is coverned by one chiral current ($\bar A$) only. In fact, if we first discuss the IR limit ($r \rightarrow r_+$) we see from (\ref{{210}) that $A_v = 0$ and due to the boundary condition (\ref{{180}) also $A_u =0$ and thus $A$ drops completely ($A_r$ was fixed due to the choice of the coordinates).  On the other hand in the UV we get the same asymptotic behavior as for the non-extremal case. But by performing the orbifolding in $\theta_L$ (gauging of the $T_-$ direction) one truncates the theory already to Liouville\footnote{{By gauging a light-cone direction one gets rid of two degrees of freedom \cite{{210}.}, i.e.\ one has to gauge only one light-cone direction.  Hence, in the extremal case the  Chern-Simons field $A$ decouples from the CFT in the IR as well as in the UV. These two points are boundaries for the Chern-Simons theory and since gauge degrees of freedom can become dynamical only on these boundaries, we can disregard the $A$ field completely. Therefore, as expected the supersymmetric case is governed by only one chiral Chern-Simons field and corresponds only to the orbifold of $\theta_L$ in (\ref{{142}).  \vspace{{1cm}   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%     % % ---- Bibliography ---- % % \nocite{{*}                   %this uses *everything* in the .bib file % \bibliography{{corfu}          %or whatever your .bib file is % \bibliographystyle{{utphys}   %if you use utphys.bst  % \begin{{thebibliography}{{3} \providecommand{{\href}[2]{{#2}\begingroup\raggedright\begin{{thebibliography}{{10}  \bibitem{{050} J.~Maldacena, ``The large n limit of superconformal field theories and   supergravity,'' {{\em Adv.

This renewed interest  is motivated  both  from the point of view of AdS/CFT  correspondence, providing new insights in the study of RGE flows (see e.g.,  \cite{{010,190,180,220,020,150,160,030,230,BC,deBVV}  and references therein) as well as  from the phenomenological perspective, providing a possible resolution to hierarchy problem in the context of  a world on a domain wall in D=5 asymptotically AdS space-times (see, e.g.,   \cite{{050,070,060,240,250,260,211,261,081} and references therein). This is an exiting period when formal theoretical developments drive  phenomenological implications and vice versa.  A prerequisite for  addressing physics implications of such configurations is a detailed understanding of their space-time structure.  Earlier work   on the subject concentrated on the domain walls in D=4 space-time dimensions, where either side of the wall  was to be interpreted  as that of our four-dimensional Universe. The first example of static domain walls between vacua with different cosmological constants were found is \cite{{CGRI} as supersymmetric (BPS-saturated/extreme) walls interpolating between supersymmetric vacua of D=4 $N=1$ supergravity vacua. In  \cite{{CGI} a classification of the possible supersymmetric walls has been given, and the global structure of the space-times induced by these walls has been explored in \cite{{CDGS,Gibb}. A subsequent systematic  investigation \cite{{CGSII}  of the space-times of domain walls separating regions of non-positive cosmological constant in Einstein's theory of gravitation,  revealed a more general class of domain wall configurations.\footnote{{Space-time properties of non-static domain walls in D=5 were recently addressed in \cite{{170,171,Binetruy,Tye,Csaki,Kraus,Sasaki,Garriga} and references therein.  As the results of this paper demonstrate, the space-time structure of  domain walls in $D$-dimensions (including $D=4$) is  completely parallel.} (For a review, see  \cite{{CS}.)  The purpose of the present work is to generalize the  results  of the  study of vacuum domain walls in D=4 \cite{{CGSII} to (D-2)-brane-configurations in D-dimensions, with   D=5  being of special interest to the physics-implications for  the four-dimensional   domain wall-world (as well as of  theoretical interest for   RGE flows of strongly coupled gauge-theories in four dimensions).  Following the work of \cite{{CGSII} we  derive  the local and global properties of the space-times induced by vacuum domain  walls in D-dimensions  between vacua of arbitrary cosmological constant. We start with the {{\em Ansatz\/} that the gravitational field inherits the boost symmetry of the source, but we assume nothing about the topology of the (D-1)-dimensional space-times parallel to the surface of the domain wall. The space-time intrinsic to the wall,   are Freedman-Lema{{\^ i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes describing locally  (D-1)-dimensional space-times with   anti-deSitter (AdS$_{{D-1}$), Minkowski (M$_{{D-1}$) or de~Sitter  (dS$_{{D-1}$) space-times.  For each of these space-times internal to the  wall,  the  space-time transverse to the wall can  be classified according  to the values of cosmological constants  $\Lambda_{{1,2}$ on either side of the wall and  their relationship to the energy density of the wall $\sigma$.    An  important result of the analysis is that the   space-times of domain walls  have the same universal structure in   all D; the space-time intrinsic to the wall  is that of (D-1)-dimensional    FLRW universe, and the  metric coefficient, specifying the space-time   transverse to the wall has the same form  with  parameters  depending  on  $\Lambda_i/[(D-1)(D-3)]$.    The paper is organized as follows.  In Section \ref{{grsection}  we derive  the line-element Ansatz,  by working  in the comoving frame of the wall in D-dimensions.   In Section \ref{{classification} we classify the  domain wall solutions according to their energy-density and the values of   cosmological constants on either side. We present the discussion of the result in Section\ \ref{{discussion}  , including the implications for their non-extreme generalizations.  In particular, we discuss the examples in  $D=5$, which  have been recently studied intensively.       \section{{local properties of domain wall space-times} \label{{grsection}  \addtocounter{{equation}{{-\value{{equation}}   In this section we present the metric Ansatz for  vacuum domain walls for Einstein gravity in D-dimensions; these walls,  created from a scalar field source,  separate vacuum space-times of zero, positive, and negative cosmological constants. We study in detail only infinitely thin domain walls, by employing Israel's formalism\cite{{ISR} of singular hypersurfaces.    \subsection{{Metric Ansatz}  We solve D-dimensional  Einstein's gravitational field equations  in the co-moving frame of the domain wall, by assuming the following symmetry of the metric Ansatz \cite{{CGSII}: \begin{{itemize} \item The spatial part of the metric intrinsic to the wall is {{\em homogeneous\/}  and {{\em isotropic.\/} \item The space-time section transverse  to the wall is {{\em static.\/} \item The directions parallel to the wall are {{\em boost invariant\/} in the strong sense. \end{{itemize}   Homogeneity and isotropy reduce the   metric part, intrinsic to the wall,  to be    the spatial part of a (D-1)-dimensional Friedmann-Lema{{\^{{\i}}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric~\cite{{MTW} of the form \begin{{equation} (ds_{{\parallel})^2=R^2\left[(1-kr^2)^{{-1}dr^2+r^2 d\Omega_{{D-3}^2\right] , \label{{dstwo} \end{{equation} where $R$ is independent of the  radial coordinate  $r$ and  the angular coordinates $\phi_i$ ($i=1,\cdots , D-3$)  specifying the line element $d\Omega_{{D-3}^2$ of  (D-3)-sphere $S^{{D-3}$. The scalar curvature of this surface is equal to $2k/R^2$.  The sign of $k$ determines the wall geometry.  $k=0$ defines a planar wall, in which case the metric (\ref{{dstwo}) can be written in Cartesian coordinates $(ds_{{\parallel})^2 = R^{{2} (\sum_{{i=1}^{{D-2}dx_i^2)$. $k>0$ corresponds to a  spherical wall-- closed bubble-- with  $r$ and $\phi_i$'s  %($i=1,\cdots, D-3$)   being compact coordinates;  through a coordinate transformation $r=k^{{-1/2}\sin\!\theta$ and rescaling of $R$, the line-element can be written as   $(ds_{{\parallel})^2=R^2 ( d\theta^2+\sin^2{{\!\theta} d\Omega_{{D-3}^2)=R^2d\Omega_{{D-2}^2$. $k<0$ corresponds to the negative curvature, non-compact Gauss-B{{\'{{o}}lyai-Lobachevski surface; introducing  $r = (-k)^{{-1/2}\sinh\!\varrho$, with $\varrho>0 $, and rescaling $R$ yields  $(ds_{{\parallel})^{{2} = R^2 (d\varrho^{{2} +  \sinh^2\!\varrho \,d\Omega_{{D-3}^{{2})$.   The condition that the two-dimensional space-time $(t,z)$ transverse to the wall is  {{\em static\/} (as observed in the  {{\em rest frame\/} of the wall) implies the following form of  the transverse part of the metric: \begin{{equation} (ds_{{\perp})^2=A(z)\left(dt^2-dz^2\right) , \end{{equation} where $z$ is the spatial direction transverse to the wall, $t$ is the  {{\em proper} time and $A(z) > 0$. With $ds^2\equiv (ds_{{\perp})^2-(ds_{{\parallel})^2$ the metric takes the form: \begin{{equation} ds^2=A(z)\left(dt^2-dz^2\right)-R(t,z)^2\left[(1-kr^2)^{{-1}dr^2+r^2d\Omega_{{D-3}^2 \right] . \label{{Ansatz} \end{{equation} in which $z\in\langle -\infty, \infty\rangle$, and the other coordinates are those of the  FLRW cosmological model \cite{{MTW}.  %In the following we employ Einstein's equations to  A straight-forward calculation of the nonzero components of the Einstein tensor $G^{{\mu}_{{\;\;\nu} = {{\cal R}^{{\mu}_{{\:\:\nu} - {{1\over 2} {{\cal R}^{{\alpha}_{{\;\;\alpha} g^{{\mu}_{{\;\; \nu}$ yields the result:   \begin{{equation}   \left.\begin{{array}{{ccl} G^{{t}_{{\;t}&=& \frac{{D-2}{{A}  \left[ - \frac{{R''}{{R} + \frac{{H R'}{{2 R} \right]  + \frac{{(D-3)(D-2)}{{2R^2} \left[ k + \frac{{\dot{{R}^2 - R^{{'2}}{{A} \right] \\ {{\mbox{{ }}& & {{\mbox{{ }}\\ G^{{z}_{{\;t}&=& \frac{{D-2}{{A} \left[  {{{{\dot{{R}'}\over{{R}}-{{{{H\dot{{R}}\over{{2 R}} \right]\\ {{\mbox{{ }}& & {{\mbox{{ }}\\ G^{{z}_{{\;z}&=&  \frac{{D-2}{{A}  \left[ \frac{{\ddot{{R}}{{R} - \frac{{H R'}{{2 R} \right] + \frac{{(D-3)(D-2)}{{2R^2}  \left[ k + \frac{{\dot{{R}^2 - R^{{'2}}{{A} \right] \\ {{\mbox{{ }}& & {{\mbox{{ }}\\ G^{{r}_{{\;r}&=&G^{{\phi_i}_{{\;\;\phi_i}= \frac{{3-D}{{A}  \left[ {{{{R''}\over{{R}} - {{{{\ddot{{R}}\over{{R}} \right]   -{{{{H'}\over{{2A}} - \frac{{(D-3)(D-4)}{{2R^2}  \left[ k + \frac{{\dot{{R}^2 - R^{{'2}}{{A} \right]           \end{{array}   \right.\label{{einst} \end{{equation} where $i=1\cdots D-3$, $\dot{{R} \equiv \partial_{{t}R(t,z)$,  $R'\equiv \partial_zR(t,z)$ and $H \equiv \partial_{{z}\ln A(z)$.  The symmetry of the  matter source (as specified in the rest  frame of the wall) implies that the energy-momentum tensor is static,   with   $T^{{ z}_{{\;\; t}=0$ (no energy flow in the $(t,z)$-plane)  and $T^{{\mu}_{{\;\;\mu}=g_\mu(z)$  ($\mu=(t,z,r,\phi_i)$), where  $g_\mu(z)$ are functions of $z$, only.  Then  the Einstein's equations   $G^{{\mu}_{{\;\; \nu}=\kappa_D T^{{ \mu}_{{\; \; \nu}$ imply the following constraints on $R(t,z)$ and $A(z)$ \footnote{{  $\kappa_D$ is defined as $\kappa_D\equiv 8\pi G_D$, where $G_D$ is Newton's constant in D-dimensions. We define the Lagrangian density as ${{1\over \kappa_D}(-{{R\over 2}+ {{\cal L}_{{matter}).$}:  \begin{{equation} \left.\begin{{array}{{ccl}{{{{\dot{{R}'}\over{{R}}-{{{{H\dot{{R}}\over{{2 R}}&=&0,  \label{{ti1}\\ {{\mbox{{ }}& & {{\mbox{{ }}\\ \frac{{R''}{{R} - \frac{{H R'}{{2 R}&=&f_2(z),\label{{ti2}\\  {{\mbox{{ }}& & {{\mbox{{ }}\\  {{{{R''}\over{{R}} - {{{{\ddot{{R}}\over{{R}}&=&f_3(z),\label{{ti3}\\   {{\mbox{{ }}& & {{\mbox{{ }}\\ \frac{{k}{{R^2} + \frac{{\dot{{R}^2 - R^{{'2}}{{AR^2}&=&f_4(z), \label{{ti4}  \end{{array}   \right.   \label{{ti} \end{{equation} where $f_{{1,2,3}(z)$ are arbitrary functions of $z$.  The static metric Ansatz ${{\dot{{R}}=0$ automatically satisfies Eqs. (\ref{{ti}).  For non-static metric, time- integration of the first Eq. in  (\ref{{ti}) yields the condition  \begin{{equation} R'=\frac{{HR}{{2} + f_1(z) \label{{ztint} \end{{equation} with  $f_1(z)$  an arbitrary function of $z$. Adding $z$-derivative of (\ref{{ztint}) to  the second Eq.  in  (\ref{{ti}) yields a condition $f_{{1}(z)'= [-{{H' \over 2}+f_2(z)]R$, which holds for any $t$ only if $f_1(z)=f_0$ is a constant and  $f_2(z)={{H' \over 2}$.   The assumption of  boost-invariance along the surfaces of constant $z$  implies that $f_0=0$ and as a consequence, Eq.(\ref{{ztint}) is solved by  $R^2(r,t)=A(z)S^2(t)$. (In the static case, i.e. $\dot{{R}=0$, the same symmetry constraint also  implies $R^2(z)\propto A(z)$.)\footnote{{ Namely, we assume that the gravitational field inherits the symmetry of the source; the directions parallel to the wall are boost invariant in the strong sense and thick walls will have  the same $S(t)$ as found in the thin wall approximation and will asymptotically approach the  thin wall result for $A(z)$. (See \cite{{CGSII} for a more detailed discussion.)}  Therefore, the metric Ansatz  takes the form: \begin{{equation} ds^2= A(z)\left\{{ dt^2-dz^2-S^2(t) \left[(1-kr^2)^{{-1}dr^2+r^2 d\Omega_{{D-3}^2\right]\right\}, \label{{ansatz} \end{{equation} which  has a universal form for any D-dimensions, and thus the same  structure as the one  obtained in D=4 \cite{{CGSII}. This  result is due to the fact that  in the wall comoving frame   the  homogeneity and isotropy of space-time internal to the  wall severely restrict the form  of the   Einstein tensor to be that of Eq. (\ref{{einst});   the static space-time transverse to the wall and   the boost invariance along the wall further fixes the metric to  be of   the  universal, D-independent form (\ref{{ansatz}).    In the following Subsection we solve  the Einstein equations for $A(z)$ and $S(t)$, which  specify the possible     space-time structure  away from the domain wall. We then employ the infinitely thin wall approximation \cite{{ISR}  in order to determine the  energy density of the wall in terms of the  parameters in the metric.   \subsection{{Local space-time solutions}  \label{{subsubvacuum}  We now solve Einstein's equations for $S(t)$ and $A(z)$  of  the metric Ansatz (\ref{{ansatz}). We consider thin domain walls interpolating between two maximally symmetric vacua of zero, positive, or negative cosmological constant.% % thus  % generalizing  the $D=4$ solutions studied in \cite{{CGSII} to arbitrary  %dimensions.~ \footnote{{  Maximally symmetric vacuum solutions are well known \cite{{MTW}; nevertheless, we summarize the results here for  the   comoving coordinate system of the wall. Note also that   Israel's matching conditions  are easily satisfied in this frame.}  Plugging the metric Ansatz (\ref{{ansatz}), i.e.  $R^2(t,z)=A(z)S^2(t)$ in the Einstein tensor (\ref{{einst}),  yields the  following equations for $S(t)$ and $A(z)$: \begin{{equation} {{\ddot{{S}\over  S}=q_{{0}={{\dot{{S}^2\over S^2}+{{k\over S^2} , \label{{seq} \end{{equation} %Einstein equation $G^{{z}_{{\;\;z}=\Lambda$ then gives  \begin{{equation} {{1\over 4} \left({{A'\over A}\right)^2=q_{{0}-\frac{{\Lambda}{{(D-3)(D-1)} A , \label{{aeq} \end{{equation} where  we have assumed that away  from the wall, the energy momentum tensor   is given by $T_{{\;\;\nu}^{{\mu}=\Lambda \delta^\mu_{{\;\;\nu}$   with $\Lambda$ the cosmological constant on either side of the wall. $q_0$   is an integration constant  satisfying    the  consistency constraint $\Lambda A(z) \le (D-3)(D-1) q_{{0} $.   Since the equation for $S(t)$ is independent of dimensionality,   the space-time  intrinsic to the wall is universal.  %(extensively discussed in \cite{{CGSII}).   Eq. (\ref{{aeq}) for  $A(z)$, i.e. the metric  coefficient  specifying the space-time transverse to the wall,    is  also of the same   form   as that obtained in D=4,  except for the  D-dependent   coefficient in front of the    cosmological constant. We choose  to parameterize the  cosmological constant as:  \begin{{equation} \Lambda \equiv \pm (D-3)(D-1)\alpha^{{2} \equiv \pm \Delta \alpha^2. \label{{lambda}\end{{equation} Thus, in terms of the parameter  $\alpha$, Eq. (\ref{{aeq}) has a universal, D-independent form and thus  yields  the same solutions  as the ones obtained in D=4 \cite{{CGSII}.  The fact that the  domain wall space-time structure is universal, was  anticipated in \cite{{CS}. Nevertheless, the  result  is  intriguing; {{\it both the local as well as the global space-time properties of domain walls  ((D-2)-configurations) in  diverse (D) dimensions are universal.}   The study of  the  local and global  domain wall space-times in D=4 \cite{{CGSII} can therefore be extended in a straightforward way to the study of (D-2)-configurations in D-dimensions. (The special case of D=5 recently  attracted much attention due to its phenomenological implications.)   For the sake of completeness, we shall now write down  the  explicit results for $S(t)$ and $A(z)$ \cite{{CGSII}.   We parameterize the curvature constant of the space-time internal to the wall  (see discussion at the beginning of the previous subsection) as $k\in\{{-\beta^2,0,\beta^2\}$.  The solutions of $S(t)$ from Eq.\ (\ref{{seq}) can be   classified according to the sign of $q_{{0}$:  \begin{{eqnarray} q_0=-\beta^2: \ \ S_{{-} &=& \cos (\beta t  %+ \theta_1 )\;\;\;\;\;\;\; k=-\beta^2, \label{{smin}\\ q_0=0:\ \ S_{{0}\; &=&  \left\{{ \begin{{array}{{ll}           \beta t  	  %+ \theta_2  	  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;  \;       & 	   k=-\beta^2, \\              1 	     %\theta_3  	                  & k=0,            \end{{array}     \right. \label{{snull}\\ q_0=\beta^2:\ \ S_{{+} &=&  \left\{{ \begin{{array}{{ll} \sinh (\beta t  %+ \theta_4 )\;\;\,\,  &  k=-\beta^2, \\  e^{{\beta t  % + \theta_5  }     &  k=0 ,       \\  \cosh (\beta t  % + \theta_6  ) &  k=\beta^2, \end{{array} \right. \label{{splus} \end{{eqnarray} where the subscripts ($-,0,+$) refer to the respective  sign of $q_0$. (Due to the  time-translation  and time-reversal invariance,  the integration constants   are adjusted to yield the canonical form for $S(t)$, and without loss of generality,  $\beta \ge 0$ is chosen.) The form of the solutions $S_{{-,0,+}$ (Eqs.(\ref{{smin})-(\ref{{splus}))   implies that the space-time intrinsic  to the wall is that of    AdS$_{{D-1}$, M$_{{D-1}$   and dS$_{{D-1}$, respectively.        Solutions of (\ref{{aeq}), classified according to the sign of $q_0$,  yield the following form of $A(z)$: \begin{{eqnarray} q_0=-\beta^2: \ \ A_{{-} &= & \begin{{array}{{ll}  \beta^2 [ \alpha \cos (\beta z+\vartheta ) ]^{{-2} & \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \;\;\;\;\;\; \Lambda =-\Delta \alpha^2  \leq -\Delta \beta^2,            \end{{array} \label{{amin}\;\;\;  \\ q_0=0:\ \ A_{{0}\;&=&\left\{{ \begin{{array}{{ll}   ( \alpha z\pm 1)^{{-2} & \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \;\;\;\;\; \; \Lambda = -\Delta \alpha^2,\\ 1     & \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \;\;\;\;\; \; \Lambda =0,           \end{{array} \right. \label{{anull}\\ q_0=\beta^2:\ \ A_{{+}&=&\left\{{ \begin{{array}{{ll} \beta^2 [\alpha \sinh(\beta z-\beta z')]^{{-2}  & \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\, \Lambda = -\Delta\alpha^2,\\ e^{{\pm 2\beta z}  & \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\, \Lambda =0,\\ \beta^2 [\alpha \cosh(\beta z-\beta z'')]^{{-2}  & \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\,  \Lambda =\Delta \alpha^2\leq \Delta \beta^2, \end{{array} \right. \label{{aplus} \end{{eqnarray} Again, the subscripts ($-,0,+$) for  $A(z)$ refer to the sign of $q_{{0}$. Without loss of generality we have moved the origin of the $z$-axis to the position of the wall ($z_{{0}=0$). The three integration constants $\vartheta$, $z'$, and $z''$ are determined by the requirement that we choose $A(z_0=0)=1$ which yields: % \cite{{CGSII}: \begin{{eqnarray} \vartheta_{{\pm}&=&\pm {{\mbox{{arccos}} (\beta/\alpha),\\ \beta z'_{{\pm} &=& \frac{{1}{{2}\ln \left[1+ {{2\beta^2\over\alpha^2}\pm {{2\beta\over\alpha^2} (\alpha^2+\beta^2)^{{1/2}\right],\label{{deltadet}\\ \beta z''_{{\pm} &=& \frac{{1}{{2}\ln\left[-1+ {{2\beta^2\over\alpha^2}\mp {{2\beta\over\alpha^2} (\beta^2-\alpha^2)^{{1/2}\right]. \label{{gammadet} \end{{eqnarray} The constants $\beta z'$ and $\beta z''$ satisfy $e^{{2\beta (z'_{{+}+z'_{{-})}= e^{{2\beta (z''_{{+}+z''_{{-})}=1$ and $e^{{2\beta z''_{{-}}>1 > e^{{2\beta z''_{{+}}$ and $e^{{2\beta z'_{{-}}\le 1 \le e^{{2\beta z'_{{+}}$ where in the last case, the equality is obtained when $\beta = 0$-the extreme limit is taken.  (As one can see from Eq.\ (\ref{{gammadet}), there is no extreme limit ($\beta\rightarrow 0$)\ in the de~Sitter case.)   \subsection{{Israel's matching conditions and surface energy density of the domain walls} \label{{subsubisrael}  In the thin wall approximation, the energy-momentum tensor and the  Einstein tensor have $\delta$-function singularities at the wall.  In Israel's formalism \cite{{ISR} for singular layers  the metric tensor has a discontinuity in its first order  derivatives in the direction transverse to the wall, and   the Lanczos tensor ${{\cal{{S}}^{{i}_{{\;j}$, which is   the surface energy-momentum tensor of the wall located at $z_{{0}$,   is related to the discontinuity of the     extrinsic curvature $K^{{i}_{{\;j}$ in the following way: \begin{{equation} \kappa_{{D} {{\cal{{S}}^{{i}_{{\;j}  = - [K^{{i}_{{\;j}]^{{-}  + \delta^{{i}_{{\;j}[K]^{{-}. \end{{equation} The square brackets $[\;\;\;]^{{-}$ is defined as $[\Omega]^{{-} \equiv   \lim_{{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}(\Omega(z_{{0}+\epsilon))   - \Omega(z_{{0}-\epsilon))$ and  $x^{{i} \in \{{t,r,\phi_i \}$ ($i=1,\cdots , D-3$) are the coordinates parallel to the wall.  $K^{{i}_{{\;j}$ is given by the covariant derivative   of the space-like unit normal  $n^{{\mu}$ of   the wall's hyper-space-time. In a normalized coordinate system where $g_{{\hat{{z}\hat{{z}}=-1$,  the extrinsic curvature can be written as  $K_{{i j} = -{{ \zeta \over 2}g_{{ij,\hat{{z}}\, $  where $\zeta = \pm 1$ signifies  the inherent sign ambiguity of the unit normal $n^{{\mu}$. Hence, in a  comoving coordinate frame, where we have chosen   $A(z_0=0)=1$,  the Lanczos  tensor can be  written as  \begin{{equation} \kappa_{{D} {{\cal{{S}}^{{i}_{{\;j}=-\delta^{{i}_{{\;j}[\zeta H]^{{-}_{{z=0}. \label{{sij} \end{{equation} The  energy density of the wall $\sigma\equiv {{\cal{{S}}^{{t}_{{\; t}$, which is equal to the wall's tension $\tau\equiv {{\cal{{S}}^{{r}_{{\;r}={{\cal{{S}}^{{\phi_i}_{{\;\phi_i}$, is given by \begin{{equation} \kappa_D\sigma=-[\zeta H]^{{-}_{{z=0}. \label{{sigdef} \end{{equation} Applying Israel's formalism to the local  vacuum solutions  specified by  Eqs. (\ref{{smin})-  %, \ref{{snull}, \ref{{splus}, \ref{{amin}, \ref{{anull},   (\ref{{aplus}), we find the surface energy density $\sigma$, and tension   $\tau=\sigma$, to be of the form:  \begin{{equation} \kappa_D\sigma = 2\zeta_{{1}h_{{1}\left(q_{{0}-{{\Lambda_{{1} \over (D-3)(D-1)}\right)^{{1/2} -2\zeta_{{2}h_{{2}\left(q_{{0}-{{\Lambda_{{2}\over (D-3)(D-1)}\right)^{{1/2} , \label{{gensig} \end{{equation} where the first [second] contribution to the energy density  comes from $z<0$ [$z>0$] side of the wall. We choose, without loss of generality, to orient the $z$-coordinate so that the vacuum of lowest energy will be placed on the $z<0$ side (i.e. $\Lambda_1<\Lambda_2$).   In Eq. (\ref{{gensig}), in additional to the ambiguity in the sign of the unit normal $n^{{\mu}$ ($\zeta_{{i} =\pm 1$), there is  another sign ambiguity, $h_{{i} = \pm 1$,  in taking the square-root of Eq.\ (\ref{{aeq}).  A kink-like solution for the wall  i.e. the scalar interpolating between the extrema of the potential,  implies   $\zeta_{{1} =  \zeta_{{2}=1$.  In addition, we take $h_{{i}=1$ if $A_{{i}(z)$ is an increasing function of $z$;  and $h_{{i}=-1$ if $A_{{i}(z)$ is decreasing.  The domain wall solutions fall into two categories: those with   positive energy density (corresponding to   the infinitely thin wall limit of a kink solution,   interpolating between  the  {{\it minima} of the potential)     and those with   negative energy density which correspond to choosing   the reversed values of $h_i$.  Examples of negative tension walls are encountered in  gauged supergravity theories (see, e.g., \cite{{BC}) as a consequence of a kink solution  interpolating between {{\it maxima} of the potential.     For a given value of $q_0$ the walls can be classified   according to the choice of $h_i$  into the following classes  (the notations are chosen to be  compatible  with earlier classifications \cite{{CGI,BC} of extreme wall ($q_0=0$) solutions): \begin{{itemize} \item Type I walls:  a special case  of Type II walls with $\Lambda_2=0$, and $q_0=0$.  %and $h_1=1. \item Type II  walls:  positive-tension walls with  $h_1=-h_2=1$. \item   Type III  walls: positive-tension walls with $h_1=h_2=1$. \item Type III$'$ walls: negative-tension walls with $h_1=h_2=-1$, and $\sigma_{{III'}=-\sigma_{{III}$. \item Type IV walls: negative-tension walls with $h_1=-h_2=-1$, and $\sigma_{{IV}=-\sigma_{{II}$.  \item Type V walls:  a special case of  of Type IV walls with $\Lambda_2=0$, $q_0=0$, and    $\sigma_{{V}=-\sigma_{{I}$. \end{{itemize}      The global and local space-times of positive tension walls with $q_0=0$  (and $S_0=1$) as well as   $q_0>0$    (and $S_+=\cosh(\beta t)$)  were extensively studied in \cite{{CGSII}. In \cite{{CGSII},  the $q_0<0$  ($S(t)=\cos(\beta t)$) examples were not further  studied, in part due to the geodesic incompleteness of the space-time description of the AdS$_2$ space-time transverse to the wall. Nevertheless, these are proper local solutions  deserving further study (see also  \cite{{170}). On the other hand  the negative tension walls are of interest    in the study of AdS/CFT correspondence and thus deserve further  investigation.  %(The extreme cases with $q_0=0$ and $S_0=1$  %were classified in \cite{{BC}.)   In the following Section we provide a systematic classification of the  (local and global) space-time structure of the possible domain wall  solutions.      \section{{Classification of the domain wall solutions} \label{{classification}  We shall  classify the solutions according to the   values of the parameter $q_{{0}$. The metric, intrinsic to the wall and specified by $S(t)$ is locally related to standard coordinates of M$_{{D-1}$, AdS$_{{D-1}$, or dS$_{{D-1}$ space-times for $q_0=0$, $q_0>0$ or $q_0<0$, respectively. Within each class we then discuss the space-time  structure transverse  to the wall as determined by the metric conformal factor $A(z)$; its structure is governed by the energy density (\ref{{gensig}) and its relationship to the cosmological constants on either side of the wall.   \subsection{{Walls with $(q_{{0}=0)$: extreme walls }  The $q_{{0}=0$ solutions, known as extreme domain walls~\cite{{CDGS}, exist for $\Lambda_{{1,2}\le 0$.   (The cosmological constant is defined as  %\begin{{equation} $\Lambda_{{1,2}\equiv  -(D-3)(D-1)\alpha_{{1,2}^{{2}$.) % in this case, since only AdS$_{{D}$ amd M$_{{D}$ space are relevant.) %\end{{equation}  Since the wall is homogeneous, isotropic and boost invariant, the spatial curvature of constant $z$ sections is not unambiguously defined;  there is no preferred frame in the (D-1)-dimensional space-time of the wall.  The two $S_{{0}$ solutions (\ref{{snull})---the Milne type solution with $S=\beta t$ and $k=-\beta^2$ and the inertial Minkowski solution with $S=1$ and $k=0$--- both describe M$_{{D-1}$ space-time. The two solutions  are related by a coordinate transformation \cite{{Robertson}  that does not involve the transverse coordinate $z$ and therefore describe locally equivalent space-times.   The $S=1$ solution is the {{\em only\/} wall which represents a noncompact {{\em planar\/} ($k=0$) and static wall. These walls  could be  realized as supersymmetric bosonic configurations. Examples of  supersymmetric domain walls in D=4 $N=1$ supergravity coupled to chiral matter superfields were first found and  studied in~\cite{{CGRI},  and recent examples within D=5   gauged supergravities  were given in \cite{{BC}.  The  physically distinct solutions  (with $S(t)=1$) correspond  to   two sets of solutions for $A(z)$ in Eq.\ (\ref{{anull}),  with the   asymptotic $D$-dimensional anti-deSitter ($AdS_D$) and Minkowski ($M_D$)  space-times described by  {{\em horo-spherical\/}  and Cartesian  coordinates, respectively.  Positive energy solutions can be classified as the following  three types \cite{{CGI}, according to the relationship of  the energy density of the wall $\sigma$  to $\alpha_{{1,2}$:  \begin{{itemize} \item Type I:  planar walls with  $\kappa_D\sigma_{{ext,I}=2\alpha_1$,  interpolate between M$_{{D}$ and AdS$_{{D}$ where on the latter side  the metric  conformal factor $A(z)$ decreases  and reaches Cauchy horizon at $z\to  -\infty$. These walls saturate  a $D$-dimensional analog of the  Coleman-deLuccia \cite{{CD}  bound. \item Type II: planar walls  with  $\kappa_D\sigma_{{ext,II}=2(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)$ interpolate between two AdS$_{{D}$ regions, in which  $A(z)$ decreases (repulsive gravity)  away from either side of  the wall. (The special case with a $Z_2$-symmetry ($\alpha_1=\alpha_2$)  in D=5 gives rise to the Randall-Sundrum scenario with one positive   tension brane\cite{{070}.)    $z=\pm\infty$ correspond to  the Cauchy AdS horizons.  The geodesic extensions  were studied extensively in  \cite{{CDGS,Gibb,CGSII} and bear striking similarities to the global  space-times of extreme charged black holes. \item  Type III: planar walls  with $\kappa_D\sigma_{{ext,III}=2(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)$ interpolate between two AdS$_{{D}$ spaces with different cosmological constants; the conformal factor goes to infinity on $z>0$ side of the wall,  while decreases on the other side.   The singularity in $A(z)$ at a finite value of $z$  represents the time-like boundary of the  AdS$_{{D}$ space-time.

(Those are typical wall solutions encountered in gauged supergravity  theories (see, e.g., \cite{{BC}), and are of interest in the study of RGE flows in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.)   \item Type V: planar walls with  $\sigma_{{ext,V}=-2\alpha_1$, interpolating between M$_{{D}$ and AdS$_{{D}$; on the AdS side  $A(z)$ increases away from the wall, approaching the boundary of the AdS at a finite value of $z$.  \end{{itemize}  The behavior of the conformal factor $A(z)$ for each class of solutions  can be easily seen from specific examples shown in Fig.1.    Type I-V, Type II-IV and Type III-III$'$ can be viewed as ``dual''.  Namely,  the    energy density of these walls have opposite signs  and the     space-time patches of the  AdS$_{{D}$  are complementary, i.e.,  AdS Cauchy    horizons in one case are replaced by the boundaries of AdS  space-times in another and  vice  versa.   Note  that in this sense the  extreme  Type II walls, which   provide a realization of the Randall-Sundrum scenario in D=5,  and Type IV  walls,  which are generically encountered in  the study of AdS/CFT correspondence, provide the {{\it complementary} domains of the  AdS space-time.  We also note that within field-theoretic framework,  such as gauged supergravity theories, a  realization of  (finite) negative tension domain walls and  the  issues of their stability require further study.  \subsection{{Walls  with $q_{{0}>0$}  $q_{{0}=\beta^2$ solutions with    the form of $S_{{+}$ in Eq. (\ref{{splus}) describe  (D-1)-dimensional de~Sitter space-time (dS$_{{D-1}$) parallel to the wall. The topology of dS$_{{D-1}$ is  ${{\bf R}({{\text{{time}})\times {{\bf S}^{{D-2}({{\text{{space}})$. dS$_{{D-1}$ represents a hyperboloid embedded in a flat D-dimensional Minkowski space-time \cite{{Gibb}, and the three possible spatial curvatures $(k=-\beta^2,~0,~\beta^2)$  correspond to three different choices of constant time slices of this hyperboloid. However, only the positive curvature solution with $S(t)=\cosh (\beta t)$  yields the complete covering of dS$_{{D-1}$ \cite{{Gibb,CGSII}; we  will mainly focus on this class of solutions, which  have a topology of the   {{\it ``expanding bubbles''}. A possible way to   create  such expanding bubbles is via instantons of  Euclidean  gravity.  %There are three distinctive solutions (\ref{{aplus}) for $A(z)$  %corresponding to positive, zero and negative cosmological constants.   The walls can be classified according to their energy density (\ref{{gensig}) into the following classes: \begin{{itemize} \item Type II walls with \begin{{equation} \kappa_D\sigma_{{{{non, II}}=2\left(\pm\alpha^2_{{1}+\beta^2\right)^{{1/2}+ 2\left(\pm\alpha^2_{{2}+\beta^2\right)^{{1/2}\ge \kappa_D \sigma_{{ext,II}. \label{{nex} \end{{equation} are non-extreme, i.e. their energy density is above that of their extreme counterparts.  Here  %the subscript $+$ refers to $q_0>0$ and  $\Lambda_{{i}\equiv \mp(D-3)(D-1)\alpha_{{i}^2$.  Note that the domain walls in this class involve positive, zero and negative cosmological constants,  and the minus sign in front of $\alpha_i^2$ corresponds to a  {{\em positive\/} $\Lambda_i$. Further more, in the de~Sitter case, $\alpha^{{2}_{{i} \leq \beta^{{2}$ is required. There are $6$ possible  configurations of Type II wall interpolating between different  space-times, which are shown as $6$ examples in Fig. 2.    Configurations with geodesically complete space-time internal to the wall ($S(t)=\cosh(\beta t)$) describe {{\it expanding bubbles with two insides}.\cite{{CGSII}. Namely, because   the radius  $R_b$ of the curvature of concentric shells at distance $z$  is  proportional to $A^{{1/2}(z)S(t)$, $R_b$, at fixed $t$,   decreases as $A(z)$ decreases with increasing $|z|$,  and therefore    either side of the wall corresponds to an {{\it inside} region of the bubble.  In addition,    since $S(t)$ increases with $t$, the bubble is  {{\it expanding}     to an asymptotic observer on either side of the wall.    (One possible origin of a creation of such configurations    is via instantons of Euclidean gravity-quantum cosmology \cite{{QuantumCosmology}).    Since $A(z)$  decreases with increasing $|z|$, gravity is repulsive   on either side of the wall and    $z \rightarrow \pm \infty$ corresponds to  (cosmological) horizons.  The geodesic extensions are  studied  in  \cite{{CGSII}, and bear striking similarities to non-extreme charged black holes where time-like singularities are replaced by wall boundaries.    The walls with $\Lambda_{{1,2}\le 0$ are generalizations  of the extreme Type II and Type I walls with $\beta=0$ to $\beta >0$.     The walls with $\Lambda_{{1}$ or $\Lambda_{{2}>0$ and  $\Lambda_1=\Lambda_2=0$ do not have an   extreme limit ($\beta\to 0$).  The latter class of  $M_D-M_D$ Type II domain walls in D=4  (and $S(t)=e^{{\beta t}$) was   studied  in \cite{{Vilenkin}.  dS-dS Type II walls  are unstable, since false vacuum decay walls (dS-dS Type  III walls)  are dynamically preferred \cite{{SATO,BKT}, except for the case of  $\Lambda_1=\Lambda_2>0$.    \item  Type III walls with $q_0>0$ have  an energy density lower than that  of their  extreme wall counterparts:  \begin{{equation} \kappa_D\sigma_{{{{ultra,III}}=2\left(\pm\alpha^2_{{1}+\beta^2\right)^{{1/2}- 2\left(\pm\alpha^2_{{2}+\beta^2\right)^{{1/2}\le \kappa_D \sigma_{{ext,III}, \label{{uex} \end{{equation} and are referred to as ultra-extreme domain walls.  The solutions with asymptotic $dS_{{D}$ space-times require   $\alpha^{{2}_{{i} \leq \beta^{{2}$, and consequently  they  do not have an extreme limit. Specific examples of $5$ possible configurations of the Type III  walls are shown in Fig.3.  Configurations (with $S(t)=\cosh(\beta t)$) are {{\it false vacuum decay bubbles} \cite{{Coleman,BKT}.   Namely,  the radius  $R_b \propto A^{{1/2}(z)S(t)$ decreases  (increases) for $z<0$ ($z>0$), and thus   corresponds to the  {{\it inside}  ({{\it outside}) region the bubble.  The solutions which only involve M$_{{D}$ or AdS$_{{D}$, are  more like ordinary bubbles compared with the Type II walls because    as $t$ increases the expanding bubble eventually sweeps  out the space-time on the $z>0$ side.   On the other hand, on the de Sitter side of the wall,  the metric function turns around at point $z_{{crit}$ and decreases beyond $z_{{crit}$. Hence, beyond $z_{{crit}$, the inside of the bubble  becomes an outside. $z\to \infty$ corresponds to cosmological horizons that  can be reached by  test particles with energy larger than E$_{{crit}$. In D=4 the non-negative cosmological constant domain walls of this type were extensively studied    in \cite{{SATO,BKT}.    $D=4$ false vacuum decay bubbles  with non-positive cosmological constants were studied in \cite{{CD,CGSII}. The inside of the bubble ($z\le 0$)  has the same space-time structure (with cosmological horizons at $z\to -\infty$),  just as  the Type II  non-extreme walls ($q_0>0$).  The outside ($z\ge 0$) of the bubble   has no horizons and on the M$_{{D}$ side of the wall $z\to \infty$  corresponds to the boundary of the space-time, while on the AdS side the  affine boundary is at some finite value of $z$.    \item Type III$'$  have the energy density: $\sigma_{{non,III'}=-\sigma_{{ultra,III}\ge \sigma_{{III,ext}$, which is above   the corresponding  extreme ($q_0=0$) counterparts.  Their space-time is also {{\it complementary} to that of the  Type III walls (see Fig.3).  These are ``false vacuum decay bubbles'' with the {{\it larger} cosmological constant side ($z\ge 0$) sweeping out the vacuum with the smaller cosmological  constant ($z\le 0$), in most of the cases, except the dS-dS  wall as shown in Fig.(3e). In the latter case, the metric function $A(z)$  becomes a decreasing function of $z$ for $z<z_{{crit}$ such that the inside of  the bubble becomes an outside, and  $z\to -\infty$ is a cosmological horizon.     These configurations resemble the dynamics of   an ``up-side down world'' and an actual realization of such  negative tension configurations  within a field  theoretical framework is needed.     \item Type IV walls with $\sigma_{{ultra,IV}=-\sigma_{{non,II} \le \sigma_{{ext,IV}$  are ultra-extreme negative tension   ``{{\it expanding bubbles with two  outsides}''. For non-positive cosmological constants this is the  ``apocalypse world'' where on either side of the wall an asymptotic observer will be eventually  hit by  the bubble.  Namely,   the      conformal  factor $A(z)$ increases on either side of the wall reaching the boundary of the space-time, which is $z= \pm \infty$ for   M$_{{D}$ or a finite value of $z$ for AdS$_{{D}$,  thus either side  corresponds to the outside of the wall. Since  $S(t)$  grows  with $t$, these are expanding bubbles which always hit an asymptotic observer.  \end{{itemize}   \begin{{figure} \centerline{{ \hbox{{ \epsfxsize=1.7truein \epsfbox[70 32 545 740]{{AdSAdS124.ps} \hskip 0.25truein \epsfxsize=1.7truein \epsfbox[70 32 545 740]{{AdSM124.ps} } } \vskip 0.1truein \centerline{{ \hbox{{ \epsfxsize=1.7truein %\epsfbox[55 32 525 706]{{m2.ps} \epsfbox[70 32 545 740]{{MM124.ps} \hskip 0.25truein \epsfxsize=1.7truein \epsfbox[70 32 545 740]{{AdSdS124.ps} } } \vskip 0.1truein \centerline{{ \hbox{{ \epsfxsize=1.7truein %\epsfbox[55 32 525 706]{{m2.ps} \epsfbox[70 32 545 740]{{MdS124.ps} \hskip 0.25truein \epsfxsize=1.7truein \epsfbox[70 32 545 740]{{dSdS124.ps} } } \caption{{ The metric function $A(z)$ of Type II and Type IV walls in the case of ($q_0>0$).

Note that with $S_{{-}(t)=\cos{{(\beta t)}$ (Eq.(\ref{{smin})),  the region $-{{\pi\over 2 \beta}\le t \le  {{\pi\over 2 \beta}$ describes  only a patch of  the AdS$_{{D-1}$ space-time, and  $t=\pm{{\pi\over 2 \beta}$   corresponds to an  apparent coordinate singularity (see e.g., \cite{{HE}). Also, since the radius of the curvature transverse to the wall $R_b\propto |S(t)|$, the wall is expanding for $-{{\pi\over {{2\beta}}\le t\le 0$ and then shrinking for $0\le  t\le {{\pi\over {{2\beta}}$.    These walls   could be viewed as a generalization of their   extreme  counterparts (with $q_0=\beta=0$) to $q_{{0}<0$. They can also be viewed as     an analytic continuation of AdS-AdS domain walls with $q_0= \beta ^2>0$ to  imaginary $\beta$. In this sense the AdS-AdS  walls with $q_0>0$ and $q_0<0$ are ``dual'' to each other,  and extreme AdS-AdS walls with $q_0=0$ provide a dividing line between the two classes of solutions.    The walls with $q_0<0$ can be classified  according to their energy   densities relative to their extreme counterparts as: \begin{{itemize} \item  Type II  walls  are ultra-extreme walls with $ %\begin{{equation} \kappa_D \sigma_{{ultra,II} =   2( \alpha_{{1}^2 - \beta^2)^{{1/2} + 2( \alpha_{{2}^2 -  \beta^2)^{{1/2}\le \kappa_{{D}\sigma_{{ext,II}$.   The space-time transverse to either side of  the wall has repulsive gravity near the wall, i.e. $A(z)$ decreases away from the wall until  the critical point $\beta z_{{crit}+ \vartheta_{{\pm} \equiv 0$.  Beyond $z_{{crit}$, $A(z)$ increases with increasing $|z|$,  reaching the affine boundary of the AdS space at  $\beta z + \vartheta_{{\pm} =\frac{{\pi}{{2}$.  Therefore, these walls exhibit  repulsive gravity  only  in the region close to the wall.  Eventually, geodesics cross into  a region of attractive gravity, with only null geodesics reaching the AdS boundary.  Interestingly, there are  no cosmological horizons. (Note the conformal factor $A(z)$ has  a complementary behavior relative to that of $q_0>0$ dS-dS wall.)  \item  Type III walls  are non-extreme  walls with %begin{{equation} $\kappa_D \sigma_{{non,III} = 2( \alpha_{{1}^2 - \beta^2)^{{1/2} -  2( \alpha_{{2}^2 - \beta^2)^{{1/2}\ge \sigma_{{ext,III}.$  On the $z<0$ side the gravity is again first attractive and then repulsive,   the point $\beta z +\vartheta_{{+}=-{{\pi\over 2}$ corresponding  to the AdS boundary. On the other hand, on the $z>0$ side of the wall, gravity is attractive     with  the AdS  boundary taking place at $\beta z+\vartheta_{{-}={{\pi\over 2}$.  \item Type III$'$ walls are ultra-extreme walls  with    $\kappa_D \sigma_{{ultra,III'} = -2( \alpha_{{1}^2 - \beta^2)^{{1/2} +  2( \alpha_{{2}^2 - \beta^2)^{{1/2}\le \kappa_{{D} \sigma_{{ext,III'}$.   Its space-time structure in the transverse direction  is a mirror image of the Type III $q_{{0}<0$ walls.   \item   Type IV walls are ultra-extreme walls with   $\kappa_D \sigma_{{non,IV} =  -2( \alpha_{{1}^2 - \beta^2)^{{1/2} - 2( \alpha_{{2}^2 -  \beta^2)^{{1/2}\ge \kappa_{{D} \sigma_{{ext,IV}$, with   attractive gravity  on either-side of the wall until     $\beta z+\vartheta_{{\pm}= \pm {{\pi \over 2}$, the     the AdS boundary.  \end{{itemize}   It would be very interesting to investigate further the global space-time  properties of  these configurations, the issues of their dynamic stability,  as well   as their field theoretic  embedding.   \begin{{figure} \centerline{{ \hbox{{ \epsfxsize=1.7truein \epsfbox[70 32 545 740]{{AdSAdSN124.ps} \hskip 0.25truein \epsfxsize=1.7truein \epsfbox[70 32 545 740]{{AdSAdSN133.ps} } } \caption{{ The metric function $A(z)$ of Type II-IV and Type III-III' walls in the case of ($q_0<0$).

We have  shown that the  homogeneity and isotropy of the space-time intrinsic  to the wall strongly  constrains the nature of the space-time (both intrinsic and transverse to  the well) and that this space-time structure is universal  for all D-dimensions. The analysis also  revealed  an inherent  connection between the global and local space-time structure  of  the wall  and the value of the wall tension  relative to the  cosmological constants on either side of the wall.    The solutions fall into three classes according to the value of  the  ``non-extremality parameter'' $q_0$: ${{q_0}=0$, ${{q_0}>0$,  and   $q_0<0$. Within each class,  depending on  whether  gravity is repulsive or attractive near either side of the wall,  the walls can have positive tension solutions  (Type I, II, III walls) and negative tension solutions  (Type III$'$, IV, V walls) whose space-times transverse to the wall display    complementary  properties. In this sense Type I-V, II-IV and III-III$'$  walls  can be viewed as dual.  (In particular, Type II walls provide a set-up for Randall-Sundrum scenario  in D=5 with  repulsive gravity  on either side of the wall.)    $q_0=0$ solutions are planar, static configurations. The precise tuning of their energy-density to cancel the value of cosmological constant is  ensured by  supersymmetry.  Such walls exist only for non-positive cosmological constants.   Solutions with  positive non-extremality parameter (${{q_0}=\beta^2>0$)  are  expanding ``bubbles'' with  the space-time internal to the wall  corresponding to the  expanding de~Sitter (dS$_{{D-1}$)  FLRW universe. In particular,    Type II walls are  expanding bubbles with {{\it two insides} and  thus ``safe walls'',  Type III and III$'$ walls  are bubbles with {{\it one inside and one outside} and which sweep out one side of the wall through ``false-vacuum'' decay,  while Type IV walls  are expanding bubbles with  {{\it two outsides} and thus sweep out the vacuum on either side  of the wall. These solutions exist both for positive and negative values of the cosmological constants.  Solutions with $q_0 =-\beta^2<0$ describe  an anti-deSitter (AdS$_{{D-1}$) FRWL universe internal to  the wall. However, the  coordinates describe  only a patch of the AdS space-time with the coordinate singularities  at $t=\pm {{\pi\over {{2\beta}}$. These walls have solutions only for the  negative values of  cosmological constants, and do not have  cosmological horizons in directions transverse to the wall. (Their energy density is complementary to that of  walls with $q_0>0$.)   Further investigations of the geodesics extensions and their global structure  is needed.  While the work provides a classification of  vacuum domain wall space-times, we did not address in detail the dynamic issues  such as their stability  or the  nature of their creation, nor did we  elaborate on a field-theoretic embedding of such domain walls. Let us mention again  that AdS-AdS Type II  walls with $q_0>0$ may  be realized via quantum cosmology  \cite{{QuantumCosmology}  and that Type III walls are Euclidean  bounce solutions of false-vacuum  decay bubbles. As for field-theoretic realization,  positive tension extreme  walls could be realized as bosonic  configurations in supersymmetric theories, corresponding to a  kink solution  interpolating between two supersymmetric minima.  However, it is expected  that negative tension walls  are unstable due to the appearance of   a ghost mode.~\footnote{{We would  like to  thank R. Sundrum for a discussion on this point.}   The gauged supergravity solutions tend to provide a frame-work for  negative  tension extreme wall solutions, i.e. the kink solution interpolates between   {{\it supersymmetric maxima}.  This  issue requires further study and it may have a resolution  in the string theory context (see also, e.g,   \cite{{deBVV}).        The domain wall solutions studied in this paper can  be   stacked-up   in the transverse $z$-direction,   thus provide a solution for an array of parallel walls.    %stacked-up   in a direction $z$-transverse to the % wall,  and thus  provide  an array of solutions  in a direction $z$ % transverse to the wall   In particular, if  D-dimensional space-time has  possible vacuum solutions with  cosmological constants   $\Lambda_{{1,2,\cdots n}$,  then one can superimpose  in $z$ direction   different types of domain walls interpolating between these vacua; this  may  yield interesting  possibilities with   phenomenological implications.  However, the field-theoretic embedding of  such multi-wall set-ups  may be difficult; the multi-kink solutions are  supposed to interpolate continuously between (isolated) extrema of the potential and the desired solution may not exist.  Let us consider specific examples with static (extreme) walls in D=5. Extreme Type II walls provide a set-up for Randall-Sundrum scenario with one positive tension brane in D=5 with repulsive gravity   on either side of the wall \cite{{070}.   The scenario with one positive tension brane and one negative tension  brane   \cite{{050}, can be realized as a special ($Z_2$-symmetric)   periodic array of Type II and Type IV extreme wall.  On the other hand, the realization of such an array within field theory  may     be hard to realize  and  it should clearly involve more than one scalar. The example of \cite{{240} is  a superposition of Type II  and Type III wall.  It could be realized with a scalar field  that  interpolates between two supersymmetric AdS   %(negative cosmological constant)-they are minima with large enough potential  barrier which yields Type II wall ($\kappa_D\sigma=\alpha_1+\alpha_2$), and the third deeper minimum with a potential barrier insufficiently  large  yields Type III wall ($\kappa_D\sigma =\alpha_3-\alpha_2$).    (Note  however, that in spite of its positive energy-density the    Type III walls are inherently unstable; for nonzero extremality parameter    $q_0>0$ they turn into false vacuum decay     bubbles, sweeping out the space  on one side of this wall.)   Another interesting possibility is a superposition of the two  extreme   Type I walls \cite{{Wangetal}, which can  be realized  via a single  kink and  anti-kink   that interpolate between anti-deSitter       and  Minkowski  supersymmetric minima.      The non-static Type II walls in AdS$_5$ both in the case of $q_0>0$ and  $q_0<0$ are those studied in \cite{{170,Kraus,Sasaki,Garriga}.  Another intriguing possibility may be a superposition  of these solutions with  $q_0>0$ (or $q_0<0$), where the conformal factors  can again be matched from one wall to another. Note however, the  non-static nature of these solutions may involve pathologies of  space-times such as bubbles of false vacuum decays, and  require further     investigations.        We would like to conclude with a few  remarks  regarding the    nature of the  non-extremality parameter $q_0=\beta^2>0$      within cosmological context.  (For related ideas  implemented in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, see \cite{{Gubser}.)      Extreme domain walls ($q_0=0$) are static due to the      ``miracle of supersymmetry''.  Thus,  in a cosmological context,      at zero temperature ($T=0$), domain walls between supersymmetric      vacua remain static. On the other hand, at finite temperature $T>0$,      supersymmetry is broken,  and  thus the domain      walls  are those with non-zero $q_0=\beta^2$. Namely temperature corrections to the scalar corrections are $\propto T^2$, thus modifying the energy density of the wall $\sigma=\sigma_{{ext}+{{\cal O}(T^2)$.  Clearly, since the leading corrections to $\sigma$ are of ${{\cal O}(q_0=\beta^2)$ the result implies that $q_0\propto T^2$ (or $\beta\propto T$).      In particular,  the  static extreme Type II  [Type III] domain wall  (at $T=0$)       becomes  a non-extreme Type II [Type III] solution (at $T>0$)         which is the expanding de-Sitter FLRW bubble with       two  [one] insides. Thus the  positive cosmological constant        intrinsic to the wall as well       as the rate of expansion of the bubble  are        proportional to $\beta\propto T$.       Thus as the universe cools the  expansion rate and the        cosmological constant on the wall  decrease.     \section*{{Acknowledgments}  This work was supported in part by U.S.\ Department of Energy Grant No.~DOE-EY-76-02-3071 (M.C.),  No.~DE-AC02-76CH03000 (J.W.) and   in part by the University   of Pennsylvania Research Foundation award (M.C.).

I discuss how these arise and show how they are manifested as clouds of massless fields surrounding massive monopoles. The dynamics of these clouds is discussed, and the scattering of massless monopole clouds and massive monopoles is described. \end{{abstract}  \section{{Introduction}  A quarter century ago 't Hooft and Polyakov showed \cite{{thooft} that magnetic mono\-poles could arise as topologically stable classical solutions in certain spontaneously broken gauge theories.  The fact that these included all grand unified theories led to a considerable theoretical effort to study the detailed properties and the astrophysical and cosmological implications of these GUT monopoles, as well as to a number of experimental searches.  However, the failure of these searches to detect any monopoles, together with astrophysical arguments that place stringent bounds on the monopole flux at the Earth's surface, has quite understandably led to a decreased interest from the phenomenological point of view.  Nevertheless, these monopole solutions remain valuable as tools for probing the properties of quantum field theory.  In particular, the properties of monopoles in the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit \cite{{bps} has led to the conjecture \cite{{montonen} that the electric-magnetic duality of Maxwell's equations might find a quantum field theoretic generalization that exchanges magnetically charged solitons with electrically charged elementary particles.  The prime candidate \cite{{osborn}  for this is $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.  In the case of SU(2) broken to U(1), the spectrum of massive particles is invariant under the simultaneous interchange of weak and strong coupling  and of electric and magnetic charges.  This result generalizes fairly easily to larger gauge groups, as long as the subgroup that remains unbroken is Abelian.  However, if the unbroken subgroup is Abelian, the elementary particle sector contains massless particles with electric-type charge (the ``gluons'' and their superpartners).  Duality would then require the existence of massless magnetically charged particles.  However, one can easily show that these theories have no massless classical soliton solutions.  In this talk, I will argue that, nevertheless, one can find evidence for the required massless monopoles by studying the dynamics of the massive monopoles.     \section{{BPS monopoles in SU(2) and larger groups}  Throughout this talk I will work in the BPS limit, with monopoles obeying  \begin{{equation}     B_i = D_i\Phi  \, . \label{{bpseq} \end{{equation} While this limit can be obtained by taking a limit of coupling constants, it is most naturally understood in the context of Yang-Mills theory with extended supersymmetry, where Eq.~(\ref{{bpseq}) is equivalent at the classical level to requiring that the soliton preserve half of the supersymmetry.\footnote{{Although I have $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills in mind, the only feature of this theory that I will use explicitly is the fact that the Higgs field is in the adjoint representation.  Note also that there is no confinement in this theory, even if there is an unbroken non-Abelian subgroup.}  This ensures that the BPS mass formula \begin{{equation}     M = Q_M v =  \int dS_i {{\rm Tr}\, B_i\Phi  \label{{bpsmass} \end{{equation} is preserved by quantum corrections.   One important feature of the BPS limit is that the Higgs scalar becomes massless and so can mediate a long-range attractive force between two monopoles.  It turns out that this can exactly balance the magnetic repulsion between static monopoles, thus allowing static multimonopole solutions to exist.  In fact, for the case of SU(2) broken to U(1),  all higher charged BPS solutions can be understood as multimonopole solutions of this sort.  Not only does a solution with $n$ units of magnetic charge have $n$ times the mass of the unit monopole, but index theory methods show \cite{{su2index} that the number collective coordinates needed to quantize the solution is precisely $4n$, corresponding to a three-dimensional position and a U(1) phase for each of the $n$ constituent monopoles; excitation of these phase coordinates gives independent dyonic electric charges to the individual monopoles.  In order to have the possibility of symmetry breaking to a non-Abelian subgroup, we must start with a gauge group of rank $r \ge 2$.  The generators of this gauge group can be chosen to be a set of $r$ commuting $H_i$ that form a basis for the Cartan subalgebra, together with a set of raising and lowering operators associated with the roots $\balpha$.  The asymptotic adjoint Higgs field in some fixed direction can always be brought into the form \begin{{equation}       \Phi_0 = {{\bf h} \cdot {{\bf H}  \, . \end{{equation} If the $r$-component vector $\bf h$ has nonzero inner products with all of the roots, then the gauge symmetry is broken maximally, to U(1)$^r$; if not, then the roots orthogonal to $\bf h$ yield the root diagram of an unbroken non-Abelian group $K$.  The long range part of the magnetic field must lie in the unbroken part of the gauge group.  Hence, in the direction used to define $\Phi_0$, the leading part of asymptotic magnetic field can also be brought into the Cartan subalgebra and written in the form \begin{{equation}       B_i = {{\bf g} \cdot {{\bf H} {{{{\hat r}_i\over r^2}  \, . \end{{equation}  In the case of maximal symmetry breaking there are $r$ topological charges, one for each of the unbroken U(1) factors.  The connection between these and the magnetic charge is most easily seen by choosing a set of $r$ simple roots $\bbeta_a$. These form a basis for the root lattice of the Lie group with the property that any root can be written as a linear combination of simple roots with coefficients all of the same sign.  There are many possible choices for the simple roots, but the vector $\bf h$ associated with the Higgs field can be used to pick out a unique set satisfying ${{\bf h} \cdot {{\bbeta_a} > 0$.  The topological quantization condition \cite{{quantization} then takes the form \begin{{equation}       {{\bf g} = {{4\pi\over e} \sum_a n_a {{\bbeta_a \over \bbeta_a^2}  \label{{gdef} \end{{equation} where the integers $n_a$ are the topological charges.  The BPS mass formula, Eq.~(\ref{{bpsmass}), can be written as  \begin{{equation}       M = {{\bf g}\cdot {{\bf h}       = \sum_a n_a \left( {{4\pi\over e} {{\bf h} \cdot \bbeta_a  \right)      \equiv \sum_a n_a m_a  \, , \label{{msbmass} \end{{equation}  while the number of collective coordinates is \cite{{Gindex} \begin{{equation}    {{\cal N}= 4\sum_a n_a  \, . \label{{msbindex} \end{{equation}    These results suggest that, just as in the SU(2) case, all higher charged solutions should be viewed as multimonopole configurations. Now, however, there are $r$ species of fundamental monopoles, one for each U(1) factor, with the $a$th species having mass $m_a$, topological charges $n_b=\delta_{{ab}$, and four degrees of freedom (three for center-of-mass motion and one U(1) phase).  These fundamental monopoles can be explicitly obtained by embedding the SU(2) unit monopole in the SU(2) subgroups defined by the various $\bbeta_a$.   When the symmetry breaking is nonmaximal, to $K \times {{\rm U(1)}^{{r-k}$, some of the simple roots, which I denote by $\bgamma_i$, are orthogonal to $\bf h$ and form a complete set of simple roots for $K$.  The remainder, denoted $\tilde \bbeta_a$, can required, as before, to obey ${{\bf h} \cdot {{\tilde\bbeta_a} > 0$. Equation~(\ref{{gdef}) is replaced by \begin{{equation}       {{\bf g} = {{4\pi\over e} \sum_a \tilde n_a {{\tilde \bbeta_a                \over \tilde \bbeta_a^2}            + \sum_i q_i{{\bgamma_j \over \bgamma_j^2}  \, . \label{{NUSgdef} \end{{equation} The $\tilde n_a$ and $q_i$ are integers, with the former being the conserved topological charges.\footnote{{In contrast with the maximally broken case, the simple roots are not uniquely determined by the requirement that their inner product with $\bf h$ be positive.  The various allowed sets are related by gauge transformations of the unbroken group.  The $\tilde n_a$ are invariant under these transformations, but the $q_i$ are not.}    In general, the corresponding magnetic field has both Abelian and non-Abelian components.  In order to avoid certain pathologies \cite{{pathologies} associated with non-Abelian magnetic charges, I will assume for the remainder of this talk that ${{\bf g} \cdot \bgamma_i =$ for all $i$, so that the long-range magnetic field is purely Abelian.  (There is little loss of generality in this assumption since, given a configuration with nonzero ${{\bf g} \cdot \bgamma_i$, the additional monopoles needed to cancel the non-Abelian part of the total magnetic charge can be placed at an arbitrarily large distance.)  With this assumption, Eqs.~(\ref{{msbmass}) and (\ref{{msbindex}) are replaced by \begin{{equation}       M =  \sum_a \tilde n_a m_a  \end{{equation}  and \cite{{nonabelindex} \begin{{equation}    {{\cal N}=  4\sum_a\tilde n_a + 4 \sum_i q_i \, . \end{{equation}   Analogy with the maximally broken case would then suggest that there is one fundamental monopole, with mass $m_a$ and four degrees of freedom, associated each of the $\tilde\bbeta_a$, and one massless monopole, also with four degrees of freedom, associated with each of the $\bgamma_i$.  Indeed, the embedding construction for the massive fundamental monopoles goes through pretty much as before.  The massless monopoles, on the other hand, cannot be constructed in this manner: applying the embedding construction to the SU(2) subgroup corresponding to one of the $\bgamma_i$ simply yields a pure vacuum solution.  In fact, it is easy to show that there are no localized classical solutions with zero energy.  \section{{Low energy monopole dynamics}  Although we cannot obtain classical solutions corresponding to isolated massless monopoles, one can find evidence of these monopoles in the dynamics of multimonopole systems.  The moduli space approximation \cite{{msa} is a convenient tool for studying such systems at low energy.  The essential idea is to approximate solutions with slowly moving monopoles\footnote{{These includes dyons with small electric charges, since these correspond to slowly varying U(1) phases.} as being motion on the moduli space of static BPS multimonopole solutions.  More precisely, let \{{$A_i^{{\rm BPS}({{\bf r}, z)$, $\Phi^{{\rm BPS}({{\bf r}, z)$\} be a family of gauge-inequivalent BPS solutions parameterized by a set of collective coordinates $z_a$.  In the moduli space approximation one adopts the Ansatz \begin{{eqnarray}      A_0({{\bf r},t) &=& 0 \cr       A_i({{\bf r},t) &=& U^{{-1}({{\bf r},t)  A_i^{{\rm BPS}({{\bf r},      z(t)) U({{\bf         r},t) -{{i} U^{{-1}({{\bf r},t) \partial_i U({{\bf r},t) \cr        \Phi({{\bf r},t) &=& U^{{-1}({{\bf r},t) \Phi^{{\rm BPS}({{\bf r}, z(t))       U({{\bf r},t) \, . \label{{modspaceansatz} \end{{eqnarray} With this Ansatz, the time derivatives of the fields are of the form \begin{{eqnarray}     \dot A_i &=& \dot z_j \left[{{\partial A_i \over \partial z_j} + D_i            \epsilon_j \right]  \equiv \dot z_j  \delta_j A_i  \cr     \dot \Phi &=& \dot z_j \left[{{\partial \Phi \over \partial z_j} + [\Phi,            \epsilon_j] \right]  \equiv \dot z_j  \delta_j \Phi   \, . \end{{eqnarray} The terms involving $\epsilon_j$ arise from differentiating the gauge function $U({{\bf r},t)$; they are fixed uniquely by Gauss's law, which turns out to be equivalent to imposing a background gauge condition on $\dot A_i$ and $\dot \Phi$.    Substituting this Ansatz into the Yang-Mills Lagrangian gives \begin{{equation}     L_{{MS} = {{1\over 2} \int d^3r {{\rm Tr}\left[ {{\dot A_i}^2 + {{\dot           \Phi}^2 + B_i^2 +            D_i\Phi^2 \right]     = {{1\over 2} g_{{ij}(z) \dot z_i \dot z_j  + M \label{{LMS} \end{{equation} where the static energy $M$ is constant on the moduli space and \begin{{equation}     g_{{ij}(z) = \int d^3r \left[ \delta_i A_k \delta_j A_k +          \delta_i \Phi  \delta_j \Phi  \right]  \, . \label{{metricdef} \end{{equation} If we interpret $g_{{ij}$ as a metric on the moduli space, then the solutions to $ L_{{MS}$ are simply geodesic motion on the moduli space.  In most cases, it turns out not to be practicable to use Eq.~(\ref{{metricdef}) directly to determine $g_{{ij}(z)$.  However, by using indirect methods the moduli space metrics for a number of interesting cases have been by more indirect methods. I will make use of some of these results in the next two sections.  \section{{An SO(5) example}  The simplest example where one finds evidence of massless monopoles arises with the gauge group SO(5), whose root diagram is shown in Fig.~1.  With the Higgs field vector $\bf h$ is in the direction shown on the left, the symmetry is broken to U(1)$\times$U(1).  There are two species of massive fundamental monopoles, corresponding to the simple roots $\bbeta$ and $\bgamma$.  If instead the Higgs vector is vertical, as shown on the right, the unbroken gauge group is SU(2)$\times$U(1), with the SU(2) having roots $\pm \bgamma$.  The fundamental $\bbeta$-monopole remains massive, but now $\bgamma$ corresponds to an elusive massless monopole.  I will focus on solutions with \begin{{equation}    {{\bf g} = {{4\pi\over e} \left( {{\bbeta\over \bbeta^2}          + {{\bgamma\over \bgamma^2} \right) \, . \label{{so5g} \end{{equation} In the maximally broken case, these are composed of two distinct massive fundamental monopoles, and have an eight-dimensional moduli space whose metric is \cite{{kwy} \pagebreak  \vskip 5mm \begin{{center} \leavevmode \epsfysize =2in\epsfbox{{q2000so5.eps} \end{{center} \vskip 8mm \begin{{quote} {{\bf Figure 1:} {{\small The root diagram of $SO(5)$.

With SU(2)$\times$U(1) breaking, Eq.~(\ref{{so5g}) corresponds to a combination of one massive and one massless monopole.  It turns out to be relatively straightforward to solve the field equations explicitly \cite{{so5}.  The solutions are spherically symmetric and depend on eight parameters: three position coordinates {{\bf X}, four SU(2)$\times$U(1) phase angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\chi$. and one last parameter, $a$, that can take on any real positive value and whose interpretation will become clear shortly.  The fields can be decomposed according their transformations under the unbroken SU(2). The singlet terms are just what would be obtained by embedding the unit SU(2) monopole using the composite root $2\bbeta+\bgamma$; they have no dependence on $a$.  By themselves, they would describe an object with a massive core surrounded by a simple Coulomb magnetic field.  The doublet terms fall exponentially fast outside the monopole core and are relatively uninteresting.  Finally, the triplet parts of the gauge and Higgs fields are given by invariant tensors multiplied by the function \begin{{equation}    G(r, a) = \left[{{v \over \sinh (evr)} -{{1 \over er} \right]           \left[ 1 +  {{r\over a} \coth(vr/2) \right]^{{-1}  \, . \end{{equation} For $r \la a$, the second factor on the right hand side is approximately unity, so $G$, and hence the corresponding $A_i$, falls as $1/r$.  This produces a Coulomb magnetic field in the unbroken SU(2) subgroup.  However, for $r \ga a$, the last factor gives an additional $1/r$, so the triplet part of $A_i$ falls as $1/r^2$, and the non-Abelian component of the magnetic field fall more rapidly.  Hence, we may view the solution as being composed of a massive core of radius $\sim (ev)^{{-1}$ surrounded by a ``cloud'' of non-Abelian fields of radius $\sim a$.  Inside this cloud one finds the magnetic field appropriate to a monopole with both Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic charges; i.e., the charge appropriate to an isolated massive $\bbeta$-monopole.  Outside the cloud, only the Abelian charge is evident.  Thus, the massless $\bgamma$-monopole can be viewed as a shell of radius $\sim a$ surrounding the massive monopole.  Curiously, the energy of the solution is independent of $a$, despite the fact that this parameter is not associated with any symmetry of the system.  We can proceed further and examine the moduli space metric.  Using the explicit form of the solutions and Eq.~(\ref{{gdef}), one obtains \cite{{kwynonabelian} \begin{{equation}     ds^2 = M d{{\bf X}^2 +  {{16\pi^2 \over M }d\chi^2 +         k \left[{{ da^2 \over a}        + a \left( d\alpha^2 + \sin^2\alpha d\beta^2           + (d \gamma + \cos\alpha d\beta)^2 \right) \right]   \label{{NUSmetric} \end{{equation} where $k$ is the same constant as in Eq.~(\ref{{MSBmetric}).  Now let us return for a minute to the maximally broken case and imagine approaching the SU(2)$\times$U(1) case by ``rotating'' the Higgs vector until it is vertical.  This corresponds to taking the $\bgamma$-monopole mass, and thus the reduced mass $\mu$, to zero. Taking this limit in the metric of Eq.~(\ref{{MSBmetric}) gives precisely Eq.~(\ref{{NUSmetric}), except for a curious change in notation: The monopole separation $r$ becomes the cloud parameter $a$, while the spatial angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ combine with the relative U(1) phase $\psi$ to give the SU(2) Euler angles.  \section{{A more complex system}  \def\bhyl{{\hat{{\bf y}_L} \def\bhyr{{\hat{{\bf y}_R}  An example with somewhat more structure is obtained by considering the case of ${{\rm SU}(N+2)$ broken to ${{\rm U}(1)\times{{\rm SU}(N)\times{{\rm U}(1)$, with the unbroken ${{\rm SU}(N)$ lying in the middle $N\times N$ block in a basis where the eigenvalues of the Higgs field decrease monotonically along the diagonal.  A purely Abelian asymptotic magnetic field can be obtained by setting all of the $\tilde n_j$ and $q_i$ in Eq.~(\ref{{NUSgdef}) equal to unity; i.e., by combining one each of the two species of massive and $N-1$ species of massless monopoles.  The moduli space of such solutions is $4(N+1)$-dimensional, with the collective coordinates including a position and U(1) phase for each of the massive monopoles, a number of SU($N$) orientation angles, and a single cloud parameter, $b$, that can take on any value greater than or equal to $r$, the separation between the two massive monopoles.  The solutions can be obtained explicitly \cite{{ewyi} by using the Nahm construction \cite{{nahm}.  Although their detailed structure is somewhat complex,  their behavior well outside the monopole cores is fairly simple.  The asymptotic Higgs field can be written as  \begin{{equation}     \Phi_\infty({{\bf r}) = U^{{-1}({{\bf r}) \,{{\rm diag}( v_3, v_2,       \dots, v_2,  v_1)\,  U({{\bf r})  \end{{equation} where $U({{\bf r})$ is a gauge transformation whose form will not concern us and the Higgs eigenvalues satisfy $v_3 > v_2 > v_1$.  The unbroken SU($N$) lies in the middle $N\times N$ block corresponding to the repeated eigenvalue $v_2$. The form of the magnetic field depends on how the distances $y_L$ and $y_R$ from the two massive monopoles compare to $b$.   For $y_L, y_R \ll b$, \begin{{equation}     {{\bf B}({{\bf r}) = U^{{-1}({{\bf r})     \,{{\rm diag}\left( {{\bhyr\over 2y_R^2}, -{{\bhyr\over 2y_R^2},      {{\bhyl\over 2y_L^2},       0,  \dots, 0,  -{{\bhyl\over 2y_L^2} \right)  U({{\bf r}) + \cdots \end{{equation} where the dots represent terms that fall off more rapidly with distance, while for $y \equiv (y_L +y_R)/2 \gg b$ \begin{{equation}     {{\bf B}({{\bf r}) = U^{{-1}({{\bf r})     \,{{\rm diag}\left( {{\hat{{\bf y}\over 2y^2}, 0, 0,      0,  \dots, 0,  -{{\hat{{\bf y}\over 2y^2} \right)  U({{\bf r})       + \cdots  \, , \end{{equation} Thus, at distances smaller than $b$ one sees fields corresponding to both Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic charges, but at larger distances only the Abelian component survives, just as in the SO(5) example.  It is instructive to study the scattering of the two massive monopoles in these solutions.  Because these monopoles are associated with orthogonal roots [or, equivalently, because they correspond to embeddings into commuting $2 \times 2$ blocks of the SU($N$) matrices], there is no direct interaction between them.  Instead, they must interact through the massless monopole cloud.  In the low energy limit, we can use the moduli space approximation to study this process \cite{{xchen}.  The moduli space metric for the maximally broken case with $N+1$ distinct massive fundamental monopoles is known \cite{{kwy}. The SO(5) example of the previous section suggests that this metric is still valid when $N-1$ of these monopoles become massless, although, just as in that case, the physical interpretations of the collective coordinates change in the massless limit, with the positions of the massless monopoles being transformed into gauge orientations and a single gauge invariant parameter, $b$.  The various gauge orientation and angular variables are most easily handled by expressing them in terms of the conserved charges and angular momentum.  This still leads to a fairly complicated dynamics, but matters simplify considerably if the electric-type charges in the unbroken ${{\rm U}(1)\times{{\rm SU}(N)\times{{\rm U}(1)$ all vanish.  After separating out the total center-of-mass motion, one is then left with an effective Lagrangian \begin{{equation}    L = \left[{{\mu\over 2} + {{kb \over 4(b^2-r^2)}\right] \dot r^2         + {{kb \over 4(b^2-r^2)}\dot b^2 + {{br \over b^2 -r^2}\dot b         \dot r         - {{b J^2 \over 2r^2(k+\mu b)} \label{{suNlag} \end{{equation} governing the time development of $b$ and $r$.  Here $J$ is the angular momentum, $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the massive monopoles and, as in the previous section, $k$ is a numerical constant.  Analysis of the Euler-Lagrange equations that follow from Eq.~(\ref{{suNlag}) shows that $r$ and $b$ decouple at large times. Thus, at large $|t|$ the energy of the system is approximately the sum of a massive monopole kinetic energy $E_r = \mu \dot r^2/2$ and a cloud energy $E_b =\dot b^2/4b$, with $r$ and $b$ varying asymptotically as \begin{{eqnarray}     r &\sim& v|t| + \cdots   \nonumber \\       b &\sim& ct^2 + \cdots  \label{{asymbehavior} \end{{eqnarray} with $v$ and $c$ constants.  In a typical scattering process the cloud initially decreases in size while simultaneously the two massive monopoles approach one another.  Eventually $b$ and $r$ reach their minimum values (generally not at the same time) and then begin to to increase again according to Eq.~(\ref{{asymbehavior}).  In the course of this process, energy is exchanged between the cloud and the massive monopoles, so that the final splitting between $E_r$ and $E_b$ at $t \rightarrow \infty$ is different from the initial one at $t \rightarrow -\infty$.  One surprising feature of Eq.~(\ref{{asymbehavior}) is the quadratic growth of $b$ with time.  It seems likely that this is an artifact of the moduli space approximation, and that radiation of massless gluons will have the effect of reducing this to a linear growth.  \section{{Summary and conclusion}  Electric-magnetic duality in gauge theories with the symmetry spontaneously broken to a non-Abelian subgroup requires the existence of massless magnetically charged objects that would be the duals to the electrically charged massless gauge bosons.  These massless monopoles cannot be exhibited as isolated classical soliton solutions.  However, as I have shown, their existence is manifested through clouds of non-Abelian field surrounding one or more massive monopoles.  These clouds are described by a small number of collective coordinates, which correspond to the massless monopole degrees of freedom; for static solutions, the energy is independent of the values of these parameters.  Duality suggests that these cloud parameters should have counterparts in the perturbative sector.  It would be instructive to understand more precisely what these are, and to look in perturbative sector scattering for analogies with the low-energy scattering of massive monopoles and massless monopole clouds.  Investigations in this direction would certainly lead to deeper insights into the properties of non-Abelian gauge theories.     \vskip .4cm   \noindent I would like to express my appreciation to the organizers of this conference.

Although no experimental indication exists to presuppose its  existence, it remains a useful working hypothesis in various theories.  The original Kaluza-Klein idea proposes a fifth dimension that accounts for the electromagnetic interaction in the framework of an extended general relativity, and thus has succeeded in presenting gravity and electromagnetism in a unified picture. Additional dimensions have been proposed to account for the other fundamental interactions. Indeed,  this is the underlying aim  in applications  in  supergravity and string theory, where additional compactified dimensions of space have been linked to gauge interactions. In fact, arguments based on the supersymmetry breaking scale\cite{{anto} and recent developments in string theory\cite{{Dim} have opened up the possibility that unification occurs at the electroweak scale, with the implication that the additional dimensions might be detected through its effect on gravity at millimeter scales.   Within an ampler view, the question why there are four and not any other number of physical dimensions remains unanswered. To investigate this question,  one can check whether it is possible to construct a model in which additional dimensions lead consistently to the same four-dimensional physics. %NEW  In particular,  the idea of higher dimensions should provide also for mechanisms in which an assumed larger dimensional universe transforms into the present one, with an expected explanation of the fate of other dimensions.  The most popular related assumption for this is Klein's idea of compactification, which assumes dimensions become unobservable by closing on themselves at a small length. %applications have not yet developed to the point that its tenets %can be subjected to experimental test  However, the origin, dynamics,  and    range of applicability of this process have  not been thoroughly  pursued and clarified, as will be implied from the present work. Indeed, when considering this mechanism, its existence has generally been taken for granted but not the causes leading to it.    In addition,  several   methods of dimensional reduction and compactification (see Ref.  \cite{{Bai} for a review) are known but few account successfully for the particles' spectrum, representations and, in particular, for the demand that chiral fermions be obtained to reproduce the quantum numbers of physical particles\cite{{Wit}.  Even when acceptable compactifications are found, there are multiple  choices with similar four-dimensional physics,  which points at the need of additional feasible restrictions to reduce the number of possibilities and increase the predictability. Gauge fields acting on particles is such a physical mechanism, and needs to be examined. The choice of these fields is motivated by the already known four-dimensional ones. The self-consistency of these fields should be checked in the next stage of the study of the problem. %NEW    To investigate a possible dynamical process  that generates compactification  is the main object of this work. We will explore the idea that this compactification is generated by the gauge fields themselves, which we think more economical. It is natural to start by considering the Dirac equation, which describes  basic spin-1/2 fields. Thus, the  mechanism proposed should allow for a description of the fermion fields in the presence of usual and compactifying interactions. We require that the latter should not affect the workings of the first and the Dirac fields.  It is also expected that they conserve the symmetry in the weight of positive and negative energies so that when these are turned on the vacuum should not be altered asymmetrically. It is  known that such interactions exist\cite{{Mar} and that they satisfy a restriction related to the presence of the Dirac supersymmetry\cite{{DiracSuper}.  In this paper we  investigate Dirac-supersymmetric interactions which effectively lead  to    separation into physical and compactified dimensions and we find indeed  a simple instance in which this is possible. This material is organized as follows:  In Section II we review Dirac supersymmetry which defines some of the conditions for interactions in which a dynamical dimension separation mechanism can be possible. In Section III we investigate separation of the Dirac-supersymmetric equation using as example the 3+1 dimensional case. In Section IV we consider a dimension separation mechanism in which a $U(1)$ magnetic field is assumed and which produces an effective compactification in some dimensions. This model is considered in both a 4-$d$ to 2-$d$ (1+1) and a 6-$d$ to 4-$d$ (3+1) transitions. In Section V we draw some conclusions from this work. \section{{Interactions in Dirac supersymmetry} The basic feature defining   Dirac supersymmetric interactions  is the possibility of applying a generalized Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation which brings the usual Dirac Hamiltonian to a form in which positive and negative solutions  separate with equal weight. Explicitly, we assume the initial Dirac Hamiltonian $H$ can be written in the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{DiracSup} H=Q+Q^\dagger+\lambda, \end{{eqnarray} where $\lambda$ is a Hermitian operator and $Q$ is a fermionic operator such that it and its adjoint $Q^\dagger$ satisfy ${{Q}^2=0$ and ${{Q^\dagger}^2=0$, and  also the anticommutation relations \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{anticom}  \{{ Q,\lambda \} =0\ \ \ \ \ \{{ Q^\dagger,\lambda \}=0 . \end{{eqnarray} After applying the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation (FWT) $H$ becomes\cite{{Mar} \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{FWtrans}  H^\prime= \frac{{\lambda}{{(\lambda^2)^{{1/2} }  {{(\{{Q,Q^\dagger \} +\lambda^2)}^{{1/2}. \end{{eqnarray} An extensive analysis of the interactions that take the form in Eq. (\ref{{DiracSup}) is given in Ref. \cite{{Mar}. The resulting ones are given in the Hamiltonian (in 4+1 dimensions) \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{HamDS}  H={{ \boldmathalpha}\cdot{{ \boldmathpi}+{{ \alpha}_5\pi_5+\mu\beta , \end{{eqnarray} where \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{pi} {{ \pi}_I={{  p}_I+{{\mathsf A}_I({{\bf x})+i \beta {{\mathsf E}_I({{\bf x}) \ \ \ \ I=1,2,3,5, \end{{eqnarray} ${{ \alpha}_i$ are Dirac matrices with ${{ \alpha}_i=\gamma_0\gamma^i$, ${{ \alpha}_5=i\beta\gamma_5$, ${{\mathsf A}_I({{\bf x})$ and ${{\mathsf E}_I({{\bf x})$ are external arbitrary fields, and $\mu$ is the mass constant, which multiplies the corresponding term. %se usa mathbf \section{{Separation of Dirac-supersymmetric equation}  Our main concern here is to study   dynamical compactification as a  dimensional reduction effect and, in particular, the form of those interactions which not only satisfy Dirac-supersymmetric conditions but also allow for such mechanism. Specifically, we need a mechanism in which %withoutat this point asking the mechanism behind, an interaction would confine particles in some dimensions and keep free-particle behavior in the unconfined (physical) dimensions. For this purpose we use as illustrative model the $3+1\rightarrow 1+1$ reduction case, studying separation of variables for $H$ in Eq. (\ref{{HamDS}). This $H$ can  be written in the form of Eq. (\ref{{DiracSup}) with the association \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{HamDSMa} \lambda &=&\mu \beta \\  Q &=& \left (   \begin{{array}{{cc}   0 & 0 \\   M & 0 \end{{array}  \right ) \\  \label{{HamDSMaL}  Q^\dagger &=& \left (   \begin{{array}{{cc}   0 & M^\dagger\\   0 & 0 \end{{array}  \right ), \end{{eqnarray} where  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Mterm} M=\boldmathsigma\cdot({{\bf p}+{{\bf C})-i C_5, \end{{eqnarray} $C_I=A_I-i E_I$, $I=1,2,3,5$ and we use here,  unless otherwise stated, the standard representation for the Dirac matrices\cite{{Bjor}. The expression for the Hamiltonian in Eq. (\ref{{HamDS}), after application of the FWT and after using Eqs. (\ref{{HamDSMa})-(\ref{{HamDSMaL}), is \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{HamFW}  H^\prime &=& \beta\left [\left (   \begin{{array}{{cc}   MM^\dagger+\mu^2 & 0 \\   0 & M^\dagger M+\mu^2 \end{{array}  \right )\right ]^{{1/2}, \end{{eqnarray} where the equation to solve is \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{HamFWeq}  H^\prime \Psi =E \Psi. \end{{eqnarray} The equality between positive and negative spectrum, except for a sign, follows from the equal eigenvalues expected for both terms.  The square-operator  form  of the upper and lower terms of $H^\prime$ on Eq. (\ref{{HamFW}) suggests a simplification by considering the action of  single operators. Clearly, this is permitted when $M$ is hermitian. It is then is possible to reformulate   Eq. (\ref{{HamFWeq})  in terms of another   eigenvalue equation as alternative sufficient condition, linear in $M$, and   given by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Eigenfacil} M \psi=E_c\psi, \end{{eqnarray} where $\psi$ is the positive energy spinor  component of $\Psi$ since, as can be proved, both the upper and lower sides in $H^\prime$ in Eq. (\ref{{HamFWeq})  have the same eigenvalues.  In fact, this equation is valid also in the case $M$ is not hermitian and therefore $E_c$ complex, for  we only require $|E_c|^2 = E^2-\mu^2$.  The linear form of  Eq. (\ref{{Eigenfacil}) hints at a possible separation of  degrees of freedom corresponding to different dimensions. The separation of this equation (in the stationary case) into independent components describing different dimensions $M=M_1+M_2$ is limited, for  the  form of $M$ implies that even if use, say, in $H_1$ potentials with restrained dependence on the coordinates we generally obtain $[M_1,M_2]\neq 0$. %As illustrative model, we first study the $3+1 %\rightarrow 1+1$ separation.  Still, we can find a partial separation of the 3+1 Eq. \ref{{Eigenfacil} into  1+1 dimensional terms and  two additional dimensional terms (1+1 scalar). We choose the 1+1 spatial coordinate as $z$, with $ x_1=x$, $x_2=y$, $x_3=z$, and \begin{{eqnarray}  \label{{M1} M_1=\sigma_z [p_z+C_z(z)], \end{{eqnarray} \begin{{eqnarray}  \label{{M2} M_2=\boldmathsigma_b \cdot [{{\bf p}_b+{{\bf C}_b(x,y)], \end{{eqnarray}  where $b$ represents the $(\hat x, \hat y)$ directions, and ${{\bf C}_b(x,y)=(C_x(x,y),C_y(x,y))$, with dependences of ${{\bf C}_b$ and $C_z$  as specified.   The Anzats \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{anzats}  \psi =\left ( \begin{{array} {{c} g_1(x,y) f_1(z)\\ g_2(x,y) f_2(z) \end{{array}\right ) \end{{eqnarray} leads to the partial separation of Eq. \ref{{HamFWeq} \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{sepa1}  M_1\left ( \begin{{array} {{c} f_1(z)\\ f_2(z) \end{{array}\right  )=  \left ( \begin{{array} {{c} E_1 f_1(z)\\  {{E_1}^\prime f_2(z) \end{{array}\right  ), \end{{eqnarray} where we have used the diagonal character (in spin space) of the $M_1$ component which allows for cancellation of the $g_i(x,y)$ in Eq. (\ref{{sepa1}). We further assume that the upper and lower components share the same solutions, so that $f_1(z)=f_2(z)$. Then, $E_1=-{{E_1}^\prime$.  We note solutions can be interpreted as positive and negative chirality components in 1+1 space. The other part of  Eq. \ref{{HamFWeq} has consequently the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{sepa2}  M_2\left ( \begin{{array} {{c} g_1(x,y)\\ g_2(x,y) \end{{array}\right  )=\left ( \begin{{array} {{c} (E_c-E_1)g_1(x,y)\\  (E_c+E_1) g_2(x,y) \end{{array}\right ) \end{{eqnarray}  and the $z$ dependence can be divided out. The $M_2$  part plays the role of a scalar interaction in  $1+1$ space. The absence of the $f_i(z)$ functions implies the eigenvalues $E_c$ depend on the $f_i$ solutions only through $E_1$. Thus, this separation is only partial yet  sufficient for our purposes because it decouples at least one group of dimensions. It is clear that the separation depends on the presence of a diagonalizable component  as $M_1$, and on the  specific  spatial dependence of the potentials in $M_1$, $M_2$, in accordance to the Lorentz index of the $\alpha_i$ matrices. In this case, it is the need to account for the   spin degree of freedom that  requires the additional condition that $M_1$ be diagonalizable. We also find that in passing from the higher dimension to the lower, the original spin is reinterpreted  and forms the  chiral components in the lower dimension. \section{{Dirac supersymmetry in higher dimensions} A thorough analysis of the process of Dirac supersymmetric Hamiltonians breaking into lower dimensional components requires an understanding of a Dirac-matrices construction which exhibits Dirac supersymmetry. This analysis is performed in detail in Ref. \cite{{MatRos} and here we reproduce some useful results. In general, a Clifford algebra is defined through the anticommutation relations \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{anticomm} \alpha_i \alpha_j+\alpha_j\alpha_i=2\delta_{{ij}, \end{{eqnarray} where $i,j=0,1,...,d-1$ and $d$ is an integer. The main relation that we will use is a  recursive formula that provides the elements of the even-$d$ algebra in terms of the $d-2$ algebra. This is \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{recualg}  \alpha_0 & = \sigma_3 \otimes \hat 1=& \left (   \begin{{array}{{cc}   \hat 1 & 0 \\   0 & -\hat 1 \end{{array} \right )\\ \alpha_i & =  \sigma_1 \otimes \hat \alpha_i=& \left (   \begin{{array}{{cc}   0 & \hat\alpha_i \\  \hat\alpha_i & 0 \end{{array}\right )\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1\leq i \leq d-2 \\  \alpha_{{d-1} & =  \sigma_1 \otimes \hat 1=& \left (   \begin{{array}{{cc}   0 & \hat\alpha_0 \\ \label{{recualgend}   \hat\alpha_0 & 0 \end{{array}\right )\\ \label{{recualgF} \alpha_{{d} & =  \sigma_2 \otimes \hat 1=& \left (   \begin{{array}{{cc}   0 &  -i\hat 1 \\   i\hat 1 & 0 \end{{array}\right ),  \end{{eqnarray}  where the caret denotes the lower-dimensional algebra. The latter element  $\alpha_d$  is obtained from the definition \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{alphad}  \alpha_d=e^{{-i(d/2)\pi/2}\alpha_0...\alpha_{{d-1}, \end{{eqnarray} and it extends the algebra from even $d$  to odd $d+1$.  The  Lorentz generator antisymmetric tensors, generalized to any dimension, can be deduced from Eqs. (\ref{{recualg})-(\ref{{recualgF}) and the definition of the $\gamma$ matrices $\gamma^0=\beta$, $\gamma^i=\beta\alpha_i$. They can be shown to be \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{antismunu}  \sigma^{{\mu\nu}=\frac{{i}{{2}[\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu]= \left (   \begin{{array}{{ccc}   0& i \sigma_1 \otimes \hat \alpha_i & i \sigma_2 \otimes \hat 1  \\    & 1 \otimes \hat \sigma^{{ij} &   \sigma_3 \otimes \hat \alpha_i\\      & &  0 \end{{array}  \right ) \begin{{array}{{c} 0\\1\leq i \leq d-1\\d, \end{{array} \end{{eqnarray} where the rows' labels are given and the column labels follow the same order (the elements below the diagonal are minus the transpose of those above).   In general, by investigating the general structure of all supersymmetric terms, one can also show all Dirac-supersymmetric interactions have the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{genform} Q&=&\frac{{1}{{2}(\sigma_1+i\sigma_2)\otimes \hat q \\ Q^\dagger&=&\frac{{1}{{2}(\sigma_1-i\sigma_2)\otimes \hat q^\dagger, \end{{eqnarray} where $\hat q$ represents any  interaction   in the $d-2$ space. With this characterization one may proceed  from the transformation that departs from Eq. (\ref{{DiracSup}), goes through $H^\prime$ in Eq. (\ref{{FWtrans}) and leads  to Eq. (\ref{{HamFW}), an expression containing of $Q+Q^\dagger$ and $\lambda$, and use the preceding section to select interactions that allow for dimensional separation.  \section{{$U(1)$ magnetic field as Dirac-supersymmetric interaction} A magnetic field derived from a general $U(1)$ interaction satisfies both conditions of Dirac supersymmetry and separability. It is possible to describe it in  any dimension in terms of an expression for $\boldmathpi$ of the form of  Eq. (\ref{{pi}).  \subsection{{$3+1 \rightarrow   1+1$ reduction} In  the $3+1$ dimensional case  a constant magnetic field along the $\hat z$ direction \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{3dmag} {{\bf A} =-\frac{{1}{{2} {{\bf  r} \times {{\bf  B} \end{{eqnarray} corresponds to the real elements in Eq. (\ref{{HamDS})  ${{\mathsf A}_I=e A_I$, $I=1,2,3,$ where $e$ is the $U(1)$ coupling constant (corresponding to the  electric charge) and the ${{\bf A}$ components are \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{A3d} A_1=A_x=-\frac{{1}{{2} y B,\ \ \ A_2=A_y=\frac{{1}{{2} x B, \ \ \ A_3=A_z=0. \end{{eqnarray}   The Hamiltonian $H^\prime $ (Eq. (\ref{{FWtrans}))  results in \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{KKmag} H^\prime= \alpha_0  {{[ (\boldmathalpha\cdot\boldmathpi)^2+\mu^2 ]}^{{1/2} . \end{{eqnarray} That the magnetic field interaction chosen in Eq. (\ref{{A3d})  separates  in the sense of Eqs. (\ref{{sepa1}) and (\ref{{sepa2}) can be seen from the  construction of $H^\prime$ in Eq. (\ref{{KKmag}). $H^\prime$ is composed from a term multiplying the unit matrix and the term \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{KKmagpp}    (\boldmathalpha\cdot\boldmathpi)^2 &=& \alpha_i \alpha_j \pi_i \pi_j \\                                       &=& (\frac{{1}{{2} \{{ \alpha_i,\alpha_j \} +  \frac{{1}{{2}[\alpha_i,\alpha_j]) \pi_i \pi_j   \\ \label{{KKmagppL} &=&  \boldmathpi\cdot\boldmathpi+ i\sigma_{{ij} \pi_i \pi_j,  \end{{eqnarray} where use has been made of Eqs. (\ref{{anticomm}) and (\ref{{antismunu}). The term \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{sepaKK}i\sigma_{{ij} \pi_i \pi_j=i 1\otimes \hat\sigma_{{ij}\pi_i \pi_j, \end{{eqnarray} where Eq. (\ref{{antismunu}) has been used, gives rise to a separable equation, which will be shown explicitly in the Appendix.  %It follows that it is %possible to directly extract each of the positive-negative energy %components which in the $ 3+1\rightarrow 1+1$. *optional  Squaring of $H^\prime$ of  Eq. (\ref{{KKmag}) in Eq. (\ref{{HamFWeq}) and further reduction lead to the equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{equMAg3} ({{\bf p}\cdot {{\bf p} -2ie {{\bf A}\cdot {{ \boldmathnabla} + e^2 {{\bf A} \cdot {{\bf A}+2e S_z B) \Psi=E^2 \Psi , \end{{eqnarray} where $S_z=\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_1\gamma_2$ is the spin along $\hat {{\bf z}$.  This equation can also be written in terms of the orbital angular momentum $z$-component $L_z=-i(\partial_y x- \partial_x y)$  as \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{equMAg3mod} [-{{\boldmathnabla}^2   + \frac{{1}{{4}e^2 B^2 \rho^2+e {{B}(L_z+ 2 S_z )] \Psi=E^2 \Psi , \end{{eqnarray} where $\rho^2=x^2+y^2$ is the radial cylindrical coordinate. As can be seen in the Appendix, the separation of  this equation  is manifest within these coordinates. This equation has the  well-known  non-relativistic ($nr$) Schr\"odinger-equation counterpart of a scalar  particle in a magnetic field of magnitude $B$\cite{{Gasio} \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{equMAg3modNR} \frac{{1}{{2 \mu}(-{{\boldmathnabla}^2   + \frac{{1}{{4}e^2 B^2 \rho^2+e {{B}L_z ) \Psi_{{nr}=E_{{nr}\Psi_{{nr}. \end{{eqnarray} When $\Psi_{{nr}$ is  separated into   cylindrical coordinates  $\Psi_{{nr}= u(\rho)e^{{ik_zz}e^{{im\phi}$ the radial component $u(\rho)$ satisfies \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{nonrel} u^{{\prime\prime}+\frac{{1}{{\rho}u^\prime-\frac{{m^2}{{\rho^2}u-\frac{{e^2B^2}{{4}\rho^2u+\left ( 2 \mu E_{{nr}-k_z^2-eBm\right )u=0 \end{{eqnarray} with corresponding energy \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Landau} E_{{nr}=\frac{{k_z^2} {{2\mu} +\frac{{e B}{{2\mu}(2 n_r+1+|m|+m) \ \ \ n_r=0,1,...,\ \ \ \ \end{{eqnarray} where  $m$, $n_r$ are quantum numbers related to  $L_z$  and the radial motion, respectively. The Landau levels emerge not surprisingly.   The solution of the  relativistic   Eq. (\ref{{equMAg3mod}) follows from  Eq. (\ref{{equMAg3modNR}), which differs from the former, up to factors, by the spin operator. Eq.  (\ref{{equMAg3mod}) constitutes only a necessary condition and has in fact more freedom in the  solutions than the original Eq. (\ref{{HamFWeq}) (albeit the energies are the same, for the latter equation is obtained from the modified Foldy-Wouthuysen unitary transformation). The eigenfunctions from the original equations are worked out in the Appendix. The results can be obtained by using the eigenfunctions of the total angular  momentum component $L_z+S_z$,  which leads to equations of the form of the massless ($\mu=0$) (A.\ref{{decoupledeqs})-(A.\ref{{decoupledeqsend})  or massive (A.\ref{{massdecoupledeqexp})-(A.\ref{{massdecoupledeqexpend}). The energy eigenvalues are \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{massdecoupledeqs} &E=\sqrt{{k_z^2+2eB( n_r+ m+1)+\mu^2}\ \ \ & m\geq 0\ \ \ n_r=0,1,...\\ \ \ \ \ \label{{massdecoupledeqso} &E=\sqrt{{k_z^2+2 eB n_r+\mu^2}\ \ \ & m< 0\ \ \ n_r=1,2,...\ \ \ \ \end{{eqnarray}  \subsection{{$5+1\rightarrow 3+1$ reduction }  The procedure we have followed in Eqs. (\ref{{KKmag})-(\ref{{equMAg3}) is valid for any dimensional reduction. In the 5+1 case \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{3dmagend}  A_1=A_x=0, \ \ \  A_2=A_3=0, \ \ \  A_3=A_z=0, \ \ \ \nonumber \\ \label{{A5d} A_4=A_u=-\frac{{1}{{2} v B,\ \ \ A_5=A_v=\frac{{1}{{2} u B, \end{{eqnarray} where we have chosen  5-$d$ coordinate  labels $ (u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4,u_5)=(x,y,z,u,v).$ Generalized terms $\pi_I $ are then obtained from  Eq. (\ref{{pi}), using the corresponding ${{\mathsf A}_{{I}$ terms defined above and  the ${{\mathsf E}_I=0$. %One just needs to check the solution in the actual equation. (*DO IT?) The Hamiltonian $H^\prime $ (Eq. (\ref{{FWtrans}))  results in \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{KKmag5D} H^\prime= \alpha_0  {{[ (\boldmathalpha\cdot\boldmathpi)^2+(\alpha_I \pi_I)^2+ \mu^2  ]}^{{1/2}  \ \ \ \ \ ( I\ {{\rm  summed\  over\  4,5}). \end{{eqnarray} The $5+1\rightarrow 3+1$ case  equation,  counterpart to Eq. (\ref{{equMAg3}), with the magnetic field in Eq. (\ref{{A5d}) has the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{equMAg3mod6d}  [-{{\bf \boldmathnabla}^2-\partial_u^2-\partial_v^2   + \frac{{1}{{4}e^2 B^2 \rho^2+e {{B}(L_{{45}+ 2 S_{{45} )] \Psi=E^2 \Psi , \end{{eqnarray} where now  $\rho^2=u^2+v^2$, $L_{{45}= -i(\partial_v u- \partial_u v)$,   $S_{{45}=\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_4\gamma_5$, and the  spectrum has a similar form to Eqs. (\ref{{massdecoupledeqs})-(\ref{{massdecoupledeqso}), with the transformation $k_z^2\rightarrow {{\bf k}^2$, ${{\bf k}$ representing the 3-$d$ momentum, which gives a contribution to the energy  as a free-particle kinetic term. This is but a consequence of the {{\it decoupling } caused by the fact that the interaction acts purely on the $u$, $v$ dimensions but leaves the other free. This in turn results from the form of the interaction which separates the equations corresponding to Eqs. (\ref{{M1}) and (\ref{{M2}).  Thus, we obtain a tower of states, similarly to the Kaluza-Klein mechanism, but with different associated radii (up to degeneracy), the minimum being occupied by the ground state. %NEW  The form of Eqs. (\ref{{massdecoupledeqs})-(\ref{{massdecoupledeqso})  suggests that the magnetic field  extra-dimensional parameter may be interpreted as a mass term in ``real" dimensions. Therefore, we note that a mass-creation mechanism emerges here, with the masses appearing with a characteristic spectrum. This mechanism is possible only in a reduction from even $d$ to $d-2$ dimensions.  Although other Dirac-supersymmetric interactions lead to compactification, they elude a simple solution treatment as obtained with the magnetic field. %NEW      \section{{Conclusions}      In this work we have presented a mechanism for compactification through gauge fields. This mechanism allows for independent behavior in some dimensions  but forces motion of particles in the other dimensions to be confined, which amounts to an effective compactification  (driven by a physical process).  Simplicity and succinctness are gained for compactification can be ascribed to a field rather than being assumed. Also, the  familiar gauge fields can produce this mechanism, without need to invoke others. Although in this work we have concentrated on the didactic $3+1\rightarrow 1+1$ and novel $5+1\rightarrow 3+1$ cases, this mechanism is applicable to any even-dimension reduction $d+2\rightarrow d$. In addition,  this mechanism is  general in the sense that it is valid  for fundamental spin-1/2 matter fields.   The results obtained are general for the compactification presented  can be relevant both independently of or in relation to curved space. In the latter case, it is  assumed that these interactions could be eventually related to the gravitational field acting in the additional dimensions. %NEW   However, this work remains exploratory for it concentrates more in showing such a mechanism is possible and one still needs further generalization to relate it to  a universal interaction. Fields generated by the hypercharge interaction together with non-abelian ones as the  electroweak interaction or gravitational fields are feasible candidates. Some ideas on possible constraints on allowed dimensions and interactions are found in Ref. \cite{{bespro}. In addition, there is room for additional types of interaction producing compactificaction. The $U(1)$ magnetic field chosen here preserves translational symmetry which implies the choice of coordinate around which particles rotate in the extra dimensions is arbitrary. Further characterization of the interaction may lead, for example, to a choice of this point in the compactification plane, which would violate Poincar\'e invariance in the extra dimensions, without direct influence in the ``real" ones, just as occurs for branes in string theory.  Another outcome of this work is a possible mass creation mechanism. We have shown that a mass of a free particle in 4-$d$ space can be generated through an  interaction acting on  5 and 6 dimensions.   The   main lesson from this paper is that it is possible to construct a compactifying interaction which features dimensional decoupling, at least for the ``real" dimensions, and which may have consequences in terms of parameters as the mass, but otherwise leave the same physics  for free physical particles. It should be interesting to consider the presence of   interactions inside ``real" space.  Further work should then deal with non-abelian fields, consider  other separable interactions,  additional multipoles of the magnetic field, and gravitation,  and try to relate them to cosmological models, for these fields should appear self-consistently.   \noindent{{\bf Acknowledgments}  The authors  acknowledge support from  DGAPA-UNAM through project IN127298.

(\ref{{equMAg3mod}) and (\ref{{equMAg3mod6d}), for the massless and massive cases.  {{\bf Massless case}  We use the chiral representation for the Dirac matrices. Then,  the $3+1$ component of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (\ref{{HamDS}) leads to \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{metric}  \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} \boldmathsigma\cdot(-i{{ \boldmathnabla }- {{\mathbf A}) & 0  \\ 0 & -\boldmathsigma\cdot(-i{{  \boldmathnabla}- {{\mathbf A}) \end{{array} \right)\Psi=E\Psi, \end{{eqnarray} where, from Eq. (\ref{{A3d}),  a constant magnetic along $\hat{{\bf z}$  is given by ${{\bf A}=\frac{{1}{{2}B(-y,x,0).$ We use the constants of the motion to obtain and classify the solutions. These comprise a component of the total angular momentum, the momentum, both  in the $\hat{{\bf  z}$ direction, and, of course, the Hamiltonian. In the massless case the chirality  is also a constant  of the motion and we use it to   separate  Eq. (A.\ref{{metric}) into its chiral components. From the form of $\gamma_5$ in the  chiral representation \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{gamm5chi}  \gamma_5=\left( \begin{{array}{{cc} I & 0  \\ 0 & -I \end{{array} \right) \end{{eqnarray} the upper and lower parts of $\Psi$ \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{chiralcom}  \Psi=\left( \begin{{array}{{c} \Psi_1   \\ \Psi_2 \end{{array} \right) \end{{eqnarray} correspond to its positive and negative chirality components, respectively. We now consider the upper, positive chirality part while it is clear that the other part is obtained with the solution interchange $E\rightarrow -E$. Given the constants of the motion we propose  as Anzats for $\Psi_1$, using cylindrical coordinates $(\rho,\phi,z)$,  separation into a plane wave along the $\hat{{\bf  z}$ direction with momentum $k_z$, a $J_z$ eigenstate with associated angular momentum $m+1/2$, and radial functions $f(\rho)$, $g(\rho)$ along the $xy$ plane \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{psi1}  \Psi_1=\left( \begin{{array}{{c} f(\rho)e^{{ik_zz}e^{{im\phi}   \\ i g(\rho)e^{{ik_zz}e^{{i(m+1)\phi} \end{{array} \right). \end{{eqnarray} With this form for $\Psi_1$ Eq. (A.\ref{{metric}) becomes \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{coupledeqs} k_z f+g^\prime+\frac{{m+1}{{\rho}g+e\frac{{B}{{2}\rho g=E f \\ -k_z g -f^\prime+\frac{{m}{{\rho}f+e\frac{{B}{{2}\rho f=E g. \label{{coupledeqsend} \end{{eqnarray} From Eq. (A.\ref{{coupledeqs})  $f$ can be expressed in terms $g$ and its derivative. By substituting this $f$ into Eq. (A.\ref{{coupledeqsend}),  and carrying out a similar  procedure for $g$ from  (A.\ref{{coupledeqsend}), one obtains the decoupled equations \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{decoupledeqs} f^{{\prime\prime}+\frac{{1}{{\rho}f^\prime-\frac{{m^2}{{\rho^2}f-\frac{{e^2B^2}{{4}\rho^2f+\left ( E^2-k_z^2-eB(m+1) \right )f=0\\  g^{{\prime\prime}+\frac{{1}{{\rho}g^\prime-\frac{{(m+1)^2}{{\rho^2}g-\frac{{e^2B^2}{{4}\rho^2g+\left ( E^2-k_z^2-eBm \right )g=0.\label{{decoupledeqsend} \end{{eqnarray} The solution of these equations is constructed with generalized Laguerre polynomials of the form $L_{{n_r}^{{|m|}(x^2)$, $x=\sqrt{{eB/2}\ \rho$, and each solution leads to the following eigenfunctions and energy eigenvalues\cite{{Gasio} (see also Eqs. (\ref{{nonrel})-(\ref{{Landau})): \noindent For $m\ge 0$ \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{gfsol} f(\rho)&=&x^{{|m|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m|}(x^2) \nonumber \\ g(\rho)&=&\frac{{{{\sqrt{{2 e B}}}{{{{E} + k_z}x^{{|m+1|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m+1|}(x^2), \ \ \ n_r=0,1,...,\ \ \ \ \end{{eqnarray} with  energy \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{energysol} E=\sqrt{{k_z^2+2eB( n_r+  m+1)}. \end{{eqnarray} The  global coefficients in $\Psi_1$ above and the wave functions below are arbitrary. To normalize the wave function one uses the cylindrical radial-component integral \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{inteLaguerre} \int_{{0}^{{\infty}dy  y^m e^{{-y} L_n^m(y)L_{{n^\prime}^m(y)=\left \{{ \begin{{array}{{cc} 0\ \ \ & \ \ \ \ n\neq n^\prime \\ \Gamma(1+m) \left( \begin{{array}{{c} n+m  \\ m \end{{array}  \right )\end{{array} \right . &  n= n^\prime . \end{{eqnarray}    For $m< 0$ \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{gfsolmm} f(\rho)&=&x^{{|m|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r-1}^{{|m|}(x^2)  \nonumber \\ g(\rho)&=& -\frac{{{{\sqrt{{2 e B}}}{{{{E} + k_z} n_r x^{{|m+1|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m+1|}(x^2), \ \ \ n_r=1,2,...,\ \ \ \ \end{{eqnarray} with  energy \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{energysolmm} E=\sqrt{{k_z^2+2eB n_r} \end{{eqnarray}  We see that in the latter case we have an increased degeneracy on the $m$ values which we  ascribe to the conceling contributions to the energy of the angular motion and its magnetic moment opposite to the magnetic field. We note our results differ from those in the textbook of Ref. \cite{{Sakurai}  which claims the spectrum in Eq. (A.\ref{{energysolmm}) (including incorrectly  the $n_r=0$ state), to be general but which represents only a specific type  of solution.  The negative chirality component $\Psi_2$ \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{psi2}  \Psi_2=\left( \begin{{array}{{c} h(\rho)e^{{ik_zz}e^{{im\phi}   \\ i j(\rho)e^{{ik_zz}e^{{i(m+1)\phi} \end{{array} \right) \end{{eqnarray} has the  solutions for $m\ge 0$ \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{gfsolnegchi} h(\rho)&=& x^{{|m|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m|}(x^2),  \nonumber \\ j(\rho)&=& \frac{{{{\sqrt{{2 e B}}}{{k_z-{{E} }x^{{|m+1|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m+1|}(x^2),\ \ \ n_r=0,1,...,\ \ \ \ \end{{eqnarray} with  energy \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{energysolnegchi} E=\sqrt{{k_z^2+2eB( n_r+  m+1)}. \end{{eqnarray} and for $m< 0$ \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{gfsolmmnegchi} h(\rho)&=&x^{{|m|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r-1}^{{|m|}(x^2) \nonumber \\ j(\rho)&=& -\frac{{{{\sqrt{{2 e B}}}{{k_z-{{E} } n_r x^{{|m+1|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m+1|}(x^2), \ \ \ n_r=1,2,...,\ \ \ \ \end{{eqnarray} with  energy \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{energysolmmnegchi} E=\sqrt{{k_z^2+2eB n_r} \end{{eqnarray}    {{\bf Massive case}  The massive equation \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{metricmass} \left [ \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} \boldmathsigma\cdot(-i{{ \boldmathnabla}- {{\mathbf A}) & 0  \\ 0 & -\boldmathsigma\cdot(-i{{\boldmathnabla}- {{\mathbf A}) \end{{array} \right)+\mu\beta\right ]\Psi=E\Psi. \end{{eqnarray}  can be solved using the same quantum numbers except that the  mass term (in the chiral representation)  \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{gamm0chi}  \beta=\gamma_0=\left( \begin{{array}{{cc} 0& -I  \\ -I & 0 \end{{array} \right) \end{{eqnarray}  mixes the  chirality components included in $\Psi$: $\Psi_1$ in Eq. (A.\ref{{psi1}) and $\Psi_2$ in Eq. (A.\ref{{psi1}), which leads  to the slightly more complicated four coupled radial equations for $f$,  $g$, $h$,  $j$ %\begin{{eqnarray} \begin{{eqnarray}  \label{{masscoupledeqs} k_z f+g^\prime+\frac{{m+1}{{\rho}g+e\frac{{B}{{2}\rho g-\mu h=E f \\ -k_z g -f^\prime+\frac{{m}{{\rho}f+e\frac{{B}{{2}\rho f-\mu j=E g \\ \label{{masscoupledeqs2} -k_z h-j^\prime-\frac{{m+1}{{\rho}j-e\frac{{B}{{2}\rho j-\mu f=E h \\ \label{{masscoupledeqs3} k_z j+h^\prime-\frac{{m}{{\rho}h-e\frac{{B}{{2}\rho h-\mu g=E j. \label{{masscoupledeqsend} \end{{eqnarray}  These equations decouple into four equations for each function. For example,  by solving for $g$  in Eq. (A.\ref{{masscoupledeqs2}) and for $h$  in Eq. (A.\ref{{masscoupledeqs3})  and substituting them into Eq. (A.\ref{{masscoupledeqs}) an  equation only  for $f$ is obtained; by using similar  procedures for the other functions one gets for all \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{massdecoupledeqexp} f^{{\prime\prime}+\frac{{1}{{\rho}f^\prime-\frac{{m^2}{{\rho^2}f-\frac{{e^2B^2}{{4}\rho^2f+\left ( E^2-k_z^2-eB(m+1)-\mu^2 \right )f=0\\  g^{{\prime\prime}+\frac{{1}{{\rho}g^\prime-\frac{{(m+1)^2}{{\rho^2}g-\frac{{e^2B^2}{{4}\rho^2g+\left ( E^2-k_z^2-eBm-\mu^2 \right )g=0\\  h^{{\prime\prime}+\frac{{1}{{\rho}h^\prime-\frac{{m^2}{{\rho^2}h-\frac{{e^2B^2}{{4}\rho^2h+\left ( E^2-k_z^2-eB(m+1)-\mu^2 \right )h=0\\  j^{{\prime\prime}+\frac{{1}{{\rho}j^\prime-\frac{{(m+1)^2}{{\rho^2}j-\frac{{e^2B^2}{{4}\rho^2j+\left ( E^2-k_z^2-eBm-\mu^2 \right  )j=0.\label{{massdecoupledeqexpend} \end{{eqnarray}  The solutions for  $m\ge 0$ are \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{gfsolmass} f(\rho)&=&x^{{|m|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m|}(x^2) \nonumber  \\ g(\rho)&=&\frac{{{{\sqrt{{2 e B}}}{{{{E} + k_z}x^{{|m+1|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m+1|}(x^2) \nonumber  \\ h(\rho)&=& -\frac{{{{\mu}}{{{{E} + k_z} x^{{|m|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m|}(x^2)  \nonumber  \\ j(\rho)&=& 0 , \ \ \ n_r=0,1,...,\ \ \ \ \end{{eqnarray} and for  $m< 0$ \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{gfsolmassnegm} f(\rho)&=&x^{{|m|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r-1}^{{|m|}(x^2) \nonumber  \\ g(\rho)&=&-\frac{{{{\sqrt{{2 e B}}}{{{{E} + k_z} n_r x^{{|m+1|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r}^{{|m+1|}(x^2)  \nonumber \\ h(\rho)&=& -\frac{{{{\mu}}{{{{E} + k_z} x^{{|m|}e^{{-x^2/2}L_{{n_r-1}^{{|m|}(x^2)  \nonumber \\ j(\rho)&=& 0 , \ \ \ n_r=0,1,...,\ \ \ \ \end{{eqnarray} with energies  as above, except that these are modified with a mass term, and they are  given in Eqs. (\ref{{massdecoupledeqs}) and (\ref{{massdecoupledeqso}).  This 4-$d$ massive case can also serve to solve the 6-$d$ massless equation with a generalized magnetic field. Indeed, we divide the extended Dirac Hamiltonian equation into the 3-  and 4- and 5-$d$ components \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{HamDSApe} ( {{ \boldmathalpha}\cdot{{\bf p}+{{ \alpha}_I {{\bf \pi}_I)  \Psi=E\Psi  \ \ \ \ \ ( I\ {{\rm  summed\  over\  4,5}), \end{{eqnarray} %by making the appropriate relations among variables. where  $\pi_I =p_I-{{\mathsf A}_I,$  and the ${{\mathsf  A}_I$  are obtained from Eq. (\ref{{3dmagend}).  The   3-$d$ space components appear with bold type. This massless equation can be projected into the  two chiral components by $\frac{{1}{{2}(1\pm \gamma_7)$, with  $\gamma_7=-i\alpha_0\alpha_6$ (Eqs. (\ref{{recualg}), (\ref{{recualgend})) being the matrix  which anticommutes with all 6-$d$ ${{\gamma_\mu} 's.$ Each projected equation can be written in terms of 4-$d$ matrices. As these satisfy the same relations as those contained in Eq. (A.\ref {{metricmass}), with the mapping 6-$d\rightarrow 4$-$d$ with $\frac{{1}{{2}(1 + \gamma_7){{\boldmathalpha} \cdot {{\bf p}\rightarrow \mu \beta$, $\frac{{1}{{2}(1 + \gamma_7){{ \alpha}_I {{\bf \pi}_I \rightarrow {{ \boldmathalpha}\cdot {{ \boldmathpi}$, one obtains the corresponding set of equations as (A.\ref{{masscoupledeqs})-(A.\ref{{masscoupledeqs3}) (and similarly for the other chirality part).   The equations   solved here can also be useful to solve the intermediate Eq. (\ref{{Eigenfacil}), and reproduce in fact the separation of variables as described in Section 3.   % EST\'A MUY ENDOG\'AMICA LA BIBLIOGRAF\'IA !!!  %\hskip \begin{{thebibliography}{{99} \bibitem{{anto} I.

Such compactifications are required within the context of superstring theory in order to  make connections with realistic particle physics.  We study the dynamics of brane gases constructed from various string theories on background spaces having a K3 submanifold.  The K3 compactifications provide a stepping stone for generalising the model to the case of a full  Calabi-Yau three-fold.  Duality symmetries are discussed within a cosmological context.  Using a duality, we arrive at an N=2 theory in four-dimensions  compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold with SU(3) holonomy. We argue that the Brane Gas model compactified on such spaces maintains the  successes of the trivial toroidal compactification while greatly enhancing its connection to particle physics.     The initial state of the universe is taken to be a small,  hot and dense gas of p-branes near thermal equilibrium.  The universe has no initial singularity and the dynamics of string winding modes allow three spatial dimensions to grow large, providing a possible solution to the dimensionality  problem of string theory.   \vspace*{{8mm}   \noindent   PACS numbers: 04.50+h; 11.25.Mj; 98.80.Bp; 98.80.Cq. \\ %Keywords: %Brane gases, Calabi-Yau manifolds, K3 spaces. \end{{abstract}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \vfill   %----------------------------------------------------------------------   %\hrule   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \bigskip   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \centerline{{\underline{{E-mail:} {{\tt easson@hep.physics.mcgill.ca}}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \bigskip   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------     %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   %\centerline{{\underline{{Homepage:} {{\sf http://www.physics.foo.edu/\~{{}whoever}}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \bigskip   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \centerline{{\underline{{arXiv:}   {{\tt hep-th/0110225}}   %----------------------------------------------------------------------   \bigskip   %\hrule   \clearpage   %---------------------------------------------------------------------   % User definitions   %--------------------------------------------------------------------   \def\Box{{\nabla^2}   %---------------------------   \def\d{{{{\mathrm d}}   %----------------------------   \def\ie{{{{\em i.e.\/}}   \def\eg{{{{\em e.g.\/}}   \def\etc{{{{\em etc.\/}}   \def\etal{{{{\em et al.\/}}   %----------------------------   \def\S{{{{\mathcal S}}   \def\I{{{{\mathcal I}}   \def\L{{{{\mathcal L}}   \def\H{{{{\mathcal H}}   \def\M{{{{\mathcal M}}   \def\N{{{{\mathcal N}}  \def\cP{{{{\mathcal P}}  \def\R{{{{\mathcal R}}   \def\K{{{{\mathcal K}}   \def\W{{{{\mathcal W}}   \def\mM{{{{\mathbf M}}  \def\mP{{{{\mathbf P}}  \def\mT{{{{\mathbf T}}  \def\mR{{{{\mathbf R}} \def\mS{{{{\mathbf S}} \def\mX{{{{\mathbf X}} \def\mZ{{{{\mathbf Z}}  %\def\gg{{\mbox{{\gothfamily g}} %\def\fg{{\mbox{{\frakfamily g}} %\def\fd{{\mbox{{\frakfamily d}} %-----------------------------   \def\eff{{{{\mathrm{{eff}}}   \def\Newton{{{{\mathrm{{Newton}}}   \def\bulk{{{{\mathrm{{bulk}}}   \def\brane{{{{\mathrm{{brane}}}   \def\matter{{{{\mathrm{{matter}}}   \def\tr{{{{\mathrm{{tr}}}   \def\normal{{{{\mathrm{{normal}}}   \def\implies{{\Rightarrow}   \def\half{{{{1\over2}}   %------------------------------ \newcommand{{\da}{{\dot{{a}} \newcommand{{\db}{{\dot{{b}} \newcommand{{\dn}{{\dot{{n}} \newcommand{{\dda}{{\ddot{{a}} \newcommand{{\ddb}{{\ddot{{b}} \newcommand{{\ddn}{{\ddot{{n}} \def\be{{\begin{{equation}} \def\ee{{\end{{equation}} \def\bea{{\begin{{eqnarray}} \def\eea{{\end{{eqnarray}} \def\bs{{\begin{{subequations}} \def\es{{\end{{subequations}} \def\g{{\gamma} \def\G{{\Gamma} \def\vp{{\varphi} \def\mpl{{M_{{\rm P}} \def\ms{{M_{{\rm s}} \def\ls{{l_{{\rm s}} \def\l{{\lambda} \def\gs{{g_{{\rm s}} \def\d{{\partial} \def\co{{{{\cal O}} \def\sp{{\;\;\;,\;\;\;} \def\spa{{\;\;\;} \def\r{{\rho} \def\dr{{\dot r} \def\dt{{\dot\varphi} \def\e{{\epsilon} \def\k{{\kappa} \def\m{{\mu} \def\n{{\nu} \def\om{{\omega} \def\tn{{\tilde \nu} \def\p{{\phi} \def\vp{{\varphi} \def\r{{\rho} \def\s{{\sigma} \def\t{{\tau} \def\a{{\alpha} \def\b{{\beta} \def\de{{\delta} \def\bra#1{{\left\langle #1\right|} \def\ket#1{{\left| #1\right\rangle} \newcommand{{\stt}{{\small\tt} \renewcommand{{\theequation}{{\arabic{{section}.\arabic{{equation}} \newcommand{{\eq}[1]{{equation~(\ref{{#1})} \newcommand{{\eqs}[2]{{equations~(\ref{{#1}) and~(\ref{{#2})} \newcommand{{\eqto}[2]{{equations~(\ref{{#1}) to~(\ref{{#2})} \newcommand{{\fig}[1]{{Fig.~(\ref{{#1})} \newcommand{{\figs}[2]{{Figs.~(\ref{{#1}) and~(\ref{{#2})} \newcommand{{\GeV}{{\mbox{{GeV}} %-----------------------------------------------------------------------    \def\SIZE{{1.00} % for graphics package   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------    \baselineskip .8cm       %------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \section{{Introduction}   %------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \label{{intro}   %------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The goal of this paper is to deepen the connection between the Brane Gas Cosmology (BGC) presented  in~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv,Brandenberger:2001kj} and realistic models of particle physics derived from superstring theory.   The BGC model employs the Brandenberger-Vafa mechanism  of~\cite{{Brandenberger:1989aj}, in an attempt to understand the  origin of our large $(3+1)$-dimensional universe, while simultaneously resolving the initial singularity problem of standard Big Bang cosmology.  Although we have been relatively successful in keeping with these ambitions, the price we pay is that we have made little connection with  realistic particle physics.  Part of this problem arises from the  toroidal compactification of superstring theory used in~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}. It is well known that compactifications of superstrings on manifolds of trivial holonomy cannot produce realistic models of particle physics.    The original setting for the BGC model was within Type IIA string theory. In this paper we present modifications of BGC by studying the model within the context of  other branches of the $M$-theory moduli space. We consider the physics of the resulting $p$-brane gases on manifolds with non-trivial holonomy.  In particular, we focus our attention on a manifold with a $K3$ subspace.  Such compactifications are of interest for numerous reasons, as we shall see below.  For one, it seems that the mathematics of $K3$ is intimately connected to the heterotic string, which is the superstring theory that is most easily related to realistic particle physics.  We use the fact that a certain string theory compactified on $K3 \times \mT^2$ can be related via duality to another string theory on a Calabi-Yau three-fold  with $SU(3)$ holonomy.  The general results  of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv} remain intact.  Using the rich properties of $K3$ surfaces and the dualities which (with strings) tie together the various  branches of the $M$-theory moduli space, we come ever closer to the construction of a potentially  realistic model of the universe.    Of course, the only physically relevant case is that of an $\N=1$ theory in four dimensions.  Unfortunately, we do not produce such a theory here! However, some of the models presented in this paper provide a significant improvement to the toroidal compactifications of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}.  We provide an existence proof of a brane gas cosmology with an $\N=2$ theory in four  dimensions compactified on a Calabi-Yau three-fold with $SU(3)$ holonomy.   Despite the lack of one-cycles in such spaces there are cases where only three spatial dimensions can become large. It is our hope that such theories may provide clues to the behavior of more realistic, $\N=1$ models.  The brane gas model solves the dimensionality problem, possibly revealing the origin of our four-dimensional universe.  The model also solves the initial singularity and horizon problem of the standard Big Bang cosmology without relying on an inflationary phase. Note that we do not exclude the possibility of an inflationary phase (perhaps along the lines of the string-inspired inflationary models of~\cite{{Burgess:2001fx}~-~\cite{{Turok:1988pg}) during some stage in the evolution of the universe.  The presentation of this paper is as follows. Section~\ref{{dimp} introduces the dimensionality problem as a problem for both string theory and cosmology. We discuss the fact that eleven-dimensional supergravity places an upper bound on the number of spatial dimensions in our universe and introduce the model of Brane Gas Cosmology in section~\ref{{bgc} in an attempt to explain why we live in a three-dimensional world.  Section~\ref{{bgk3} introduces the  first steps toward generalising the model of Brane Gas Cosmology to  manifolds with nontrivial holonomy.  Various scenarios are constructed from different branches of the $M$-theory moduli space and in different background topologies.  We then attempt to relate the different constructions via dualities.  We argue that these cosmological scenarios provide further evidence for the conjectured dualities.  Some final thoughts are presented in section~\ref{{conc}. %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \subsection{{The Dimensionality Problem} %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \label{{dimp}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  Arguably, one of the most significant dilemmas in string theory is the dimensionality problem. A consistent formulation of superstring theory requires the universe to be $(9+1)$-dimensional but  empirical evidence demonstrates that the universe is $(3+1)$-dimensional.    One resolution to this apparent conflict  is to hypothesise that six of the spatial dimensions are curled  up on a near Planckian sized manifold, and are therefore difficult to detect in the low energy world that we live in.   But if this is the case, the question naturally arises, why is there a difference in size and structure between our large $3$-dimensional universe and the $6$-dimensional compact space?  What physical laws demand that spacetime be split in such a seemingly unusual way?  Since we are assuming superstring theory is the correct theory to describe the physical universe, the answer to these questions must come from within the theory itself.  Although the dimensionality problem is a very severe problem from a  cosmological viewpoint it is rarely addressed.  For example,  brane world cosmological models derived from string theories  typically impose the identification of our universe with a $3$-brane.  All current formulations fail to explain why our universe is a $d$-brane of spatial dimension $d=3$, opposed to any other value of $d$, and furthermore fail to explain why our universe is this particular $3$-brane opposed to any other $3$-brane which may appear in the theory.  Due to the current unnatural construction of such models, it seems possible that they will inevitably require some form of the anthropic principle in order to address the dimensionality problem.  The dimensionality problem is not unique to string theory, however; it is an equally challenging problem for cosmology.  A truly complete cosmological model (if it is possible to obtain such a thing), whether derived from $M$-theory, quantum gravity or any other theory, should necessarily explain why we live in $(3+1)$-dimensions.  Because this conundrum is an integral part of both superstring theory and cosmology, it seems likely that only an amalgamation of the two will be capable of producing a satisfactory solution.  After all, if one is going to evolve from a $9$-dimensional space to a $3$-dimensional space, one is going to require dynamics, and the dynamics of our universe are  governed by cosmology. %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \subsection{{Brane Gas Cosmology} %-----------------------------------------------------------------------   \label{{bgc}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  The search for an explanation of spacetime structure and dimensionality is not completely hopeless.  It is possible to show that the largest dimension in which one can construct a supergravity theory is in $D=11$, thus providing an upper limit on the number of spacetime dimensions~\cite{{Nahm:1978tg}.~\footnote{{By a supergravity theory we mean a theory containing particles with a maximum spin of 2.} Eleven dimensional supergravity is of  particular interest since it has been identified as the low energy limit of  $M$-theory~\cite{{Townsend:1995kk,Witten:1995ex}.   Because of this conjecture the theory provides an ideal starting point for the construction of an $M$-cosmology.    Eleven dimensional supergravity contains only three fields: the vielbein $e^A_M$ (or equivalently the graviton $G_{{MN}$),  a Majorana gravitino $\psi_M$ and a three-form potential $A_{{MNP}$.  Here the indices are eleven-valued.   In order to have equal numbers of bosonic and  fermionic fields one must have the following number of degrees of freedom for each of these fields: $e^A_M = 44$ components,  $\psi_M= 128$ components and $A_{{MNP}= 84$ components (see, for example~\cite{{West:1998ey}).  The full Lagrangian for this theory was first written down by Cremmer, Julia and Scherk in~\cite{{Cremmer:1978km} and will serve as our starting point: %   \begin{{eqnarray}   \L=  &&\hspace{{-6mm}   - {{1 \over 2\k^2}eR - \frac{{1}{{2} e\bar\psi_M \Gamma^{{MNP} D_N \left( \frac{{1}{{2} (\om + \hat\om) \right) \psi_P -\frac{{1}{{48}eF^2_{{MNPQ}   \nonumber \\   &&\hspace{{-6mm}   -{{\sqrt{{2}\k \over 384}e    \left(\bar\psi_M \Gamma^{{MNPQRS}\psi_S + 12 \bar\psi^N \Gamma^{{PQ}\psi^R \right) (F + \hat F)_{{NPQR} \nonumber \\   &&\hspace{{-6mm}   -{{\sqrt{{2}\k \over 3456}   \epsilon^{{M_1 \cdots M_{{11}}F_{{M_1 \cdots M_4}F_{{M_5 \cdots M_8}A_{{M_9 M_{{10} M_{{11}} \,. \label{{11action}   \end{{eqnarray}     %   Here $F_{{MNPQ}$ is the curl (field strength) of $A_{{MNP}$  and $\hat F_{{MNPQ}$ is the supercovariant $F_{{MNPQ}$.  The spin connection is $\om_{{MAB}$ and is given by the solution to the field equation that results from varying it as an independent field.  $\hat \om_{{MAB}$ is the supercovariant connection given by % \be\label{{scc} \hat \om_{{MAB} = \om_{{MAB} + \frac{{1}{{8}\bar\psi^P\Gamma_{{PMABQ}\psi^Q \,. \ee % The $\Gamma$'s in \eq{{11action} are antisymmetrized products with unit weight, \be \Gamma^{{AB} = \frac{{1}{{2}(\Gamma^{{A}\Gamma^{{B} -\Gamma^{{B}\Gamma^{{A})) \,, \ee where $\Gamma^{{M} = e^M_A \Gamma^{{A}$ are the Dirac matrices which obey  $\{{\Gamma^{{A},\Gamma^{{B}\} = 2 \eta_{{AB}$.  The corresponding super-algebra in terms of the central charges $Z$ is \be\label{{11al} \{{Q_\a,Q_\b\} = (\G^M C)_{{\a \b} \, P_M + (\G^{{MN}C)_{{\a \b} Z_{{MN} 	+  (\G^{{MNPQR}C)_{{\a \b} Z_{{MNPQR} \,, \ee where each central charge term on the right corresponds to a $p$-brane. The $Q_\g$ are the supersymmetry generators and the $C$ matrices are real antisymmetric  matrices~\cite{{Kaku:1999yd}. %The above action has been identified with the low-energy limit of  %$M$-theory, and will therefore play an important role in our study %of early time cosmology.   This action will be the starting point for the model of Brane Gas Cosmology presented below.  As we have already  mentioned, supergravity seems to place an upper limit on the number of spacetime dimensions in our universe. Other considerations which  involve dynamical processes may in fact tell us why we are living in three spatial dimensions. In addition to eleven-dimensional $\N=1$ supergravity, the moduli space of  $M$-theory also contains the five consistent superstring theories. %----------------------------------------------------------------------- %\subsection{{Five dual theories, five dual universes} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- %\label{{pentaverse}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  %It is now generally believed that there are five-consistent superstring %theories in ten-dimensions.  These are the two theories we have already %discussed (Typed IIA and the heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ theories) along %with the Type I theory, the $SO(32)$ heterotic theory and the Type IIB theory. Because all of these theories are on equal footing (from a mathematical perspective), it is likely that valuable information may be gained by considering string cosmology in  every branch of the $M$-theory moduli space.  We will explore several such avenues and find interesting relations between them via the conjectured web of dualities which link the various branches of the $M$-oduli space. It is possible that cosmological considerations will provide clues as to  why the $M$-theory uni-verse is fragmented into the superstring penta-verse, leading to deeper insight into the nature of duality symmetries.   %Superstring theory is a theory of quantum gravity and %therefore should provide the correct description of physics in regions %of spacetime with high energies and large curvatures such as those %found in the very early universe.  It is therefore natural to try and %use superstring theory to answer questions about the evolution of the %Universe near the Planck time $t = 10^{{-43}$s. Recently, a new way to incorporate $M$-theory into cosmology was introduced in~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}.   The motivations for this scenario, are the problems of the standard Big Bang model (such as the presence of an initial singularity), the problems of string theory (such as the dimensionality problem), and are cosmological.   By cosmological we mean that we wish to stay in close contact with the standard Big Bang model, and therefore maintain the initial conditions of a hot, small and dense universe.  In our opinion, many other attempts to incorporate $M$-theory into cosmology, such as the existing formulations of brane world scenarios, are  often motivated from particle physics and make little connection with what we know about the origins of the universe.  They also suffer from the dimensionality problem mentioned above.  Why do the extra dimensions have the topologies they do? Why should a $3$-brane be favored over any other $p$-brane for our universe, and why should we live on one particular $3$-three brane versus another?    Besides keeping close ties with our beloved Big Bang cosmology we want to derive our model from the fundamental theory  of everything, namely $M$-theory.  The difficulty here is that we don't know what $M$-theory is.  We will therefore start with what we do know, the conjectured low energy limit of $M$-theory, which is the eleven-dimensional, $\N =1$ supergravity given by the action~(\ref{{11action}).  Dimensional reduction of this theory on $\mS^1$ results in Type IIA, $D=10$ supergravity which is the low energy limit of Type IIA superstring theory.   %The  %authors used IIA superstring theory, obtained from %compactification of $M$-theory on $\mS^1$~\cite{{Witten:1995ex}.~\footnote{{The %exact statement is that the strongly coupled behaviour of the Type IIA superstring %theory is identical to eleven-dimensional supergravity.}   The overall spatial manifold was assumed to be toroidal in all nine spatial dimensions.  The bosonic part of the low energy effective action for the background spacetime is \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{bulk} S_{{NS} \, = \, {{1 \over {{2 \kappa^2}} \int d^{{10}x \sqrt{{-G} e^{{-2 \Phi}  \bigl[ R &+& 4 G^{{\mu \nu} \nabla_\mu \Phi \nabla_\nu \Phi \nonumber \\ &-& {{1 \over {{12}} H_{{\mu \nu \alpha}H^{{\mu \nu \alpha} \bigr] \, , \end{{eqnarray} where we have included the Neveu-Schwarz - Neveu-Schwarz (NS-NS) fields only, and  ignored the terms bilinear in Ramond - Ramond (RR) fields.  Here $G$ is the determinant of the background metric  $G_{{\mu \nu}$, $\Phi$ is the dilaton, $H$ denotes the  field strength corresponding to the bulk antisymmetric tensor  field $B_{{\mu \nu}$, and $\kappa$ is determined by the 10-dimensional  Newton constant.  The supersymmetry algebra for the Type IIA theory is obtained by dimensional reduction of the eleven-dimensional super-algebra of~\eq{{11al}  and is given by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10al} \{{ Q_\a , Q_\b \}  \,=  \,(\G^M C)_{{\a \b} \, P_M + (\G_{{11}C)_{{\a \b}\, Z  	 \,+  \,(\G^{{M}\G_{{11}C)_{{\a \b} \, Z_{{M} 	 \,+ \, (\G^{{MN}C)_{{\a \b}\, Z_{{MN} 		\nonumber	\\ 	 \,+ \, (\G^{{MNPQ}\G_{{11}C)_{{\a \b}\, Z_{{MNPQ} 	 \,+ \,  (\G^{{MNPQR}C)_{{\a \b}\,\, Z_{{MNPQR} \,. \end{{eqnarray} %In~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}, the universe was assumed to be toroidal in all nine-spatial %dimensions and the bulk effective action was taken as~\eq{{bulk}.   The universe is assumed to be filled with a gas of the $p$-branes contained in the spectrum of  this theory.  Furthermore, the torus is assumed to start out small (string length scale) and with all fundamental degrees of freedom near thermal equilibrium.   $M$-theory contains a $3$-form tensor gauge field $B_{{\m\n\r}$ which corresponds to an electrically charged supermembrane (the $M2$-brane).  The $M5$-brane is a magnetically charged object.   $M$-theory also contains the graviton  (see, for example~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rr}).  The $M2$-brane and $M5$-brane can wrap around the $\mS^1$ in the compactification down to ten-dimensions, and hence produce the fundamental string and the  $D4$-brane of the Type IIA theory, respectively.  If the $M2$ and $M5$ branes do not wrap on the $\mS^1$ they produce the $D2$ and $5$-brane solutions in the IIA theory.  The graviton of $M$-theory obviously cannot wrap around the $\mS^1$ and correspond to $D0$-branes of the IIA theory.  Finally, we have the $D6$-brane, whose field strength is dual to that of the $D0$-brane and the $D8$-brane which may be viewed as a source for the  dilaton field~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rr}.~\footnote{{Non-string theorists may be interested to note that the $p$-brane spectrum of a theory  may simply be read off from the supersymmetry charges $Z_{{\m_1} , \dots Z_{{\m_p}$ present in the theory. From the algebras (\ref{{11al}) and (\ref{{10al}) we can easily identify the $p$-branes of eleven-dimensional supergravity and Type IIA superstring theory respectively.  The dual $q$-branes of the $p$-branes are found using the relation $p+q=D-4$.  For example, in ten-dimensions the dual of the electrically charged $0$-brane is the  magnetically charged $6$-brane.}  To summarise, the brane gas we are interested in contains $D$-branes of even dimension $0,2,4,6$ and $8$, and odd dimensional $p$-branes with $p = 1, 5$.  Therefore, the total action governing the dynamics of the system is the background action~(\eq{{bulk}) plus the action describing the fluctuations of all the branes in the theory.  The action of an individual $p$-brane is the Dirac-Born-Infeld action~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rq} \begin{{equation} \label{{brane} S_p \, = \, T_p \int d^{{p + 1} \zeta e^{{- \Phi} \sqrt{{- det(g_{{mn} + b_{{mn} + 2 \pi \alpha' F_{{mn})} \end{{equation} where \be\label{{tension}  T_p ={{{{\pi} \over {{g_s}} (4 \pi^2 \alpha')^{{-(p + 1)/2} \,, \ee is the tension of the  brane, $g_{{mn}$ is the induced metric on the brane, $b_{{mn}$ is the induced antisymmetric tensor field, and $F_{{mn}$ is the field strength tensor of gauge fields $A_m$ living on the brane.~\footnote{{From \eq{{tension} we see that all of the branes in this scenario have {{\it positive} tensions.} The constant $\alpha' \sim l_{{st}^2$  is given by the string length scale $l_{{st}$, and $g_s$ is  the string coupling parameter. The total action is the sum of the  bulk action (\ref{{bulk}) and the sum of all of the brane actions (\ref{{brane}), each coupled as a delta function source (a delta function in the directions transverse to the brane) to the 10-dimensional action.   The induced metric on the brane $g_{{mn}$, with indices $m,n,...$ denoting space-time dimensions parallel to the brane, is determined by the background metric $G_{{\mu \nu}$ and by scalar fields $\phi_i$ living on the brane (with indices $i,j,...$ denoting dimensions transverse to the brane) which describe the fluctuations of the brane in the transverse directions: \begin{{equation} \label{{indmet} g_{{mn} \, = \, G_{{mn} + G_{{ij} \partial_m \phi_i \partial_n \phi_j + G_{{in} \partial_m \phi_i \, . \end{{equation} The induced antisymmetric tensor field is \begin{{equation} \label{{indten} b_{{mn} \, = \, B_{{mn} + B_{{ij} \partial_m \phi_i \partial_n \phi_j + B_{{i[n} \partial_{{m]} \phi_i \, . \end{{equation} In addition, \begin{{equation} F_{{mn} \, = \, \partial_{{[m} A_{{n]} \, . \end{{equation}  The evolution of the system described above, with Friedman-Robertson-Walker background $G_{{\mu \nu} \, = \, a(\eta)^2 diag(-1, 1, ..., 1)$, was analyzed in~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv} and discussed in greater detail in~\cite{{Brandenberger:2001kj}.  The results  were that the winding $p$-branes introduced a confining potential for the scale factor $a(\eta)$ implying that these states tend to \it prevent \rm the universe from expanding~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv,Tseytlin:1992xk}.  A summary of the evolution of the universe according to the Brane Gas model is the following. %~\footnote{{The reader is encouraged to see~\cite{{Brandenberger:2001kj}  %for a detailed analysis of the cosmological evolution.}   The universe starts out small, hot and dense, toroidal in all nine-spatial dimensions and filled with a gas of $p$-branes.  The $p$-branes exhibit various behaviors.  They may wrap around the cycles of the torus (winding modes), they can have a center-of-mass motion along the cycles (momentum modes) or they may simply fluctuate in the bulk space  (oscillatory modes).  By symmetry, we assume that there are equal numbers of winding and anti-winding modes. When a winding mode and an anti-winding mode interact they unwind and form a loop in the bulk spacetime.  As the universe tries to expand, the winding modes become  heavy and halt the expansion.  Spatial dimensions can only dynamically decompactify if the winding modes disappear.    A simple counting argument demonstrates that a $p$-brane winding mode and a $p$-brane  anti-winding mode are likely to interact in at most $2p+1$  dimensions.~\footnote{{For example, consider two particles (0-branes) moving through a space of dimension $d$.  These particles will definitely interact (assuming the space is periodic) if $d=1$, whereas they probably will not find each other in a space with $d>1$.} In $d = 9$ spatial dimensions, there are no obstacles preventing the disappearance  of $p=8, 6, 5$ and $p=4$ winding modes, whereas the lower dimensional brane  winding modes will allow a hierarchy of dimensions to become large.   For volumes large compared to the string volume, the  $p$-branes with the largest value of $p$ carry the most energy (see \eq{{pbrane}), and therefore they will have an important effect first.  The 2-branes will unwind in $2(2)+1=5$ spatial dimensions allowing these dimensions to become large.  Within this distinguished $\mT^5$, the 1-brane winding modes  will only allow a $\mT^3$ subspace to become large. Hence the above model provides a dynamical decompactification mechanism which results in a macroscopic, $3$-dimensional universe, potentially solving the dimensionality problem discussed in section~\ref{{dimp}.  We have reiterated the general arguments of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv} in order to point out the special way in which the dimensional hierarchy is made manifest.  This decomposition into products of spaces exhibiting these particular dimensionalities will be of interest to us in the following sections.  A careful counting of dimensions leads to the resulting manifold \be\label{{manif} \mathbf{{\M}^{{10}_{{IIA} = \mS^1 \times \mT^4 \times \mT^2 \times \mT^3 \,, \ee where the $\mS^1$ comes from the original compactification of $M$-theory and the hierarchy of tori are generated by the self-annihilation of $p=2$ and $p=1$ branes as described above.   Note that the compact dimensions remain compact due to remnant winding states. For example, the $\mT^2$ remains small due to string winding modes which cannot self-annihilate once the $\mT^3$ has grown large. (These remnant winding modes have coordinates in the large $\mT^3$ as well.) However, one issue which remains a concern is the stability of the radius of the compact dimensions to inhomogeneities as a function of the three coordinates $x_i$; $i = 1, 2, 3$ corresponding to the large spatial dimensions. The separation in $x_i$ between the branes wrapping the  small tori is increasing, and there appears to be no mechanism to keep the ``internal" dimensions from expanding inhomogeneously in $x_i$ \it between \rm the branes. A simple but unsatisfactory solution, is to invoke a non-perturbative effect similar to what is needed to stabilize the dilaton at late times, namely to postulate a potential which will stabilize the moduli  uniformly in $x_i$ (after the winding modes around the $x_i$ directions have disappeared). Work on a possible solution within the context of the framework presented here is in progress.~\footnote{{We  thank R. Brandenberger and D. Lowe for discussions on this issue.}  From \eq{{manif} it appears that the universe may have undergone a phase during which physics was described by an effective six-dimensional theory.  It is tempting to draw a relation between this theory and the scenario of~\cite{{Arkani-Hamed:1998rs,Antoniadis:1998ig}. However, since the only scale in the theory is the string scale it seems unlikely that the extra dimensions are large enough to solve the hierarchy problem.  This will be studied in a future publication. %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \section{{Brane gases on K3 and Calabi-Yau manifolds} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{bgk3}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  The greatest deficiency of the brane gas model is its current lack of contact with particle physics.   Part of this problem is the fact that the compactification was carried out  on a toroidal manifold which possesses trivial holonomy.   Because of this it is impossible to reproduce a realistic model of particle physics (consistent with string theory), and hence the resulting cosmological model cannot be a realistic one.   We will now try to generalise the model of brane gas cosmology to $K3$ and, via duality, to Calabi-Yau three-folds. %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsection{{Brane gases and heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ strings} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{bghet}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  The cosmological scenario of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv} was developed within the context of $M$-theory on $\mS^1$ which gives Type IIA supersting theory in ten-dimensions.  Let us begin by considering the same scenario in a different branch of the $M$-theory moduli space, one which is  more easily connected to realistic particle physics, the $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string theory.  Like the Type IIA string, the $E_8 \times E_8$ theory can be obtained directly from eleven-dimensional  $M$-theory~\cite{{Horava:1996qa}.   The specific conjecture is that strongly coupled $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic superstring theory is equivalent to $M$-theory on the orbifold  $\mS^1/\mZ_2 \times \mR^{{10}$~\cite{{Horava:1996qa}.  To maintain the initial conditions of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}, we will assume that the nine-spatial dimensions are periodically identified so that the full ten-dimensional spatial manifold is \be \M_{{het}^{{10} = \mS^1/\mZ_2 \times \mT^9 \,, \ee where the $\mS^1/\mZ_2$ is from the initial compactification of eleven-dimensional $M$-theory. The ten-dimensional low energy effective action  is \be \label{{hetaction} S_{{het}(g,A,\Phi,\dots) = \frac{{1}{{2\k^2} \int d^{{10}x \sqrt{{-g} \, e^{{-2 \Phi}\,  \bigl[\, R(g) + 4(\nabla \Phi)^2 - \frac{{1}{{3} H^2 + \frac{{\a'}{{30} T\!r \, F^2_A + \cdots \,\big] \,, \ee for a metric $g$ of signature $(-,+,\cdots,+)$, a connection $A$ and the dilaton $\Phi$.  The fields denoted by the ``$\cdots$'' have been omitted due to their irrelevance to the current topic of interest.  They include the supersymmetric partners of the fields listed,  for example; the dilatino, the gravitino and the gaugino.      Among the fundamental constituents of the heterotic theory are 2-dimensional objects (from the $M2$-brane in the eleven-dimensional theory) and strings.  As described in section~\ref{{bgc}, these $p =2$ and $p=1$ dimensional objects will be the only winding modes which are important for the decompactification of a nine-dimensional space.  The hierarchy in the sizes of the growing dimensions, will therefore be the same as that presented in section~\ref{{bgc} formulated within the context of Type IIA string theory (see~\eq{{manif}).   The entire ten-dimensional manifold decomposes into \be\label{{manhet} \mathbf{{\M}^{{10}_{{het} = \mS^1/\mZ_2 \times \mT^4 \times \mT^2 \times \mT^3 \,. \ee Note, that \it before \rm the string winding modes have annihilated the space will look like $\M^{{10} = \mS^1/\mZ_2 \times \mT^4 \times \mT^5$ which may be approximated by the heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ theory compactified on $\mT^4$.   Let us take a moment to examine this theory in more detail. %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsubsection{{\it Heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ on $\mT^4$} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{hett4}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  The six-dimensional heterotic theory, achieved by dimensional reduction of the action (\ref{{hetaction}), is \be \label{{het6} S_{{\mT^4}^{{het} = \frac{{1}{{2\k_6^2} \int d^{{6}x \sqrt{{-g_6} \, e^{{-2 \Phi_6}\,  \bigl[\, R + 4(\nabla \Phi)^2 - \frac{{1}{{2} |\tilde H_3|^2 -  \frac{{\k^2_6}{{2g^2_6}\,|F_2^2| \,\big] \,, \ee where the six-dimensional  dilaton is dependent on the internal space volume and  $\Phi$:~\footnote{{Here we use the notation of~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rr}.} \be e^{{-2 \Phi_6} = V e^{{-2 \Phi} \,. \ee The resulting theory is an $\N = 2$, non-chiral theory.  %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  The decomposition of~\eq{{manhet} is nearly identical to the  decomposition of $\mathbf{{\M}^{{10}_{{IIA}$ in \eq{{manif}.  Considering these similarities, one is tempted to suspect a relation between the two superstring theories, Type IIA and heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$. Of course, such a duality exists and is well  known~\cite{{Witten:1995ex,Hull:1995ys}.  Let us return to this issue after briefly introducing the surface $K3$ which will play a key role is our discussion of duality.  \subsubsection{{$K3$ surfaces} There are only two Ricci-flat, K\"{{a}hler manifolds in four-dimensions. One we have already discussed is the torus $\mT^4$ and the other is the surface $K3$.~\footnote{{By ``surface'' we mean two complex dimensions.}   The surface $K3$ is a Calabi-Yau manifold but it has only two complex dimensions ($d=4$ real dimensions) and $SU(2)$ holonomy.  This surface has appeared extensively in the literature and plays a paramount role in the analysis of string duality symmetries. An extensive introduction to the properties of $K3$ can be found  in~\cite{{Aspinwall:1996mn}.    Although no explicit construction of the metric on $K3$ has been found~\cite{{Yau:1978}, it is possible to construct the manifold from an orbifold of $\mT^4$~\cite{{Page:1978zu}.  One starts by identifying coordinates of $\mT^4$, $x^i \sim x^i + 2\pi$ and then making the identification $x^i \sim -x^i$, where $x^i \in \mR^4$. This will lead to $16$ fixed points located at $x^i = \pi n$, where $n \in \mZ$.  By removing the points as four-spheres and then  filling the $16$ resulting holes with four-dimensional Eguchi-Hanson instantons, it is possible to achieve an approximation to the smooth Ricci-flat $K3$ manifold.~\footnote{{Note that any two $K3$'s are diffeomorphic to each other, and therefore we can produce all of the topological invariants of $K3$ from just one example.} This approximation becomes more and more precise in the limit as the radius of the instantons approaches zero~\cite{{Lu:1999xt}. For the purposes of this paper we may consider $K3$ as  \be\label{{k3t} K3 \simeq \mT^4/\mZ_2 \,. \ee %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsubsection{{\it Heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ and Type IIA} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{e82a}   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- Now consider ``moving'' the $\mZ_2$ symmetry in \eq{{manhet} from the $\mS^1$ to the $\mT^4$.  We then have the structure \be\label{{IIAk3} \mathbf{{\M}^{{10}_{{} = \mS^1 \times \mT^4/\mZ_2 \times \mT^2 \times \mT^3 \,. \ee From the full, eleven-dimensional perspective the \eq{{IIAk3} looks like $M$-theory compactified on $\mS^1 \times K3$ (recall~\eq{{k3t}), which  is Type IIA string theory compactified on $K3$.  In fact, this \it gives \rm the duality between this theory and the one presented in section~\ref{{hett4}.    Type IIA superstring theory compactified on $K3$ is dual to heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ superstring theory compactified on $\mT^4$~\cite{{Witten:1995ex,Hull:1995ys}.  The duality seems almost obvious when one considers the manifolds (\ref{{IIAk3}) and (\ref{{manhet}), and recalls the ability of $K3$ compactifications to break supersymmetry. Because the heterotic theory has less supersymmetry then the IIA theory, some of the supersymmetries of the IIA theory must be broken before any identification between the two theories can be made.  A $\mT^4$ compactification of the IIA theory is a $\N=4$ theory. As discussed above, the properties of $K3$ reduce the supersymmetry of the compactified IIA theory down to $\N = 2$, which is the number of supersymmetries in the theory obtained by compactification of the heterotic string on $\mT^4$.  These cosmological considerations seem to provide further evidence for the conjectured duality. %a nice example of how string theory and cosmology can compliment one another. To make this equivalence more transparent let us consider the theory obtained from compactification of Type IIA on $K3$, and then compare this to our analysis of the heterotic string on $\mT^4$ (section~\ref{{hett4}). %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsection{{Type IIA on $K3$} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{IIAonk3}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  The simplest compactification to four-dimensions other than the torus is the surface $K3$ (having $SU(2)$ holonomy) along with a cartesian product of $\mT^2$.  We have mentioned that $K3$ is a very special surface within the context of string theory.  In the next few sections we continue to investigate the interesting physics that arises in $K3$ compactifications and consider some of the implications this surface has on string cosmology. %We have already considered compactifications of IIA strings on  %and the heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ theory on $K3$.  Our first obstacle to generalising the brane gas model of cosmology to $K3$ and Calabi-Yau spaces  is the absence of one-cycles on both of these objects.~\footnote{{For $K3$ surfaces and phenomenologically interesting Calabi-Yau spaces the first Betti  number vanishes, $b_1 =0$ (see e.g. \cite{{Aspinwall:1996mn,Kaku:1999yd}).} At first glance the arguments of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv} seem to rely on the presence of one-cycles in the compactified dimensions.  We will show that a more careful consideration demonstrates that this is not necessarily the case.   The reduction of Type IIA theory on $K3$, which is suggested by the \eq{{IIAk3}, leads to the following action \be \label{{IIAk3ac} S^{{IIA}_{{K3} = \frac{{1}{{2\k_6^2} \int d^{{6}x \sqrt{{-g_6} \, e^{{-2 \Phi_6}\,  \bigl[\, R + 4(\nabla \Phi)^2 - \frac{{1}{{2} e^{{2 \Phi_6}|\tilde H_3|^2 -  \frac{{\k^2_6}{{2g^2_6}\,|F_2^2| \,\big] \,. \ee Notice that this action can be transformed into (\ref{{het6}) by the conformal transformation \be g_{{\m\n} \rightarrow e^{{2 \Phi_6} g_{{\m\n} \,, \ee along with the reflection  \be\label{{refl} \Phi_6 \rightarrow - \Phi_6 \,. \ee Here, $\tilde H_3 \rightarrow e^{{2 \Phi_6} *_6 \tilde H_3$, where  $ *_6 $ results from the factorization of the ten-dimensional $*$ by $*_{{10} = *_6 *_4$~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rr}.  Because of the  identification of $\Phi_6 \rightarrow - \Phi_6$, the conjectured duality maps a strongly coupled theory to a weakly coupled theory.  The IIA theory on $K3$ contains the IIA string formed by the wrapping of $M2$-branes on the $\mS^1$ from the compactification of $M$-theory (as described in section~\ref{{bgc}).  There is another string in this theory however, obtained by wrapping an $M5$-branes around the entire four-dimensional $K3$.  This is exactly the heterotic string~\cite{{Cherkis:1997bx}.    The two theories (\ref{{IIAk3ac}) and (\ref{{het6}) have the same low energy supergravity description~\cite{{Hull:1995ys}, which is an $\N =2$  supergravity coupled to abelian super-Yang-Mills multiplets.  This results in $80$ scalar fields which span the moduli  space of vacua.~\footnote{{At first glance, one may be concerned that the Type IIA theory lacks the $E_8 \times E_8$ Yang-Mills fields of the heterotic string.  This is not a problem however, since the moduli space of the IIA theory is enhanced via the  compactification onto $K3$, and the resulting theory has the expected $80$ scalar fields mentioned above~\cite{{Kaku:1999yd,Aspinwall:1996mn}.}   %To see this, consider the following. %The moduli space of $K3$ is isomorphic to %\be\label{{modulik3} %\frac{{SO(19,3,\mR)}{{SO(19,\mR) \times SO(3,\mR)} \times \mR^+ %\,, %\ee %which is $3 \times 19 = 57$ dimensional space, plus one additional %dimension for the volume of the space.  Hence, the ten-dimensional %metric $g_{{\m\n}$ can be decomposed into a six-dimensional metric %plus $58$ scalar fields corresponding to the moduli of  %$K3$~\cite{{Kaku:1999yd,Aspinwall:1996mn}.   %From this, %we find that the IIA theory on $K3$ has $58+22 =80$ scalar fields.   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsubsection{{\it $IIA$ brane gas on $K3$} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{iiabg}   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- Let us consider a simple modification to the brane gas model  summarised in section~\ref{{bgc}.  The background will be $M$-theory on the manifold \be\label{{mfold} \M = \mS^1 \times K3 \times \mT^5 \,, \ee or Type IIA string theory in a toroidal universe, compactified on $K3$. The gas of branes are the branes of the Type IIA theory.    Recall that string winding modes will act like rubber bands wrapped  around the cycles of the toroidal universe and hence, their existence tends to prevent the universe from expanding.  Branes of larger dimension (greater values of $p$) have a similar behavior as we demonstrate below, but the energies in these branes is greater than the energy in the string winding modes, and therefore they have an important effect on the dynamics of the universe first.  We will show that such winding branes may wrap around cycles of $K3$ and prevent it from expanding.   The energy of a $p$-brane winding mode in an FRW universe with scale factor $a(\eta)$   can be calculated from the  action~(\ref{{brane}), and is given by \be\label{{pbrane} E_p(a) \simeq T_p \, a(\eta)^p \,, \ee where $\eta$ is conformal time  and $T_p$ is the tension of the $p$-brane given by \eq{{tension}.  From this we see that the energy of a $p$-brane winding mode increases with $p$.  The ratio of the energy in a $(p+1)$-brane winding mode to a $p$-brane winding mode in this background is \be\label{{pbraneen} \frac{{E_{{(p+1)}}{{E_p} \simeq (4\pi^2\alpha')^{{-1/2} \, a(\eta) \,. \ee Note that there is no $p$ dependence in this equation. Equation~(\ref{{pbrane}) is the energy of a $p$-brane wrapped around a one-cycle.  This is the correct expression to use when calculating the energy in winding modes wrapped around the toroidal pieces of the manifold $\M$ in \eq{{mfold}.    We have mentioned above that $K3$ does not posses one-cycles and therefore strings cannot wrap around this portion of the manifold and prevent it from expanding. However, $K3$ does have Betti number $b_2 = 22$ (twenty-two harmonic two-forms) and therefore contains $22$ two-cycles, which $p > 1$ branes can wrap around. Note that the torus $\mT^5$ also contains  ($b_2 = 10$) two cycles.    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%cut in this version%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %Such a winding state produces %a ($p-2$)-brane, which has less energy then the same %$p$-brane would if it were wrapped around a one-cycle of the torus.   %For example, a $5$-brane wrapped %around a two-cycle of the internal $K3$ space looks like a $3$-brane, %and therefore has less energy then a $5$-brane wrapped around %a one-cycle of the torus, which looks like a $4$-brane.   %This point is critical to the arguments which follow. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% For our cosmological considerations we take the initial state of the universe  to be the same as that described in section~\ref{{bgc}, except for the topology of the space which is now given by (in the $D=10$ dimensional string description) $K3 \times \mT^5$.  Recall that the highest dimensional brane winding modes have an effect on the dynamics first, since they have the largest energy and therefore fall out of equilibrium first. As described in section~\ref{{bgc}, brane winding modes for $p=8,6,5,4$ branes do not have an effect on the decompactification process.   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%new stuff%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The first branes to have an effect are the $2$-brane winding modes.   However, we shall assume that the $2$-branes which are wrapped around the two-cycles of the $\mT^5$ are heavier than the $2$-branes which are wrapped around the two-cycles of the $K3$; hence, they will fall out of thermal equilibrium and consequently effect  the dynamics of the decompactification first. A plausibility argument for this assumption goes as follows: recall that the energy of a membrane scales with its area.  Now let us consider the topological structure of the two-cycles of $K3$ and $\mT^5$.  A theorem familiar to many  mathematicians states that any compact connected surface with boundary is toplogically equivalent to a sphere ($\mS^2$), the connected sum of $n$ tori  ($\mT^2 \# \, \cdots \# \, \mT^2$) , or the connected sum of $n$ projective planes ($\mR\mP^2 \,\# \cdots \# \, \mR\mP^2$),  with a finite number of discs removed.~\footnote{{For readers not familiar with the term, the \it connected sum \rm of the surfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$ is defined by removing a small disc from each of $S_1$ and $S_2$, and gluing the boundary circles of these discs together to form a new surface $S_1 \# S_2$.}  Therefore, the two-cycles under consideration  must have one of the above mentioned topological structures.  Since neither  $K3$ nor $\mT^5$ contain a m\"{{o}bius band, we may rule out any topological structure containing the real projective plane $\mR\mP^2$ which is non-orientable.  Let us first consider the topology of the two-cycles in $\mT^5$.  The easiest way to determine their topological structure is to consider the elementary case of $\mT^2$.  In the torus, there is only $b_2(\mT^2) = 1$ two-cycle. Clearly, this two-cycle is just the entire $\mT^2$.   Note that this two-cycle is made up of $b_1(\mT^2) = 2$ one-cycles.  From this we can  easily generalize to the case of $\mT^5$, by considering the number of ways the $\mS^1$'s in $\mT^5$ can hook up to form two-cycles.  There are five $\mS^1$'s in $\mT^5$ and hence ${{}_5C_2 = 10$ \it toroidal \rm two-cycles in the space.  Because this agrees with  the calculation of the Betti number $b_2(\mT^5) = 10$, we know we have taken into account all of the two-cycles.  Now consider the two-cycles in $K3$.  Since $K3$ has no one-cycles ($b_1(K3)=0$) and hence no $\mS^1$'s,  it is impossible for the two-cycles in $K3$ to have $\mT^2 = \mS^1 \times \mS^1$ topology.   Hence the $b_2 = 22$ two-cycles in $K3$ must be topologicaly equivalent to \it spheres \rm. Because the two-cycles of $K3$ and $\mT^5$ differ in their topological structure membranes will have to wrap differently on the distinct types of two-cycles of  the product manifold $K3 \times \mT^5$.  Recall in the inital conditions of our  cosmological model we assumed all  radii $r_i$ start out  on equal footing, near the string length scale $r_i \approx R_{{st}$, where  $i = 1,\dots,9$.  A membrane wrapped around a spherical two-cycle in the $K3$  subspace will have energy propotional to its surface area $\mathcal{{E}_{{S^2} \propto 4 \pi R_{{st}^2$. The same membrane wrapped around a toroidal two-cycle of the $\mT^5$ would have energy $\mathcal{{E}_{{T^2} \propto 4 \pi^2 R_{{st}^2$.  Hence, the two-branes wrapped around two-cycles of the $\mT^5$ will (on average) be heavier then the two-branes wrapped around two-cycles of the $K3$ by a factor of $\pi$.  In short, for a $2$-brane in the space $K3 \times \mT^5$ it is energetically more favorable to wrap around one of the $22$ two-cycles of the $K3$ then to wrap around one of the $10$ two-cycles of the $\mT^5$ (when all radii are equal). We come to the conclusion that it is probable that the wrapped $2$-branes on $\mT^5$ will fall out of thermal equilibrium before the wrapped $2$-branes on $K3$ and allow the $\mT^5$ to grow.  This argument is only a plausibility argument due to our assumptions about initial conditions and setting all radii to be near the string scale.  However, we believe that such initial conditions are well motivated given the cosmological setting of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}.  One possibility then (arguably the most probable and certainly the most  desirable from the viewpoint of a realistic model) is that the interaction of winding and antiwinding $2$-branes causes the $\mT^5$ subspace to grow (since $2(2) + 1 =5$).~\footnote{{ In order to get a very large gauge group, e.g. $E_8 \times E_8 \times SU(2)^4 \times U(1)^4$ it is probably necessary for the $K3$ space to be very small (with volume of order one in units of $(\alpha')^2$) and singular~\cite{{Aspinwall:1996mn}.}   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% After that, there is no way for the $2$-branes wrapping the $K3$ space to self-annihilate (by the old dimension counting argument) since these branes have coordinates (fluctuations) in the $\mT^5$ space as well as in the $K3$. This compact space remains small due to these remnant winding  states.~\footnote{{Note that similar arguments should apply to Calabi-Yau threefolds.} Within the $\mT^5$ the string winding mode self-annihilation causes a  $\mT^3$ torus to grow large.  The final result (nearly the same as in the $\mT^9$ compactification of section~\ref{{bgc}) is, \be \M^{{9} = K3 \times \mT^2 \times \mT^3 \,. \ee The winding modes around the $\mT^3$ completely vanish~\cite{{Brandenberger:2001kj} and hence the $\mT^3$ topology now looks like $\mR^3$. The $\mT^2$ remains small due to remnant string winding modes which cannot self-annihilate once the $\mT^3$ has grown large. (Note that these winding modes have coordinates in the large $\mT^3$ as well.)   Because there is only one scale in the theory (the string scale) it seems unlikely that the $\mT^2$ subspace will be much larger than the $K3$ space.  In fact, the remnant winding states may cause the $\mT^2$ to shrink back down to the string scale.  This implies that the  four-dimensional theory is Type IIA string theory compactified on $K3 \times \mT^2$.~\footnote{{A full treatment of the IIA string theory compactified on $K3 \times \mT^2$ is given in~\cite{{Kiritsis:1998hj}.  A detailed analysis of the six-dimensional theory which describes this shrinking $\mT^5$ fracturing into an expanding $\mT^3$ and shrinking $\mT^2$ is underway.  It appears that the $\mT^3$ space makes a graceful exit from a contracting phase into an expanding phase, perhaps along the lines  of~\cite{{DeRisi:2001ed}.}  In this theory, branes with  $p<5$ can wrap around the two-cycles of the $K3$, producing monopole winding states on $\mT^2$.  The final four-dimensional field theory has $\N=4$ supersymmetry and is identical to the low-energy field theory description of the heterotic string on $\mT^6$~\cite{{Hull:1995ys}.  The $K3$ compactification of IIA string theory presented above is an improvement over the trivial toroidal compactification of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}, in the sense that $K3$ has holonomy $SU(2)$ and we have reduced the number of supersymmetries by half (from $\N=8$ to $\N=4$).  Of course, the only physically relevant case is that of $D=4$, $\N = 1$.  Alas, we do not construct such a theory in this paper but we will produce a $D=4$, $\N = 2$ theory in what follows. %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsubsection{{\it $E_8 \times E_8$ brane gas on $K3$} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{e8bg}   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- One way to get an $\N = 2$ theory in four-dimensions is to compactify the heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ string on a complex three-fold with $SU(2)$ holonomy.  All such manifolds are of the form $K3 \times \mT^2$ (and its quotients)~\cite{{Aspinwall:1996mn}.  Once again, we find that  a brane gas within the context of heterotic string theory on a nine-dimensional manifold $K3 \times \mT^5$, is governed by the same arguments presented in section~\ref{{bgc} (also see section~\ref{{e82a}).  The symmetry group decomposes as  \be SO(1,9) \supset SO(1,5) + SO(4) \simeq SO(1,5) + SU(2) + SU(2) \,, \ee and we have an $\N=1$ theory in six-dimensions. The $2$-branes  allow the $\mT^5$ submanifold to grow and then within the $\mT^5$  the strings allow a $\mT^3$ space to grow large.  From the $D = 11$ $M$-theory point of view, the full $d=10$ manifold is \be \mathbf{{\M}^{{10}_{{\mbox{{\it \scriptsize het on}\, K3} =  \mS^1/\mZ_2 \times K3 \times \mT^2 \times \mT^3 \,, \ee which gives an $\N = 2$ theory in $D=4$. %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsection{{Brane gases on Calabi-Yau manifolds} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{bgcy}   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- A realistic construction of our universe based on superstring theory requires compactification onto spaces of nontrivial topology.  If one chooses to compactify on a manifold, then particle physics requires that this be a Calabi-Yau threefold $\mX$.~\footnote{{If one is willing to allow the compactified space to have  singularities then it is possible to generate realistic particle physics models from orbifold compactifications.}  The first difficulty we encounter when considering Brane Gas Cosmology and Calabi-Yau compactifications with $SU(3)$ holonomy is the absence of one-cycles in $\mX$ ($b_1(\mX) =0$).  In general, such manifolds do have higher dimensional $p$-cycles, and we may employ the same arguments given in our discussion of $K3$ to show that the absence of one-cycles may not pose a problem for the cosmological model  (see section~\ref{{iiabg}).  In fact, some properties of Calabi-Yau three-folds are easier to understand within our context then the $K3$ surface. In a Calabi-Yau three-fold $\mX$ the K\"{{a}hler moduli parameterize the relative resizing of the two-cycles (and the four-dimensional subspaces representing their dual four-cycles).  Thus the K\"{{a}hler moduli give the overall scale of the manifold; i.e. fluctuations of these moduli correspond to fluctuations in the volume of the space.  Deformations of the complex structure moduli correspond to changing the ``shape'' of the manifold~\cite{{Greene:1996cy}.  For $d=3$ complex manifolds with exactly $SU(3)$ holonomy,  the fermion zero modes (which are harmonic $(0,n)$ forms) must be covariantly constant. This implies vanishing of the Hodge numbers $h^{{2,0} = h^{{0,2}=0$.  If this condition is satisfied then the entire moduli structure of $\mX$ becomes a local product of the complex structure moduli and the K\"{{a}hler moduli.  Deformations in these two types of structure moduli may then be studied independently.  In the complex two-fold $K3$, $h^{{2,0}=1$.  The complex and  K\"{{a}hler moduli are degenerate and deformations of these structures must be  studied simultaneously~\cite{{Aspinwall:1994rg}.  The product structure of the moduli on $\mX$ may simplify our study considerably.  For example, if we choose $\mX$ with only one  K\"{{a}hler class then all even dimensional submanifolds in $\mX$ will scale with a \it single \rm parameter (or the appropriate power thereof). We may imagine then the possibility of constraining  only one two-cycle (perhaps with a winding brane) and thereby ``fix'' all other two-cycles in $\mX$.~\footnote{{We thank B.~Greene for pointing this out. After the completion  of this work a related paper appeared in~\cite{{Easther:2002mi}.}  The second difficulty (which will prevent us from achieving a realistic $N=1$, $D=4$ cosmological theory) is that it is not clear how the manifold $\M^9$, resulting from a direct compactification on $\mX$, will decompose. Within the context of the brane gas model, all the manifolds $\M_i$ decompose into products of a space and a five-dimensional torus due to the $2$-brane winding modes (see, for example \eq{{mfold}).   In the case of a direct compactification onto $\mX$, the full ten-dimensional manifold is \be \M = \mM^1 \times {{\mX} \times \mT^3 \,, \ee where $\mM^1$ is either $\mS^1$ (for the Type IIA theory) or $\mS^1/\mZ_2 $ (for the $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string).  It is not clear what the five-dimensional subspace (analogous to the $\mT^5$ mentioned above) will be.  Despite this dilemma, there is good reason to believe that such a compactification should somehow be compatible with the brane gas picture.  The motivation for this belief results from our lessons about dual $\N=4$ theories presented  in section~\ref{{iiabg}.   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsubsection{{\it $IIA$ brane gas on a Calabi-Yau threefold} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{iiacy}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  In addition to the discussion of section~\ref{{e8bg}, a second way to construct an $\N =2$ theory in $D=4$ is to consider a Type II theory compactified on a Calabi Yau three-fold $\mX$, which is a complex manifold with holonomy $SU(3)$.  In this section we will provide an existence proof of the compatibility of Calabi-Yau manifolds and the model of Brane Gas Cosmology.    We would like to find a duality between the $\N=2$ theories described here, and in section~\ref{{e8bg}.  Such a duality exists~\cite{{Kachru:1995wm,Ferrara:1995yx}: for a certain type of Calabi-Yau three-fold ${{\mX}$ with $SU(3)$ holonomy,  Type II theories compactified on ${{\mX}$ are dual to heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ on $K3 \times \mT^2$.  We will not investigate this duality in detail and the interested reader should see, for example~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rr,Aspinwall:1996mn}.   Many Calabi-Yau manifolds are $K3$ \it fibrations\rm, i.e. locally a product of $K3$ with a two-dimensional manifold.  That is, the manifold $\mX$ is a fibration where the generic fiber is a $K3$ surface.  In general, the conformal field theories (CFTs) arising from compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds have very different geometric descriptions in terms of the K\"{{a}hler and complex structure moduli. This brings us to a short discussion of \it mirror  manifolds \rm~\cite{{Greene:1996cy}.~\footnote{{Much of our discussion on this subject will ``reflect'' Polchinski's book~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rr}.} It appears that certain Calabi-Yau manifolds come in mirror pairs, $\M$ and $\W$ where the conformal field theory descriptions of the two manifolds are isomorphic (related by $H \rightarrow -H$) but certain geometric properties are reversed.  A geometric correspondence between two such manifolds is known for at least one type of such mirror pairs. These are related to so called Gepner models, for which a relation between mirrors is \be \W = \M/\Gamma \,, \ee where $\Gamma$ is some subgroup of the global symmetry group that commutes with the spacetime supersymmetry group.  This ``twisting'' by  $\Gamma$ results in orbifold singularities in the mirror space $\W$. Note that in the above compactification of $E_8 \times E_8$ on $K3$, the $K3$ surface is itself a fibration with generic fiber given by a $\mT^2$. Because of this duality between IIA on a Calabi-Yau manifold and the  heterotic string on $K3 \times \mT^2$, we suspect that BGC is compatible with Calabi-Yau compactifications.  Specifically, the brane gas cosmology of  section~\ref{{e8bg} should be dual to a brane gas cosmology on a Calabi-Yau three-fold.   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsection{{Type IIB brane gases} %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{iibbg}   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Type IIB theory is a theory with chiral $\N = 2$ supersymmetry.  It  is not clear how to derive this theory from an eleven-dimensional supergravity theory and therefore its connection to $M$-theory is not as transparent as that of the Type IIA and heterotic theories.  Nevertheless, the Type IIB theory occupies a space in the $M$-theory moduli space, and therefore we should consider BGC within the context of the IIB theory.  For simplicity and to make a comparison with~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv} we consider the IIB brane gas in a toroidal background $\mT^9$. However, our general statements concerning IIA on $K3$ also apply to  the IIB theory. The algebra for the Type IIB superstring, which has two chiral spinors $Q^i_\a$ is \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{10alb} \{{ Q^i_\a , Q^i_\b \}  \,=  \, \delta^{{ij}(\cP \G^M C)_{{\a \b} \, P_M  	+ (\cP \G^{{M}C)_{{\a \b}\, \tilde Z^{{ij}_M  	 \,+  \,\epsilon^{{ij}(\cP\G^{{MNP}C)_{{\a \b} \, Z_{{MNP} \nonumber	\\ 	 \,+ \, \delta^{{ij}(\cP\G^{{MNPQR}C)_{{\a \b}\, Z^+_{{MNPQR} 	 \,+ \, (\cP\G^{{MNPQR}C)_{{\a \b}\,\tilde Z^{{+ij}_{{MNPQR} \,, \end{{eqnarray} where $\cP$ is a chiral projection operator and the tilde refers to traceless $SO(2)$ tensors~\cite{{Kaku:1999yd}. From the algebra we see that this theory contains odd-dimensional BPS states which are $Dp$-branes with $p = 1,3,5,\dots$.  Following our usual arguments, we find that the $p=1$ and $p=3$ winding branes will have an effect on the decompactification dynamics of the nine-dimensional universe.  The $3$-branes allow a $\mT^7$ subspace to become large and then  the string winding modes (as usual) result in a $\mT^3$ large sub-subspace.   The overall nine-dimensional manifold $\M^9$ evolves into \be\label{{miib} \M^9_{{IIB} = \mT^2 \times \mT^4 \times \mT^3 \,. \ee  By comparing \eq{{miib} with the corresponding decomposition within the context of the IIA theory (\ref{{manif}), we see the same overall structure except for the switching of the roles of $\mT^2$ and $\mT^4$ within the scaled hierarchy of large dimensions.    Note, that the IIA string theory compactified on a circle of radius $R$, is dual to Type IIB string theory compactified on a circle of radius $1/R$ (at the same value of the coupling constant). In some sense, we may actually \it see \rm the effects of $T$-duality by comparing \eq{{manif} and \eq{{miib}.  If we identify one of the $\mS^1$'s in the $\mT^2$ as the $\mS^1$ that is transformed by $T$-duality, it makes sense that the $\mT^2$ of one theory will be of smaller area than the $\mT^2$ of the other theory. Of course $T$-duality alone does not explain why the area of the $\mT^2$ in the IIB theory should be smaller then that of the $\mT^2$ in the IIA theory.  This difference is determined by the brane spectrums of the IIA and IIB gases and the dynamics arising from their respective cosmologies.  The $T$-duality relation between the Type IIA and Type IIB theories  provides an interesting context in which to explore mirror symmetry~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rr,Strominger:1996it}.  Consider the IIA string on a Calabi-Yau manifold $\M$ (section~\ref{{iiacy}).  The manifold of states of a $D0$-brane make up $\M$ itself, since the $D0$-brane can live anywhere. Now consider the dual IIB theory on the mirror manifold $\W$.  The $Dp$-branes of the IIB theory can wrap around the non-trivial cycles of $\W$.  As we have explained, these will be odd $p$, $p$-branes and the Betti numbers of $\W$ have $b_1 = b_5 =0$,  which implies we must have $p=3$ winding branes.  As explained in~\cite{{Polchinski:1998rr,Strominger:1996it} this suggests a $T$-duality on three axes.  The $D0$-brane will have three coordinates that map to internal Wilson lines on the $D3$-brane, which must therefore be topologically a $\mT^3$.  Hence $\W$ is a $\mT^3$ fibration and the mirror transformation is $T$-duality on the three axes of $\mT^3$.  This implies that $\M$ must also be a  $\mT^3$ fibration.   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \section{{Conclusions} %---------------------------------------------------- %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \label{{conc}   %------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The Brane Gas model of the early universe provides a potential solution to the dimensionality problem, which is a problem of both string theory and cosmology.   Previous formulations of the model have failed to incorporate superstring  compactifications capable of leading to realistic models of particle physics.   We have taken the first steps toward modifying the scenario to accommodate compactifications  on spaces with non-trivial holonomy.  Brane gases constructed from various branches of the $M$-theory moduli space were analyzed.  By considering the dynamics of these gases  in backgrounds of different topologies, we come to the conclusion that the general  properties and successes of the cosmological model introduced in~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}  remain intact.  In particular, we discussed compactification on manifolds with non-trivial $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ holonomy, which correspond to $K3$ and Calabi-Yau three-folds, respectively.  Despite the lack of one-cycles around each dimension in these spaces, specific cases exist in which only a three-dimensional subspace can become large (e.g., section~\ref{{iiabg}).  Superstring duality symmetries become more lucid  within this cosmological context.  Several examples are given where brane gas models constructed from one sector of the $M$-theory moduli space are linked to dual models in another.  We believe these considerations provide further evidence for the conjectured duality symmetries of string theory.   Finally, we constructed a model of cosmological brane gases from $E_8 \times E_8$  heterotic string theory on $K3 \times \mT^2$.  This gives an $\N=2$ theory in four-dimensions, on a manifold with nontrivial homology.  Such an example is a significant improvement, from the point of view of particle phenomenology, to the BGC of~\cite{{Alexander:2000xv}.  Using the power of duality we relate this theory to a brane gas model constructed from Type IIA string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau three-fold with nontrivial $SU(3)$ holonomy.  We argue that this example provides an existence proof of the compatibility between Brane Gas Cosmology and Calabi-Yau  compactifications.  %-----------------------------------------------------------------------------  %\clearpage   %------------------------------------------------------------------------------   %----------------------------------------------------------------------- \section*{{Acknowledgments}   %-----------------------------------------------------------------------  I would like to thank R.~Brandenberger for his comments on a draft of this article and for numerous useful discussions.

It is a {{\it tensionless} string theory  because the action reduces to  perimeter for the flat Wilson loop. We are able to solve and quantize this high-derivative nonlinear two-dimensional conformal field theory. The absence of conformal anomaly in quantum theory requires that the space-time should be 13-dimensional. We have found that all particles, with arbitrary large spin, are massless. This pure massless spectrum is consistent with the tensionless character of the theory and we speculate that it may describe unbroken phase of standard string theory when $ \alpha^{{'} \rightarrow \infty$.   %\end{{abstract} %\thispagestyle{{empty} %\end{{titlepage}  \newpage  \pagestyle{{plain} %\pagenumbering{{roman}  A string model which is exclusively based on the concept of extrinsic curvature was suggested in  \cite{{geo}. It describes random surfaces embedded in D-dimensional spacetime  with the following action \be\label{{funaction} S =m \cdot L= {{m\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h}\sqrt{{K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}}, \ee where $m$ has dimension of mass, $h_{{ab}$ is the induced metric and $K^{{i}_{{ab}$ is the second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature). In the above theory extrinsic curvature term $alone$ should be considered as fundamental action of the theory. The dependence on the extrinsic curvature in  (\ref{{funaction}) guarantees proportionality of the action to the length $ L $. The last property makes the theory very close to the Feynman path integral for a point-like relativistic particle because when the surface degenerates into a single world line the action  (\ref{{funaction}) becomes  proportional to the length of the world line \be\label{{limit} S ~~ \rightarrow ~~ m \int ds \ee and the functional integral over surfaces naturally transforms into the Feynman path integral for a point-like relativistic particle\footnote{{This theory is essentially different in its geometrical meaning with the actions considered in \cite{{polykov} and there is no $area$ term in the action as it was in previous studies \cite{{polykov}.}.  To illustrate these concepts let us consider a surface in a form of cylinder of radius $R$ and of length $T$. We can easily compute the action: the term $K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}$ is equal to $1/R^2$ and the action is equal to $2T + 2\pi R$ (the last term is a contribution coming from the boundary of the cylinder). When the radius of the cylinder $R$ tends to zero, the cylinder shrinks to a world line of length $T$, and the action becomes proportional to the length of the degenerated surface.  This string theory is {{\it tensionless} because for the flat Wilson loop the action is equal to its perimeter $S=m(R+T)$, and at the {{\it classical level string tension is equal to zero}. In the recent articles \cite{{geo,manvelyan} the authors studied quantum fluctuations at one-loop level and demonstrated that quantum fluctuations generate an area term, that is a string tension. Our aim now is to further study the symmetry properties of this model, specifically its conformal properties in order to treat this nonlinear system exactly.  I shall consider two different theories: the original model A when the metric tensor on the world sheet is induced by embedding into the target space-time and the second model B when the world sheet metric is considered as an independent field. We develop technical tools allowing to solve the model B and to quantize this high-derivative nonlinear two-dimensional conformal field theory. The contribution to the central charge from bosonic coordinates is twice bigger than in the standard bosonic string theory. The contribution of Faddeev-Popov ghost and an anti-ghost fields to the central charge remains the same, therefore the absence of conformal anomaly requires that  the space-time should be 13-dimensional. The mode expansion of the fundamental fields allows to demonstrate that {{\it all particles, with arbitrary large spin, are massless}. This pure massless spectrum is consistent with the tensionless character of the model B and we speculate that it may describe unbroken phase of standard string theory \cite{{gross} when $ \alpha^{{'} \rightarrow \infty$ and $M^{{2}_{{n} = {{1\over \alpha^{{'}}(n-1) \rightarrow 0$. Large amount of {{\it zero norm states} is an indication of enhanced symmetry in our system. David Gross defined this limit as an unbroken phase of string theory where one should observe enhanced symmetry \cite{{gross}. We hope that this approach will also provide better understanding of the original  theory A which probably describe the broken string phase.  As in \cite{{manvelyan} we shall represent the gonihedric action (\ref{{funaction}) in a form \begin{{equation}\label{{conaction} S= {{m\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h}\sqrt{{ \left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}}, \end{{equation} here ~$h_{{ab}=\partial_{{a}X_{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}$ ~is the induced metric,~$\Delta(h)= 1/\sqrt{{h}~\partial_{{a}\sqrt{{h}h^{{ab} \partial_{{b} $ ~is  Laplace operator and $K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}=\left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}$. The second fundamental form $K$ is defined through the relations: $ K^{{i}_{{ab}n_{{\mu}^{{i}=\partial_{{a}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}- \Gamma^{{c}_{{ab}\partial_{{c}X_{{\mu}=\nabla_{{a}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}, $ $ n_{{\mu}^{{i}n_{{\mu}^{{j}=\delta_{{ij},\quad n_{{\mu}^{{i} \partial_{{a}X_{{\mu}=0,$ where $n_{{\mu}^{{i}$ are $D-2$ normals and $a,b=1,2;~ \mu=0,1,2,...,D-1;\eta^{{\mu\nu} =(-+..+);~  i,j=1,..,D-2.$  Below I shall consider the model B which has the same action (\ref{{conaction}) but now it should be interpreted as a functional of two independent field variables $X^{{\mu}$ and $h_{{ab}$, that is, we shall consider it as two-dimensional quantum gravity interacting with scalar fields $X^{{\mu}$. At this stage the model B is not connected any more with any embedding into space-time. The aim is to compute the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field $X^{{\mu}$ and to demonstrate that it is traceless. Thus this theory is conformally invariant at the classical level \footnote{{It is not obvious at all  that the last model is equivalent to the original one even at the classical level, and as we shall see it is  not, but this study will help to spot some common properties and useful formulas.}.  To get classical equations and to construct world sheet energy-momentum tensor one should compute variation of the action with respect to the metric $h^{{ab}$ which is defined as \be \delta S = - {{1\over 2\pi} \int \sqrt{{h} T_{{ab} \delta h^{{ab} d^{{2}\zeta. \ee The variation of the action is \beqa \delta S = {{m\over\pi} \delta \int \sqrt{{h}~ \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}~ d^{{2}\zeta  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nonumber\\ ={{m\over\pi} \int(-{{1\over 2}) \sqrt{{h}~h_{{ab}~ \delta h^{{ab} \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}~ d^{{2}\zeta + {{m\over\pi} \int \sqrt{{h}~{{\triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}} ~\delta \triangle (h) X^{{\mu} ~ d^{{2}\zeta \label{{variation} \eeqa and we can proceed computing the variation of the Laplace operator \be\label{{varlap} \delta ~\triangle (h) X^{{\mu} = {{1\over 2} {{1\over \sqrt{{h}} h_{{ab} \delta h^{{ab} \partial_c \sqrt{{h} h^{{cd} \partial_d X^{{\mu} + {{1\over \sqrt{{h}} \partial_a ( \sqrt{{h} \delta h^{{ab} - {{1\over 2} h^{{ab}\sqrt{{h} h_{{cd}~ \delta h^{{cd}  ) \partial_b X^{{\mu}. \ee The first term on r.h.s. of (\ref{{variation}) will be cancelled by the first term coming from  (\ref{{varlap}), therefore \beqa\label{{variation1} \delta S =  {{m\over\pi} \int {{ \triangle (h) X^{{\mu}    \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}} }~ \partial_a \{{( \sqrt{{h} \delta h^{{ab} - {{1\over 2} h^{{ab}\sqrt{{h} h_{{cd}~ \delta h^{{cd}  ) ~\partial_b X^{{\mu} \} ~ d^{{2}\zeta . \eeqa Integrating by part we can extract the $T_{{ab}$ in covariant form \be\label{{cons1} T_{{ab} =  \nabla_{{\{{a } \left( m{{ \triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}} \right) ~\nabla_{{b\}} X^{{\mu} -  h_{{ab}~h^{{cd} ~\nabla_{{c}~ \left(m {{ \triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}} \right)~\nabla_{{d} X^{{\mu} \ee where $\{{a ~~~b\} $ denotes a symmetric sum.  It is easy to see that the energy-momentum tensor is traceless: \be\label{{conformal} h^{{ab} T_{{ab} =0, \ee thus we have interaction with conformally invariant matter field $X^{{\mu}$. The equation of motion, in a given case the constraint equation, is \be\label{{cons2} T_{{ab} = -~{{2 \pi \over   \sqrt{{h}~}{{\delta S \over \delta h^{{ab}}~ =~ 0. \ee We can get the equations which follow from the variation of the action over coordinates $X^{{\mu}$ as well: \be\label{{massshell} {{\pi \over   \sqrt{{h}~}{{\delta S \over \delta X^{{\mu}} = \triangle (h)~\left(m {{\triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}} \right) =0. \ee We can make all these formulas more transparent introducing the operator $\Pi^{{\mu}$ $$ \Pi^{{\mu} =m {{\triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}}, $$ it has a property very similar with the constraint equation for a point-like relativistic particle: \be\label{{secondcon} (III)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\Theta ~\equiv ~\Pi^{{\mu}\Pi^{{\mu}~ -~ m^{{2}~=0,~ \ee and allows to rewrite the action (\ref{{conaction}) in the form \be\label{{equivaction} S= {{1\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta ~\sqrt{{h}~\Pi^{{\mu}~ \Delta(h) X_{{\mu}. \ee The equations now look like \be\label{{motioneq} (I)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\triangle (h)~\Pi^{{\mu} =0 \ee and \be\label{{tensor} (II)~~~~~~T_{{ab} = \nabla_{{\{{a }\Pi^{{\mu}  ~\nabla_{{b\}} X^{{\mu} ~-~~h_{{ab}~h^{{cd} ~ \nabla_{{c}~ \Pi^{{\mu}~\nabla_{{d} X^{{\mu}~=~0. \ee One can check the covariant conservation of the energy momentum tensor $ \nabla^{{a}~T_{{ab} =0. $ Equations (\ref{{motioneq}), (\ref{{tensor})  and (\ref{{secondcon}) completely define the system. We have equation of motion (\ref{{motioneq}) together with the constraint equations (\ref{{tensor}) and (\ref{{secondcon}). We should stress that in addition to the "standard" constraint equation (\ref{{tensor}) we have a new type of constraint (\ref{{secondcon}).   We can fix the conformal gauge $h_{{ab}=\rho\eta_{{ab}$ using reparametrization invariance of the action to derive it in the form (see (\ref{{conaction}),(\ref{{equivaction})) \be\label{{gaga} \acute{{S} = {{m\over\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2} X \right)^{{2}} ~=~{{1\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta ~\Pi^{{\mu}~\partial^{{2} X^{{\mu}. \ee In this gauge the equations of motion are more simple \be\label{{confequa} (I)~~~~~~~~~~~~\partial^{{2}\left(m \frac{{\partial^{{2}X_{{\mu}} {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X \right)^2}}\right) =0. \ee and they should be accompanied by the constraint equations (\ref{{secondcon}) and (\ref{{tensor}) \beqa\label{{cons3} (II)~~~T_{{ab} &=&  ~\partial_{{\{{a } \left( m{{ \partial^{{2} X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\partial^{{2} X )^{{2}}} \right) ~\partial_{{b\}} X^{{\mu} -~ ~\eta_{{ab}~\partial_{{c}~ \left( m{{ \partial^{{2} X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\partial^{{2} X )^{{2}}} \right)~\partial^{{c} X^{{\mu} =0,\nonumber\\ (III)~~~\Pi^{{\mu}\Pi^{{\mu}&-& m^{{2}~=0,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\Pi^{{\mu} = m \frac{{\partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}} {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X \right)^2}}. \eeqa In the light cone coordinates $\zeta^{{\pm}=\zeta^{{0}\pm\zeta^{{1}$ the conformal gauge looks like: $ h_{{++}=h_{{--}=0, \qquad h_{{+-}={{1\over 2}\rho, $ and the constrains (\ref{{cons3}) take the form \beqa\label{{cons9} T_{{++}= {{1\over 2} ~(T_{{00} + T_{{01})= {{1\over 2}(\partial_{{0}\Pi^{{\mu} +\partial_{{1}\Pi^{{\mu}) (\partial_{{0}X^{{\mu} +\partial_{{1}X^{{\mu})= 2~\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu},\nonumber\\ T_{{--}= {{1\over 2} ~(T_{{00} - T_{{01})= {{1\over 2} (\partial_{{0}\Pi^{{\mu} - \partial_{{1}\Pi^{{\mu}) (\partial_{{0}X^{{\mu} - \partial_{{1}X^{{\mu})= 2~\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}, \eeqa the trace is equal to the $T_{{+-}$ component $ 2 T_{{+-}= T_{{00} - T_{{11}=0. $ The conservation of the energy momentum tensor takes the form $ \partial_{{-}T_{{++} = \partial_{{+}T_{{--}=0 $ and  requires that its components are analytic $T_{{++}=T_{{++}(\zeta^{{+})$ and anti-analytic $~T_{{--}=T_{{--}(\zeta^{{-})$ functions. Thus our system has infinite number of conserved charges. This residual symmetry can be easily   seen in gauge fixed action (\ref{{gaga}) written in light cone coordinates $$ \acute{{S} = {{4m\over\pi} \int \sqrt{{(\partial_{{+}\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu})^{{2}}~ d\zeta^{{+}d\zeta^{{-}, $$ it is invariant under the transformations $ \zeta^{{+} = f({{\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}}),~~~\zeta^{{-} = g({{\tilde{{\zeta}^{{-}}) $ where $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary functions.  The classical equation  is $ \partial^{{2}~\Pi^{{\mu}=0 $, therefore $\Pi^{{\mu}$ is a function of the form \be \Pi^{{\mu} =m~{{\partial^{{2} X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\partial^{{2} X)^{{2}}} = {{1\over 2}(\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})).\label{{seconconsol} \ee Taking the ratio $ {{\Pi^{{\mu} \over \Pi^{{0} } = {{\partial^{{2} X^{{\mu} \over \partial^{{2} X^{{0}} $ one can find the second derivative $\partial^{{2} X^{{\mu}$ written in the form $$ \partial^{{2} X^{{\mu} = {{\Pi^{{\mu} \over \Pi^{{0} } \partial^{{2} X^{{0}= \Pi^{{\mu} ~4\Omega(\zeta^+ ,\zeta^-) = {{1\over 2}~ [\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})]~4\Omega(\zeta^+ ,\zeta^-), $$ where $\Omega(\zeta^+ ,\zeta^-)$ is another arbitrary function of $\zeta^+$ and $\zeta^-$. Thus the equation reduces to the following one: $ \partial_{{+}~\partial_{{-} ~X^{{\mu} = {{1\over 2}[\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})]~\Omega(\zeta^+ ,\zeta^-), $ and $X^{{\mu}$ is a sum of inhomogeneous and homogeneous solutions \be\label{{I} X^{{\mu}= \Psi^{{\mu}(\zeta^+ ,\zeta^-) + {{1\over 2}[X^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^+) + X^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^-)], \ee where inhomogeneous solution is \be\label{{II} \Psi^{{\mu}(\zeta^+ ,\zeta^-)= {{1\over 2}\int^{{\zeta^+}_{{0} \int^{{\zeta^-}_{{0}[\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{-})]~\Omega(\tilde{{\zeta}^+ ,\tilde{{\zeta}^-) d\tilde{{\zeta}^+d\tilde{{\zeta}^- \ee and $X^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^+)$, $X^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^-)$ are arbitrary functions of $\zeta^+$ and $\zeta^-$. The constraints (\ref{{cons9}) take the form \beqa T_{{++}=2~\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu} = {{1\over 2}~ \dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) ~\{{\int^{{\zeta^-}_{{0} [\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{-})]~\Omega(\zeta^+ ,\tilde{{\zeta}^-) d\tilde{{\zeta}^- +\dot{{X}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^+)\},\nonumber\\ T_{{--}= 2~\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}= {{1\over 2}~ \dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-}) ~\{{\int^{{\zeta^+}_{{0} [\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})]~\Omega(\tilde{{\zeta}^+ ,\zeta^-) d\tilde{{\zeta}^+ + \dot{{X}^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^-)\}. \nonumber \eeqa Taking derivatives of the constraint equation $\Theta =0 ~$(\ref{{secondcon}), and using our solution (\ref{{seconconsol}) one can see that \be\label{{secformcons} \Theta^{{(1,0)} \equiv \dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+})[\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})]=0,~~~~~~\Theta^{{(0,1)} \equiv \dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-}) ~[\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})] =0, \ee thus \be T_{{++}={{1 \over 2}~\dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+})~\dot{{X}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^+),~~~~~ T_{{--}={{1 \over 2}~\dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})~\dot{{X}^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^-)], \ee verifying the  fact they are indeed functions of only one light cone variable. We shall derive new constraints differentiating (\ref{{secformcons}), in particular \be\label{{morediriv} \Theta^{{(1,1)} \equiv \dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) \dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-}) = 0. \ee This formula has clear interpretation: left and right movers are not independent and should be normal to each other.  The action (\ref{{gaga}) is invariant under the global symmetries $\delta X^{{\mu} =\Lambda^{{\mu\nu}X_{{\nu} + a^{{\mu}$, where $\Lambda^{{\mu\nu}$ is a constant antisymmetric matrix, while $a^{{\mu}$ is a constant. The translation invariance of the action (\ref{{gaga}) $\delta_{{a} X^{{\mu} = a^{{\mu}$ results into the conserved momentum current \be P^{{\mu}_{{a} = \partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu} = \partial_{{a}\left(m \frac{{\partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}} {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X \right)^2}}\right),~~~~~~~\partial^{{a} P^{{\mu}_{{a} =0,~~~~P^{{\mu} = \int P^{{\mu}_0 d\zeta^1 \ee and Lorentz transformation $\delta_{{\Lambda} X^{{\mu} = \Lambda^{{\mu\nu}X_{{\nu}$ into angular momentum current \be M^{{\mu\nu}_{{a} = X^{{\mu}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\nu} - X^{{\nu}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu} + \Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{a}X^{{\nu} - \Pi^{{\nu}\partial_{{a}X^{{\mu},~~~~~~~\partial^{{a} M^{{\mu\nu}_{{a} =0,~~~~M^{{\mu\nu} = \int M^{{\mu\nu}_0 d\zeta^1 . \ee From its definition the momentum density, $ P^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1}) \equiv P^{{\mu}_{{0}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1}) = \partial_{{0}\Pi^{{\mu} $ is conjugate to $X^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1})$ therefore $ [X^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1}),P^{{\nu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{'1})] =  i\eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta(\zeta^{{1} - \zeta^{{'1}) $ and one can deduce that the following commutation relations should hold: \beqa\label{{basiccommutaors} [\partial_{{+} X^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta), \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\nu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{'})]= 2\pi i~ \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta^{{~'} (\zeta  - \zeta^{{'}),\nonumber\\ ~[\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta), \partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\nu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{'})]= 2\pi i~ \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta^{{~'} (\zeta  - \zeta^{{'}), \eeqa with all others equal to zero: ~$[\partial_{{\pm} X^{{\mu}_{{L,R}(\zeta), \partial_{{\pm}X^{{\nu}_{{L,R}(\zeta^{{'})]=0$,~~$[\partial_{{\pm} \Pi^{{\mu}_{{L,R}(\zeta), \partial_{{\pm}\Pi^{{\nu}_{{L,R}(\zeta^{{'})]=0$ \footnote{{Requiring that commutation relations for the energy-momentum tensor $T_{{++}$ and $T_{{--}$ should form the algebra of the two-dimensional conformal group one can get the same form of basic commutators (\ref{{basiccommutaors}).}. To make these formulas more transparent to the reader let me use the analogy with the ghosts $c^{{\pm}$ and anti-ghost $b_{{\pm\pm}$ fields (or super-ghorts), indeed the standard Faddeev-Popov action has the form $\int c~\partial_{{\pm} b$ with nonzero anti-commutator only between $c$ and $b$ fields. Making use of these commutators one can get extended algebra of constraints \beqa\label{{standardalg} [~~T_{{++}(\zeta)~, ~~~T_{{++}(\zeta^{{'})~]&=& i \pi(T_{{++}(\zeta) + T_{{++}(\zeta^{{'}))~\delta^{{~'} (\zeta - \zeta^{{'}),~~~~~~~ \nonumber\\ ~[~~T_{{++}(\zeta)~, ~\Theta(\zeta^{{'},\zeta^{{-})~]&=& -i\pi ~\Theta^{{(1,0)}(\zeta,\zeta^{{-})~\delta (\zeta - \zeta^{{'}),~~~~~~~ \nonumber\\ ~[T_{{++}(\zeta),\Theta^{{(1,0)}(\zeta^{{'},\zeta^{{-})]&=&~ i\pi~ \Theta^{{(1,0)}(\zeta,\zeta^{{-})~ \delta^{{~'} (\zeta - \zeta^{{'}),\nonumber\\ ~[T_{{++}(\zeta),\Theta^{{(0,1)}(\zeta^{{'},\zeta^{{-})]&=&~-{{i\pi\over 2} \Theta^{{(1,1)}(\zeta,\zeta^{{-})~ \delta(\zeta - \zeta^{{'}), \eeqa and so on. Similar relations holds for $T_{{--}$. The high derivative operators have been defined as (see (\ref{{secondcon}),(\ref{{secformcons}),(\ref{{morediriv}))~ $\Theta = \Pi^2 -m^2,~\Theta^{{(1,0)} =P^{{\mu}_{{L} \Pi^{{\mu},~\Theta^{{(0,1)} = \Pi^{{\mu} P^{{\mu}_{{R},~ ~\Theta^{{(1,1)} =P^{{\mu}_{{L}P^{{\mu}_{{R}$, and so on ($2P^{{\mu}_{{0} = \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L} + \partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R} = P^{{\mu}_{{L} + P^{{\mu}_{{R}$). They form an infinite abelian algebra \be\label{{nonstandard} ~[\Theta^{{(n,m)}, \Theta^{{(k,l)}]=0~~~~ \ee and hint at the existence of symmetries (\ref{{standardalg}), (\ref{{nonstandard}) higher than the conformal algebra.  From (\ref{{gaga}) we can deduce the propagator $ <\Pi^{{\mu}(\zeta)X^{{\nu}(\tilde{{\zeta})>$ $={{\eta^{{\mu\nu}\over 2} ln (\vert \zeta - \tilde{{\zeta} \vert \mu). $ Using explicit form of the solution (\ref{{I}) and (\ref{{II}) we should have \beqa <[\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+})+ \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})] ~[X^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) + X^{{\nu}_{{R}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{-}) +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nonumber\\ +\int^{{\tilde{{\zeta}^+}_{{0} \int^{{\tilde{{\zeta}^-}_{{0}[\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\tilde{{\zeta}}^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\tilde{{\tilde{{\zeta}}^{{-})]~\Omega(\tilde{{\tilde{{\zeta}}^+ , \tilde{{\tilde{{\zeta}}^-) d\tilde{{\tilde{{\zeta}}^+d\tilde{{\tilde{{\zeta}}^-]>\nonumber\\ =~\eta^{{\mu\nu}~[ln [( \zeta^{{-} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{-})\mu)] ~ +~ln [( \zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})\mu)]]. \nonumber \eeqa Because there are no correlations between right - left moving modes of $\Pi$ field and the right - left moving modes of $X$ field we shall get $ <\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^-)X^{{\nu}_{{R}(\tilde{{\zeta^-})> = ~\eta^{{\mu\nu}~ln [( \zeta^{{-} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{-})\mu)],\\ <\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^+)X^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta^+})> = ~ \eta^{{\mu\nu}~ln [( \zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})\mu)].~ $ Now we are in a position to compute the two point correlation function of the energy momentum operator: \beqa <T~T_{{++}(\zeta^{{+}) ~T_{{++}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})  >~ =~ {{1\over 4} <T:\dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) \dot{{X}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}): :\dot{{\Pi}^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) \dot{{X}^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}):>~ \nonumber\\ =~{{1\over 4}   <\dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) \dot{{X}^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) > <\dot{{X}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) ~\dot{{\Pi}^{{\nu}_{{L} (\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) > ={{1\over 4} ~{{D \over (\zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})^4}. \eeqa The ghost contribution to the central charge remains the same as for the standard bosonic string: $ -{{13\over 4} ~{{1 \over (\zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})^4}, $ therefore the absence of conformal anomaly requires that the space-time should be 13-dimensional \be D_c = 13. \ee This result can be qualitatively understood if one takes into account the fact that the field equations here are of the forth order and therefore we have two time more degrees of freedom than in the standard bosonic string theory.  Let us now find mode expansion of different operators in the general solution (\ref{{I}),(\ref{{II}). The appropriate boundary condition for closed strings is simply periodicity of the coordinates $X^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1})= X^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1} + 2\pi)$. The arbitrary periodic functions $X^{{\mu}_{{L}$ and $X^{{\mu}_{{R}$  can be written as normal mode expansions \beqa X^{{\mu}_{{L} = x^{{\mu} + {{1\over m}\pi^{{\mu}\zeta^{{+} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{{{2\over n m^2}}~ \{{q^{{\mu}_{{1n}\sin(n\zeta^{{+}) + q^{{\mu}_{{2n}\cos(n\zeta^{{+})\},\nonumber\\ X^{{\mu}_{{R} =   x^{{\mu} +  {{1\over m}\pi^{{\mu}\zeta^{{-} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{{{2\over  n m^2}}~ \{{\tilde{{q}^{{~\mu}_{{1n}\sin(n\zeta^{{-}) + \tilde{{q}^{{~\mu}_{{2n}\cos(n\zeta^{{-})\}\nonumber \eeqa and in similar manner $\Pi^{{\mu}$ \beqa \Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}=   m e^{{\mu} +  k^{{\mu}\zeta^{{+} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{{{2m^2\over n}} \{{ -p^{{\mu}_{{1n}\cos(n\zeta^{{+}) + p^{{\mu}_{{2n}\sin(n\zeta^{{+})\},\nonumber\\ \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}=   m e^{{\mu} + k^{{\mu}\zeta^{{-} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{{{2m^2\over n}} \{{-\tilde{{p}^{{\mu}_{{1n}\cos(n\zeta^{{-}) + \tilde{{p}^{{\mu}_{{2n}\sin(n\zeta^{{-})\}, \nonumber \eeqa therefore  for $\partial_{{\pm}\Pi^{{\mu}$ we shall get \beqa P^{{\mu}_{{L}=\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} = k^{{\mu} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{2nm^2} \{{p^{{\mu}_{{1n}\sin(n\zeta^{{+}) + p^{{\mu}_{{2n}\cos(n\zeta^{{+})\}\nonumber\\ P^{{\mu}_{{R}=\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu} = k^{{\mu} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{2nm^2} \{{\tilde{{p}^{{\mu}_{{1n}\sin(n\zeta^{{-}) + \tilde{{p}^{{\mu}_{{2n}\cos(n\zeta^{{-})\}. \eeqa We shall consider the coordinates $q_{{1n},q_{{2m}$ as internal degrees of freedom. Substituting the mode expansion into the commutator $ [X^{{\mu}_{{L,R}(\zeta^{{\pm}), P^{{\nu}_{{L,R}(\zeta^{{'\pm})]= 2 \pi i\eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta (\zeta^{{\pm} - \zeta^{{'\pm}) $ gives $$ [e^{{\mu}, \pi^{{\nu}]=[x^{{\mu}, k^{{\nu}] =  i\eta^{{\mu\nu},~~~[q^{{\mu}_{{i n}, p^{{\nu}_{{j m}] =  i\eta^{{\mu\nu}\delta_{{ij}  \delta_{{n m}, $$ where $i,j = 1,2$. We can now deduce a less trivial commutator $ [\partial_{{\pm}X^{{\mu}_{{R,L}(\zeta^{{\pm}), \Pi^{{\nu}_{{R,L}(\zeta^{{'\pm})]=  -2 \pi i\eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta (\zeta^{{\pm} - \zeta^{{'\pm}) $ with all other commutators equal to zero. If one introduces operators \beqa b^{{\mu}_{{n} ={{q^{{\mu}_{{1n} - i q^{{\mu}_{{2n}\over \sqrt{{2}},~~~ b^{{+\mu}_{{n} ={{q^{{\mu}_{{1n} + i q^{{\mu}_{{2n}\over \sqrt{{2}}~~~~ a^{{\mu}_{{n} ={{p^{{\mu}_{{2n} + i p^{{\mu}_{{1n}\over \sqrt{{2}},~~~ a^{{+\mu}_{{n} ={{p^{{\mu}_{{2n} - i p^{{\mu}_{{1n}\over \sqrt{{2}},\nonumber \eeqa then one can see that the only nonzero commutator is \be [a^{{\mu}_{{n},b^{{+\mu}_{{m}]= \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta_{{nm} \ee and our basic fields will have expansion \beqa P^{{\mu}_{{L}=k^{{\mu} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} \sqrt{{nm^2} (a^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{+}} + a^{{+\mu}_{{n} e^{{ i n\zeta^{{+}}),  \nonumber\\ \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L}= {{1\over m}\pi^{{\mu}  + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} \sqrt{{n\over  m^2} (b^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{+}} + b^{{+\mu}_{{n} e^{{ i n\zeta^{{+}}). \eeqa Let us now define the Fourier expansion of our constraint operators, they are the standard Virasoro operator $L$ and our new operators $\Theta$ \be L_{{n}  = <e^{{in\zeta^+} :P^{{\mu}_{{L}~\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L}: >,~~~~ \Theta_{{n,l}  =  <e^{{in\zeta^+ + il\zeta^-}<:  \Pi^{{\mu}~\Pi^{{\mu} -m^2  :> \ee together with the rest high derivative operators \beqa \Theta^{{(1,0)}_{{n,l} &=& <~e^{{in\zeta^+ + il\zeta^-} :P^{{\mu}_{{L}~\Pi^{{\mu}:>,~~~~~~~~~ \Theta^{{(0,1)}_{{n,l} = <e^{{in\zeta^+ + il\zeta^-}:\Pi^{{\mu}~P^{{\mu}_{{R}:>,\nonumber\\ \Theta^{{(1,1)}_{{n,l} &=& <e^{{in\zeta^+ + il\zeta^-} :P^{{\mu}_{{L}~ P^{{\mu}_{{R}:>~~~~.... \eeqa and so on. In order to have explicit form of these operators it is useful to introduce following oscillators \beqa \alpha^{{\mu}_{{n}&=& m \sqrt{{n}~a^{{\mu}_{{n}, ~~~ n > 0,~~~~~\alpha^{{\mu}_{{0}=k^{{\mu};~~~ \beta^{{\mu}_{{n}= {{1\over m} \sqrt{{n}~b^{{\mu}_{{n},~~~ n > 0,~~~~~\beta^{{\mu}_{{0}=\pi^{{\mu}/m  \nonumber\\ \alpha^{{\mu}_{{-n}&=& m \sqrt{{n}~a^{{+\mu}_{{n}, ~~~ n > 0,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \beta^{{\mu}_{{-n}= {{1\over m} \sqrt{{n}~b^{{+\mu}_{{n},~~~ n > 0, \eeqa with nonzero commutator \be [\alpha^{{\mu}_{{n}, \beta^{{\nu}_{{k}]= n~\eta^{{\mu\nu}\delta_{{n+k,0}. \ee The fields are now represented in the form $ P^{{\mu}_{{L}= \sum \alpha^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{+}},~ \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L}= \sum \beta^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{+}} $ and allow to represent the constraint operators in the form \beqa L_{{n} &=&\sum_{{l}:\alpha_{{n-l} \cdot\beta_{{l}:\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{0,0} &=& m^2( e^{{2} -1) + \sum_{{n \neq 0} {{1\over 4 n^2}:(\alpha_{{-n}~\alpha_{{n} + \tilde{{\alpha}_{{-n}~\tilde{{\alpha}_{{n}):\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{n,0} &=& {{im\over n}~e \cdot \alpha_{{n} -{{1\over 4}\sum_{{l \neq 0,n} {{1\over (n-l)l}:\alpha_{{n-l}\cdot\alpha_{{l}:\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{0,n} &=&{{im\over n}~e \cdot \tilde{{\alpha}_{{n} -{{1\over 4}\sum_{{l \neq 0,n} {{1\over (n-l)l}:\tilde{{\alpha}_{{n-l}\cdot\tilde{{\alpha}_{{l}:\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{n,l} &=& -{{1\over 2 nl}:\alpha_{{n}\cdot\tilde{{\alpha}_{{l}: ~~... \eeqa and so on. Direct computation with the use of basic commutators allows to find extended algebra of constrains (\ref{{standardalg}) for Fourier components \beqa [L_n , L_m] &=& (l-n) L_{{n+m} + {{D\over 6}(n^3 -n)\delta_{{n+m,0}\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , \Theta_{{m,k}] &=& (m+n) \Theta_{{n+m,k}~~~~(J=0),... \eeqa and so on. Here J denotes the conformal spin of the corresponding operators.  The important fact which uniquely define the spectrum of this string theory is the time dependence of the operator $\Pi^2$ $$ (\Pi^2 -m^2) = k^2 ~\zeta_{{0}^2 + 2\{{m e \cdot k ~ + ~ k\cdot\Pi_{{oscil} \} \zeta_{{0} + \Pi^{{2}_{{oscil} + 2m e \cdot \Pi_{{oscil} + m^2( e^2 -1). $$ The first operator diverges quadratically with $\zeta_0$ and the second one linearly. Therefore in order to have normalizable states in physical Hilbert space one should impose corresponding constraints. We are enforced to define the physical Hilbert space as \be k^2 ~ \Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~e \cdot k ~\Psi_{{phys} =0, ~~~k \cdot \alpha_{{n}  ~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~k \cdot \tilde{{\alpha}_{{n} ~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~~~n>0. \ee The first equation states that {{\it all physical states with different spins are massless}. This is consistent with tensionless character of the theory. We should also  impose the rest of the constraints \beqa\label{{last} L_0 \Psi_{{phys} = \{{k \cdot \pi  +m \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} n(a^{{+}_n b_n + b^{{+}_n a_n)\}\Psi_{{phys} &=&0\nonumber\\ L_n \Psi_{{phys}&=&0,~~~~~n > 0\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{0,0}\Psi_{{phys} = \{{( e^{{2} -1) + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} {{1\over 2n}(a^{{+}_{{n}~a_{{n} + \tilde{{a}^{{+}_{{n}~\tilde{{a}_{{n}) \}\Psi_{{phys} &=&0\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{n,l}\Psi_{{phys}&=&0,~~~~~n,l > 0~ .......... \eeqa and so on. For the ground state $a_n |k,e,0> = b_n|k,e,0>=0$ we have $k^2 = 0,~ek =0,~e^2 = 1,$~ and~$ k \pi = k\partial_e |k,e,0> =0$ and therefore massless states of integer spin $j=0,1,2,..$ with momentum vector $k^{{\mu}$ and polarization tensor $e^{{\{{\mu_1} ....e^{{\mu_j \} }$. Equations (\ref{{last}) should guarantee that there is no ghost states in our physical subspace. One can see also large amount of {{\it zero norm states}, an indication of enhanced symmetry in our system. One should study in great details this Hilbert space in order to learn more about spin content of the theory and to prove the absence of the negative norm states. The details will be given elsewhere.  Despite the fact that this model is not equivalent to the original one, it may represent an important limit of standard bosonic string theory when $ \alpha^{{'} \rightarrow \infty$. Indeed in this limit all string states become massless $M^{{2}_{{n} = {{1\over \alpha^{{'}}(n-1) \rightarrow 0$. David Gross defined this limit as an unbroken phase of string theory where one should observe enhanced symmetry \cite{{gross}.  Below I shall return to the original model A which contains many elements of the above model. As we have seen we can not simply consider the action (\ref{{conaction}) as a functional of two independent field variables $X$ and $h$ without losing connection with the original system. In order to consider them as independent variables and at the same time to have equivalent theory at the classical level we have to introduce additional  Lagrange multipliers $\lambda^{{ab}$. The corresponding action is \be S={{m\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \left\{{\sqrt{{h}~\sqrt{{\left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}}+\lambda^{{ab}\left(\partial_{{a}X^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}- h_{{ab}\right)\right\}. \ee and the equations of motion are: \beqa\label{{acsel} \triangle (h)~\left({{\triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}} \right) -2~{{1\over \sqrt{{h}}\partial_{{a}\left( \lambda^{{ab}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}\right)=0,~~~ \partial_{{a}X^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}-h_{{ab}=0,\\ t_{{ab} = ~T_{{ab} + {{m\over \sqrt{{h}}~\lambda_{{ab}=0, \eeqa where  we already  know $T_{{ab}$ (\ref{{cons1}),(\ref{{tensor}). For the trace of the energy momentum tensor we have: \be h^{{ab} t_{{ab} = {{m\over \sqrt{{h}}~h^{{ab}\lambda_{{ab}, \ee where we have used the fact that $h^{{ab} T_{{ab} =0$. If we substitute the expression for $\lambda$ from the last equation into the first one we shall get unique equation for the $X^{{\mu}$: \be \triangle (h)~\left(m{{\triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X^{{\mu})^{{2}}} \right) +~{{2\over \sqrt{{h}}\partial_{{a}\left(\sqrt{{h}T^{{ab}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}\right)=0, \ee where $h_{{ab}=\partial_{{a}X^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}$. We can get the same equation by direct variation of the original action (\ref{{conaction}) $ \delta S  = \int \{{ {{\delta S \over \delta h_{{ab}} {{\delta h_{{ab} \over \delta X^{{\mu}}  \delta X^{{\mu} + {{\delta S \over \delta X^{{\mu}} \delta X^{{\mu}  \}d^{{2}\zeta $ and substituting the expressions for ${{\delta S \over \delta h_{{ab}}$ (\ref{{cons2}) and ${{\delta S \over \delta X^{{\mu}}$ (\ref{{massshell}). Again we can fix the conformal gauge $h_{{ab}=\rho\eta_{{ab}$ using reparametrization, in this gauge the equations of motion are : \be\label{{111} \partial^{{2}\frac{{\partial^{{2}X_{{\mu}} {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X^{{\nu}\right)^2}} -2~\partial_{{a}\left(\lambda^{{ab}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}\right)=0,~~~ \partial_{{a}X^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}-\rho\eta_{{ab}=0,~~~ \rho T_{{ab} +m~\lambda_{{ab} =0. \ee where $T_{{ab}$ is given in (\ref{{cons3}). Comparing these equations with the ones in the previous section (see equations (\ref{{confequa}) and (\ref{{cons3})) one can be convinced once again  that these two systems are not equivalent even at the classical level, but are  close enough.

It is not an exaggeration to say that most substantial advances in the history of physics have been accompanied by the realization of links among facts originally appearing to be independent. The application of unification ideas differs though from one case to the other in the scope, methods, and  results, and it is therefore difficult to characterize it uniquely by a single rule. Thus, the unification of known facts has sometimes led to the prediction of  new phenomena, and these  connections have been either experimental, theoretical, or both. It shall be useful instead to briefly review some highlights.  The concept  of unification  is linked to the very idea of science (or then philosophy) conceived by  the early Greek philosophers, who  in their research of nature sought   unifying principles, although those they found were premature in their applicability. However, a perdurable idea from those times representing  probably the most  powerful tool in physics is that of assuming a  mathematical structure behind physical phenomena, an idea ascribed to  Pythagoras. In modern times Galileo helped to revive the  idea of the universality of physical law in the cosmos  by presenting supporting evidence  (e.g. the shadows provoked  by the sun in the moon).  The principle of relativity is a related idea he discovered which assumes this universality for different inertial frames,  putting powerful constraints on the possible allowed laws.  Newton  showed, with his  new understanding of gravity,  that the motion of cosmic and terrestrial  bodies obeys the same laws, thus demonstrating  for  the first time a deep relation between phenomena in both expanses.   Electric and magnetic phenomena were considered separated until the XIX Century. With the work of Amp\`ere and Faraday it was found experimentally that one leads to the other  by changing the kinematic state of the charges involved.  Maxwell carried out the formalization of this into a series of equations which provided a new understanding of light as one of many possible waves with an electromagnetic origin, and traveling at the speed of light,  a quantity that was predicted from the equations.  In this century, Einstein's special relativity integrated Galileo's relativity principle with  Maxwell's equations' invariance into a new framework by dethroning time from  its privileged use  and putting it on a similar footing  to space, while the speed of light was assumed constant in all reference frames.  From here a series of new phenomena were predicted, as the equivalence  between mass and energy.  These ideas were expanded by linking gravity, matter, and space-time through general relativity (GR),  a theory which assumes a geometrical framework. However, this was done only partially since in Einstein's GR equations only the side describing gravity and space-time's geometry has this interpretation  while the other, containing the energy-momentum tensor has not necessarily this form, and waits for geometrization, if ever. GR   predicts  new phenomena as black holes, while in the Newtonian weak gravitational limit it produces small corrections.  %KALUZA-KLEIN  Einstein attempted to  unify  gravity and  electromagnetism,  but he was not really successful; nevertheless, in the meantime Kaluza and Klein developed the idea of extending  GR  to more than 3+1 dimensions,   relating an  additional dimension to a vector potential which could be shown to describe the electromagnetic field. This feat   has not led to  more information, the prediction of new phenomena, or has been a option that  has been possible to  test but it does show that it is a viable possibility. Therefore, although  it cannot be classified as a successful unification it  retains   the status of a useful working hypothesis that is actually applied in theories as supergravity or superstrings.     Quantum mechanics (QM) successfully   accounted for the prevalence  of   particle and wave  characteristics  encountered in  different experiments with the same objects, which is otherwise contradictory in a classical framework. This comprised a   completely new feature for the constituents of nature, which were previously thought to belong to separated classes presenting each kind of behavior.  The  introduction of Planck's constant required by QM   gives rise, when using   Newton's gravity constant and the speed of light,  to fundamental values of mass, time,  and position; this  constitutes a unification in the sense that all measurable quantities   can   be related to  these  fundamental constants. A theory which would join together GR and QM should certainly use these.  %DIRAC One of the most beautiful examples of unification comes from Dirac who discovered a new type of  equation that both satisfied the principles of special relativity and those  of QM. Their  marriage in this new setting provided a new understanding of the spin 1/2 degree of freedom, a variable previously postulated to account for various atomic phenomena and understood to be related  to magnetic properties of fermions, but with an otherwise inscrutable origin. Dirac's equation not only naturally gives rise to this variable but also predicts the electron's magnetic moment with a relatively close accuracy.  In recent times the latest success in the application of unification ideas has been in relating the weak and electromagnetic interactions in the Weinberg-Salam model (Glashow, 1961, Salam, 1968, Weinberg, 1967),  which  considers them to originate  in a gauge symmetry,  although their respective groups $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$  assume totally different forms. Still, the theory succeeded  in predicting parameters as the masses of the vectors carrying these interactions and the existence of neutral currents.   Many of today's puzzles in fundamental aspects  of physics are encountered in  the current theory of elementary particles and fields, the standard model (SM), which involves many mysteries. Although it  is quite successful in describing their behavior, its very construction requires input determined by phenomenology but which is otherwise ad hoc, and  which consists of a  large number of parameters. Worse, many aspects of this input still  need justification. It is not clear  why there are three generations of leptons and quarks nor the origin of their masses and  the latter's mixing angles. Neither is clear what is the source of the parameters needed to  describe the Higgs particle, which   is as yet only a  mathematical device to break the gauge symmetry and give masses to particles;  indeed, we lack a more fundamental reason for the presence of a spin 0 particle. We also lack information on  the origin of the gauge groups of the fundamental interactions   $SU(3)\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)$,   the origin of their coupling constants values, and   the reason for the isospin force acting  only on a given chirality, which leads to parity violation (Lee, Yang, 1956). %\cite{{Yang} However, in this case, very interesting  connections  have been obtained from grand unified models on both the forces and the values of coupling constants (Georgi, Glashow, 1974). %\cite{{unification}. These models  assume a common origin for these forces' gauge groups through the postulation of a group containing them as subgroups. Still, the overall picture hints at  a missing piece of information on an underlying principle. It may be worth to return  to unification ideas for a clue. In particular, we now concentrate on  the current concepts of spin and   space-time symmetries, invoked by the first,  and from here we follow  a possible connection path to  gauge symmetries.  While QM offers a common description for the  shared properties of  bosons and fermions   it still requires a specialized treatment for each to account for their differences. Thus, while the space-time description of the propagation of a fermion is similar to that of a boson this  differs in the spin wave functions, which from quantum field theory  (QFT) are known to have a determinant influence on their very different collective behavior. A unified theory describing both kind of particles  should address the question of their spin. The only physical connection  comes along through  the vertex interaction which  is determined uniquely by the gauge symmetry (e. g., in the electromagnetic case). Still, boson and fermion degrees of freedom are presently otherwise assumed  independent from each other. In looking for a closer connection among them it is worth having in mind that the spin 1/2 particle representation of the Lorentz group ($SO(3,1)$)  is  more fundamental than the  vector one as the latter can be obtained from a tensor product of the first  but not the other way around.     On another plane, the  fact  that a  particle   description requires  both configuration (or momentum) and spin spaces  leads in turn to the fact that it is only a combination of both types of corresponding generators that  allows for invariance under Lorentz transformations, which makes them  equally necessary.  In this context, it is worth recalling the Kaluza-Klein idea and wonder whether there exists a connection of the forces of nature to extended spin spaces, instead of additional spatial dimensions. In a way,  this idea underlay the attempt of Heisenberg  and Condon  to  understand the difference between  the proton and the neutron. Having in mind the similarity with spin, they assigned them with hindsight  a doublet structure,  calling it isotopic spin or iso-spin, a concept that evolved into the   $SU(2)_L$ group underlying the modern treatment of the weak interactions.  In this paper we  propose  a new field equation, based on   Dirac's,  which allows for a unified treatment of both boson and fermion spin degrees of freedom by making the solutions share the same solution space and at the same time which encompasses degrees of freedom which can be assigned to the gauge groups. The equation  and  the surrounding formalism are developed in a  quantum mechanical relativistic framework, but some aspects  of QFT will be touched. We will show the dimensionality of the solution space  restricts   both the possible solutions  and the symmetries present, and that from these  an interaction prescription emerges naturally  among the field solutions.   In particular, we obtain vertices and their  coupling constants.  We analyze the simplest extension to 5+1  and we find that an $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$  symmetry is predicted. The solutions will be  hence  related to physical  fields.  In Section II we study the  3+1 dimensional version of the new  equation  by considering  its symmetries and a  set of commuting operators characterizing the solutions. We also find  and analyze their   link to quantized fields. %POSSIBILITY OF ?   In Section III we present its bosons solutions, both at the massless and massive levels and in Section IV we study a particular reduction of the equation and its transformations leading to  fermion  solutions too. We argue that both versions of the field equation contain  a gauge invariance. In section V we present some conserved currents and, through them we find a link to   a vertex interaction between a pair of spin 1/2 particles and a boson, which is implied in the formalism.  In Section VI we generalize the equation to six dimensions using the 5+1 Clifford algebra and we analyze the embedded $4$-$d$ Clifford subalgebras, and corresponding symmetries. We  show that for  one subalgebra chain an $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ symmetry is implied. In Section VII  we present the massless solutions and link these symmetries to the isospin and hypercharge generators, respectively.  In Section VIII  we present the massive ones. In Section IX we link these solutions to  physical fields in the SM, and obtain the fermion-vector couplings and  coupling constants. In Section  X we summarize this work, indicate its main results, and draw conclusions.         % CHANGE ORGANIZATION? GENERALIZED EQ.  VECTORS. FERMIONS. \section{{Generalized field equation from   Dirac formalism } We search for a description of vectors and scalars as close as exists for fermions in order to be able to relate both representations. We also demand that the  field equation which  provides this description be  enclosed in a variational principle framework. Indeed, these requirements   are achieved by generalizing Dirac's equation and extending its multiplet content.  At this point we concentrate  only on the free particle case and later on we will show how interactions are implied in this formalism. Then,  instead of assuming the Dirac operator acts on a spinor (Dirac, 1947) %\cite{{Dirac} \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Diraceq} ( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M) \psi=0, \end{{eqnarray} where $\psi$ is the column vector with components $  \psi_\alpha$,  we  assume  it acts on a $4\times 4$ matrix $\Psi$ with components $\Psi_{{\alpha \beta}$ so that the equation becomes \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeq} ( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M)\Psi ={{ 0}. \end{{eqnarray} The form of this equation implies   all symmetry operators valid for the Dirac equation in eq. \ref{{Diraceq} (with its corresponding particular cases of massless and massive cases)  will be valid as well for it. The operators therefore satisfy the Poincar\'e algebra. There  are other possible Lorentz-invariant terms that could enter eq. \ref{{Jaimeq};  further justification for the choice of the terms in this equation is related to a gauge symmetry  described in Section IV.   We postulate all transformations and symmetry operations on the Dirac operator $( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M)\rightarrow %SHOULD WE CHANGE THE ORDER? {{U}(\it  i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M) {{U^{{-1}}$ induce a corresponding transformation \begin{{eqnarray} \label  {{transfo}  \Psi \rightarrow U \Psi U^\dagger. \end{{eqnarray} Here, the lhs $U$ is fixed by the Dirac operator transformations but there is a liberty for the rhs term, whose choice will shortly prove its utility. With this assumption the elements of $\Psi $, which can be expanded in terms of the tensor product  of two spinors $\sum_{{i,j} a_{{ij} |w_i \rangle\langle w_j |$, are expected to Lorentz transform as scalars, vectors and antisymmetric tensors. We  will show below modified symmetry operators classify some  solutions as fermions too. %THIS SEEMED TO BE WRONG %The equivalence to eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} follows from the assumption that %the action of the operator $\gamma_0( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu +M)$ on the right hand side %is null;    The vector space spanned by the matrix solutions  allows to define  an algebra to which  they belong and which is closed. By using the matrix product, if ${{ A}$, ${{ B}$ are solutions, the new field \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{field algebra} {{ C}={{ AB}, \end{{eqnarray} is another element of the algebra which may  or may not  be a solution, but lives in the same vector space. We find here a connection to QFT as we have  an  algebra of operator solutions. In fact, we will show the product  among fields leads to interactions among them.     The  quantum mechanical dot product of ${{ A}$, ${{ B}$ is defined  by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{pointproduct}    \langle  {{ A} | {{ B} \rangle =tr({{ A^\dagger B}). \end{{eqnarray} A trace of over the coordinates is also implied. This definition satisfies the usual properties expected for a measure. % and will be used                                  DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION %to express  zero components of %conserved currents whose form is given below. The use of the  product in eq. \ref{{field algebra} implies the number of terms entering the point product is not restrained  and it may include more than two fields to be evaluated. Expectation values of operators or any matrix element with the overlap of two solutions can   therefore  be defined from here. An interpretation of these products requires also taking care of the Lorentz structure.  We note  transformation \ref{{transfo} is  also valid for hermitian conjugated fields $\Psi^\dagger$, which satisfy the equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeqdagger} {{ 0}={{ \Psi}^\dagger ( -i \stackrel{{\leftarrow}{{\partial_\mu}{{\gamma^\mu}^\dagger -M). \end{{eqnarray} We will  extend our space of solutions by considering also combinations  of  fields ${{ A}$, ${{ B}^\dagger$,   \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{campechana}  {{ A}+{{ B}^\dagger, \end{{eqnarray} respectively satisfying eqs. \ref{{Jaimeq} and \ref{{Jaimeqdagger}. In fact, it is by taking account also  of these fields, that we can span the function space on the  32-dimensional  complex $4 \times 4$ matrices.   %NOT NEEDED FOR THE TIME BEING % Although it is possible to translate this description into a form where $ M$ is %written as %a column matrix by using   higher dimensional Dirac matrices we will not follow this %approach here. {{\bf Conserved Operators}  We shall be interested in plane-wave solutions of the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{planewaves} {{ \Psi}^{{(+)}_k(x)&=&{{ u}(k)e^{{-i kx}\\ {{ \Psi}^{{(-)}_k(x)&=& {{ v}(k)e^{{i kx}, \label{{planewavesend}  \end{{eqnarray} where $k^\mu$ is the momentum  four-vector $(E,\bf k)$, $k_0=E$.  By putting eq.  \ref{{Jaimeq} into   Hamiltonian form and using the  plane-wave  states of eqs. \ref{{planewaves}, \ref{{planewavesend} each spinor  satisfies respectively the stationary equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{statioJau} \gamma_0(   {{\bf k }\cdot{{\boldmathgamma}+ M){{ u}(k)=E {{ u}(k) \end{{eqnarray}  and \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{statioJav} \gamma_0( -  {{\bf k }\cdot{{\boldmathgamma}+ M){{ v}(k)=-E {{ v}(k), \end{{eqnarray}  with ${{\boldmathgamma}=(\gamma^1,\gamma^2,\gamma^3)$. To classify the solutions we use the Hamiltonian \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Hamilto} H=\gamma_0(  {{\bf k }\cdot{{\boldmathgamma}+ M) \end{{eqnarray} and the Pauli-Lubansky vector \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{PauliL}  W_\mu=-\frac{{1}{{2}\epsilon_{{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}J^{{\nu\rho}p^\sigma, \end{{eqnarray} constructed from  the Lorentz-transformation generators \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{angular}  J_{{\mu\nu}=i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu)+\frac{{1}{{2}\sigma_{{\mu\nu}, \end{{eqnarray}with the spin operators given by  \begin{{eqnarray}  \label{{sigma} \sigma_{{\mu\nu}=\frac{{i}{{2}[\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu],  \end{{eqnarray} and   momentum operator \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{momentum} %% p^\mu=i \stackrel{{\leftrightarrow}{{\partial^\mu} .  p^\mu=i {{\partial^\mu}. \end{{eqnarray} $W_\mu$  is projected over the  space-like four-vector $n_k$, orthogonal to the momentum,   of norm $-1$ (the conventions for the norm $g_{{\mu\nu}$ are given in the appendix) \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{nk}   n_k=( \frac{{{{ | \bf k}| }{{M}, \frac{{ E {{\bf k} }{{M | {{\bf k} |   } ), \end{{eqnarray} giving \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{projeW} \frac{{1}{{M}W\cdot n_k={{\bf \Sigma}\cdot{{\bf \hat k  }, \end{{eqnarray} where \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Sigma} {{\bf \Sigma}=\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma_5\gamma_0{{\boldmathgamma}. \end{{eqnarray} The definition in eq. \ref{{projeW} is valid both for the massless and the massive cases.  \noindent {{\bf Solutions as  quantized fields}  Consistency of the definition \ref{{transfo} when applied to the generator of time translations, the Hamiltonian, implies formally that the energy  should be obtained by taking the commutator \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeqcomm} [\gamma_0( -i {{\bf \nabla}\cdot{{\boldmathgamma}+M),\Psi ] \end{{eqnarray} This operation calls for a rule on the action of the derivative on the right.  We will proceed heuristically here and apply the transformation rule $p^\mu\rightarrow k^\mu$ on  $H$. We apply the same rule on the  $\frac{{1}{{M}W\cdot n_k$  operator, which leads to ${{\bf \Sigma}\cdot{{\bf \hat k  }$. This prescription is already taken into account  in   eqs.  \ref {{Hamilto} and \ref{{projeW} and is as expected for spin-derivative operators acting on a tensor product space.  We shall use this assignment for these operators which classify the solutions throughout this paper.  As a bonus, we obtain that hermitian conjugates of negative energy solutions have positive energies with the opposite spin $s$, just as occurs  in QFT, which in turn reproduces hole theory. Indeed, assuming for the $v(k)$ component of ${{ \Psi}^{{(-)}_k(x)$ in eq. \ref{{planewavesend}, \begin{{eqnarray}  [H   ,v(k) ]=-E  v(k)\\ \label{{negenr} [-{{\bf \Sigma}\cdot {{\bf {{\hat k}  } ,v(k) ]= s  v(k) \end{{eqnarray}  we find that for the hermitian conjugate wave function field $v^\dagger(k)e^{{-ikx}$, satisfying eq. \ref{{Jaimeqdagger}, \begin{{eqnarray}  [H   ,v^\dagger(k)]= E  v^\dagger(k) \\ \label{{holes} [-{{\bf \Sigma}\cdot{{\bf {{\hat k } } , v^\dagger(k) ]=- s  v^\dagger(k). \end{{eqnarray}  We expect a more formal justification of this operation will be given in the rigorous context of  QFT. In addition, consistency with eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} will require  a choice of the normalization for agreement with the energy $E$. %However,   in both cases a non-vanishing value of $W\cdot n_k$  when %acting on the right of  $\Psi$ requires the substitution  from the operator to the quantum number  % ; we shall as well  invoke %heuristically %arguments based on this description. % Then, we assume all operators considered here %act in the context of a many-body Hilbert space with the no-particle one representing %the vacuum. % We shall assume one-body operators act on a % homogeneous vacuum  which implies the second part of the commutator vanishes %for the derivative part. This implies eq. \ref{{Jaimeqcomm} gives the same results %as \ref{{Jaimeq} for the massless case. For the massive case the two equations  will differ due to %the mass term.  %When using this prescription yet for $H$ its operation on $\Psi$ is modified.  \section{{Vectors, scalars, and antisymmetric tensors }   \noindent {{\bf Massless solutions}  The massless equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeqmle}  i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu  {{\Psi}= {{ 0} \end{{eqnarray} leads to the expressions for the  operators in   eqs.  \ref {{Hamilto} and \ref{{projeW}, assuming (from here and for all massless solutions, except when otherwise stated) that the space component of  momentum $k^\mu$ is along the  $\hat{{ \bf z}$ direction, \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{defop}  {{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }} =\frac{{i}{{2} \gamma_1\gamma_2 , \\ \label{{defoHmls} H/k_0=\gamma_0\gamma^3, \end{{eqnarray} where the former is the helicity operator and latter is the Hamiltonian   divided by the energy.    The polarization components of the  solutions of eq. \ref{{Jaimeqmle}, bilinear in the $\gamma$s, are given  on Tables \ref{{VmA}, \ref{{VpA}.  We set the coordinate dependence as \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{coordep} {{ \Psi}^{{(+)V-A }_{{ki}(x)&=&{{ u}_i({{k} )e^{{-i kx}\\ {{ \Psi}^{{(+)V+A }_{{ki}(x)&=&\tilde {{ u}_i({{k} )e^{{-i kx}. \end{{eqnarray} They are given together with their quantum numbers corresponding to the operators in eqs. \ref{{defop}, \ref{{defoHmls}. The solutions are also eigenfunctions of these operators $O$ in the simple form $O{{ u}_i({{k} )= \lambda {{ u}_i({{k} )$ and we present the eigenvalues $\lambda$ too, where here and throughout  the solutions are normalized  as, e. g., \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{normalization} tr( \bfut ^\dagger_  {{i}( {{k)} \bfut_{{i}( {{k)}) =1. \end{{eqnarray} %e^{{i \bf  p\cdot\hat {{\bf x}}   dependence out % put tilde 1 or -1 ? %FALTA numero i en igualdad %SEE THAT HERE NEITHER v, u are boldfaced, but on the other hand, argument is, unlike above definition.

Put other form to all or take out? Correct others Solutions $\bfu_{{-1}({{k})$, $\bfut_{{1}( {{k} )$ correspond to on-shell particles with transverse polarizations but opposite helicities,  while  the off-shell $\bfu_{{0}({{k})$, $\bfut_{{0}( {{k} )$ are polarized in the  longitudinal-scalar directions. All these solutions correspond  to waves propagating  in the $\hat {{\bf z}$ direction.  The other terms propagate in the   $-\hat {{\bf z}$ direction, which is represented by  four-vector  $\tilde  k^\mu=k_\mu$,   and are classified with the appropriate  relations as eqs. \ref{{defop} and \ref{{defoHmls}.  The coordinate dependence of these solutions is given by \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{coordeptil} {{ \Psi}^{{(+)}_{{\tilde k i}(x)&=&{{ \bfu}_i({{\tilde k} )e^{{-i  \tilde k x }.  \end{{eqnarray}  These solutions  do not represent independent polarization components as e.g.  $\bfu_{{i}({{\tilde k})$ can be obtained by rotating the $\bfu_{{i}({{k})$.  The classification $V$+$A$ and $V$-$A$,   consisting respectively of the   $\bfut _{{i}$ and $\bfu _{{i}$ terms,  corresponds to specifying the weight of vector and axial components, which is further clarified  below. These two types of  solutions  are also characterized by the two vector spaces projected  by $\frac{{1}{{2} (1+\gamma_5)$ and $\frac{{1}{{2} (1-\gamma_5)$ which they generate respectively but which they do not exhaust. We need to consider the negative energy solutions \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{coordepv} {{ \Psi}^{{(-)}_{{ki}(x)&=& {{ v}_i({{k} )e^{{i kx} \end{{eqnarray} and  use their hermitian conjugates, which in fact generate other polarization components, in order to   completely   span the space. In the massless case we have negative energy solutions ${{ v}_{{ i}({{k} )=\bfu_{{i}(k)$,  $\tilde {{ v}_{{ i}({{k} )=\bfut_{{i}(k)$ (and $\tilde k$ terms), that is, with opposite helicities. The  combinations of the type \ref{{campechana} $\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}[\tilde {{ u }_i({{k})\pm\tilde {{ v }_{{ i} ^\dagger(k)] e^{{-i    kx}$,  $\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}[{{ u }_i({{k})\pm {{ v }_{{  i}^\dagger (k)  ] e^{{-i    kx} $ $({{ v }_{{  i}^\dagger (k)\equiv[{{ v }_{{  i}(k)]^\dagger )$    will be interpreted as vector solutions with varied polarizations. The chirality operator $\gamma_5$ further characterizes these solutions as non-chiral since,  using  rule \ref{{transfo}, it gives $[\gamma_5 ,\Psi ]=0$. The most general form of the solutions can be obtained by rotating and boosting these solutions through a Lorentz transformation, using $J_{{\mu\nu }$ in eq. \ref{{angular}.  Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq}  also satisfies  the discrete invariances of time,  and  space inversion, and charge conjugation, expressed  respectively by the operators \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{CPT} T&=&i\gamma_1\gamma_3 \mathcal{{K} \mathcal{{T}   \label{{T} \\ P&=&\gamma_0 \wp  \label{{P} \\ C&=&i\gamma_2 \mathcal{{K} \label{{C}, \end{{eqnarray} where $\mathcal{{K}$ is the complex conjugation operator $\mathcal{{K}$$ i $$\mathcal{{K}=$$-i$,  $\mathcal{{T}$ changes $t\rightarrow -t$, and $\wp$  changes ${{\bf x}\rightarrow -{{\bf x}$ and  consequently ${{\bf p}\rightarrow -{{\bf p}$;  we use the Dirac representation for the $\gamma_\mu$ matrices (see appendix). It is then possible to form combinations of the above solutions transforming as vectors and as axial vectors. For example, the combination  \begin{{eqnarray}  \label{{goodparity}   {{ \Psi} _{{k {{\hat x} }  = \frac{{i}{{2}[ \tilde {{ u }_1({{k})+{{ u }_{{-1}({{k})+ \tilde {{ v }_{{1}^ \dagger (k) + {{ v }_{{-1}^\dagger (k)   ] e^{{-i    kx} =\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_0\gamma_1 e^{{-i    kx}  \end{{eqnarray} represents  a vector particle linearly polarized along $\hat {{\bf x}$, that is, it transforms  into $-{{ \Psi}_{{k{{\hat x} } ({{\tilde x})$ under $P$, with $\tilde  x_\mu=x^\mu$. In general  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Amufirst} {{ A}_\mu(x) =\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_0\gamma_\mu e^{{-i    kx} \end{{eqnarray} (and the corresponding negative energy solution)  transforms  into ${{ A}^\mu({{\tilde x})$ under $P$, into ${{ A}^\mu(-{{\tilde x})$ under $T$,  and into $-{{ A}_\mu({{-x})$ under $C$.  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{AmufirstAx} {{ A} _ {{5\mu} (x) =\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_5\gamma_0\gamma_\mu e^{{-i    kx} \end{{eqnarray} transforms  into $-{{ A}^{{\mu}_5 ({{\tilde x})$ under $P$, into ${{ A}_5^\mu(-{{\tilde x})$ under $T$,    and into ${{ A}_{{5\mu}({{-x})$ under $C$. The combination $ {{ A}_\mu(x)  +C {{ A}_\mu(x) C^\dagger$ transforms into minus itself under charge conjugation, as expected for a non-axial vector. Given the quantum numbers of  ${{ A}_\mu(x)$  it becomes possible to relate it  to the vector potential of an electromagnetic field. Indeed, similar mixtures of   ${{ \tilde u}$, ${{\tilde  v}^\dagger$, ${{ u}$, and ${{ v}^\dagger$  solutions have been shown, under certain conditions, to satisfy  Maxwell's equations (Bargmann, Wigner, 1948). %\cite{{Bargmann}.   The remaining eight degrees of freedom   in the massless case are classified into six forming an antisymmetric tensor  and two scalars, which as solutions appear mixed. The chirality $\gamma_5$ further divides them into left and right-handed.  Their respective coordinate dependence is \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{coordepw} {{ \Psi}^{{(+)-}_{{ki}(x)&=&{{ w}_i({{k} )e^{{-i kx}\\ {{ \Psi}^{{(+)+}_{{ k i}(x)&=&\tilde{{ w}_i({{ k} )e^{{-i  k x } \label{{coordepwtilde}  \end{{eqnarray} (and corresponding definitions for $\tilde k$) and the explicit form of the matrix components together with their quantum numbers is shown on  Tables \ref{{eigenantis}, \ref{{eigsend}. \begin{{table}[h] \begin{{eqnarray}\nonumber Scalars\  and\ antisymmetric\ tensors &   \gamma_0\gamma^3 & \frac{{i}{{2} \gamma_1\gamma_2\ \ [ H/k_0,\ ]   \ \  [{{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  p} }} ,\ ] \nonumber  \\ \bfw_{{0} ({{k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma _5) ( \gamma_0 +\gamma _3)& 1 & -1/2 \ \ 2 \ \ 0  \nonumber\\ \bfw_{{0} ({{ \tilde k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma _5)  ( \gamma_0 -\gamma _3)& -1 & 1/2 \ \  2 \ \ 0 \nonumber \\ \bfw_{{-1}({{k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5)(\gamma_1  -i\gamma _2)& 1 &  -1/2 \ \ 0 \ \ -1 \nonumber \\ \bfw_{{-1}({{\tilde k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5)(\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)& -1 & 1/2 \ \  0 \ \ -1  \nonumber   %NOTESE QUE %LA TILDE VA CON EL +, ya que la chirality es NEGATIVA \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{left-handed bosons.\label{{eigenantis} } \end{{table}  \begin{{table} \begin{{eqnarray}\nonumber Scalars\  and\ antisymmetric\ tensors &   \gamma_0\gamma^3 & \frac{{i}{{2} \gamma_1\gamma_2\ \ [ H/k_0,\ ] \nonumber  \ \  [{{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  p} }} ,\ ] \nonumber  \\ \bfwt_{{0} ({{ k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1+\gamma_5)(\gamma_0+\gamma_3)& 1 & 1/2 \ \  2  \ \ 0 \nonumber\\  \bfwt_{{0} ({{ \tilde  k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1+\gamma_5)(\gamma_0-\gamma_3)& -1 & -1/2 \ \  2 \ \ 0  \nonumber\\ %CHECK NUMBERS \bfwt_{{1} ({{ k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1+\gamma_5)(\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)& 1 & 1/2 \ \  0 \ \   1  \nonumber\\ \bfwt_{{1} ({{ \tilde   k})=\frac{{1}{{4}  (1+\gamma_5)(\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)& -1 & -1/2 \ \  0 \ \   1  \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{right-handed bosons.\label{{eigsend}} \end{{table}   To see these terms have this interpretation we should apply transformation \ref{{transfo} with $U$ containing a Lorentz transformation, acting on $1 {{ \Psi}=\gamma_0\gamma_0 {{ \Psi}$, which leads to  $U^\dagger \gamma_0=\gamma_0 U^{{-1}$. Labeling the antisymmetric terms by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{laanti} {{ A } _{{\mu\nu}=\frac{{1}{{4}\gamma_ 0 [\gamma_ \mu,\gamma_ \nu],  \end{{eqnarray}  and the scalar and pseudoscalar terms by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{lascapse}  {{\phi}=\frac{{1}{{2} \gamma_0, \\  {{\phi_5}=\frac{{1}{{2} \gamma_0\gamma_5, \end{{eqnarray}  the expressions  on Tables \ref{{eigenantis}, \ref{{eigsend}  can be written in terms of $A_{{\mu\nu}$,  $\phi$, and $\phi_5$. This requires also hermitian conjugates of negative energy solutions \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{coordepwneg} {{ \Psi}^{{(-)-}_{{ki}(x)&=&{{ z}_i({{k} )e^{{i kx}\\ {{ \Psi}^{{(-)+}_{{\tilde k i}(x)&=&\tilde {{ z}_i({{ k} )e^{{i k x }, \label{{coordepwtildeneg}  \end{{eqnarray} where ${{ z}_{{i}({{k} )=\bfw_{{i}(k)$,  $\tilde {{ z}_{{i}({{k} )=\bfwt_{{i}(k)$ (and $\tilde k$ terms). While the scalar and pseudoscalar particles obtained have a straightforward interpretation as on-shell particles the antisymmetric solutions do not have a recognizable interpretation, given that their on-shell components do not have transverse polarizations. A  vector interpretation  can be given using the identities \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{identities}  \bfwt_{{i}({{k}) =\frac{{1}{{2|{{\bf k}|}\not\! k  \bfu_{{-i}({{\tilde k}),\ \  \bfwt_{{i}({{\tilde k}) =\frac{{1}{{2|{{\bf k}|}\not\! {{\tilde k}  \bfu_{{-i}({{k}),  \\ \nonumber \bfw_{{-i}({{k}) =\frac{{1}{{2|{{\bf k}|}\not\!{{k}  \bfut_{{i}({{\tilde k}),\ \ \bfw_{{-i}({{\tilde k}) = \frac{{1}{{2|{{\bf k}|}\not\! \tilde k \bfut_{{i}({{k}),  \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} and similar expressions for negative energy solutions. The gauge symmetry discussed below suggests some of these  solutions may be gauged out.    %CREO QUE LO QUE SIGUE ESTA TODO MAL %The requirement that solutions \ref{{eigenantis}-\ref{{eigsend} %belong to the same Lorentz representation forces us toR %reinnterpret  one or   two of their components. In the simplest interpretation we can represent %them as scalars, vectors or tensors.  %This can be obtained by assuming one or two of the vectors $\gamma_\mu$ is contracted with %a vector; at the same time the solution must not be altered. %One simple  such  contraction that puts both types of components into a vector representation %is obtained by making the substitution $\gamma_0\rightarrow \gamma_\mu n^\mu$ % where $n^\mu$ is the timelike four-vector $n=(1,{{\bf 0})$ %(If $\bf M$ is a solution so will $[\partial,\bf M]$.

In general, we can show the solutions generate a quadrivector basis whose  components can be given in a spherical or in  a vector basis.  A set of corresponding polarization vectors  $\epsilon^{{(\lambda)}(k)$ can be defined which coincide with the directions  that some of the actual solutions in  Tables  \ref{{VmA}, \ref{{VpA}  and \ref{{eigenantis}, \ref{{eigsend} take. We define a unitary  vector $n$, along the time direction, that is, $n^2=1$. %$n_k$ orthogonal to $k$: $n_{{k\mu}=tile k_\mu=k^\mu$. Then $k^\mu n_{{k\mu}=0$. Assuming a general $k$ we choose $\epsilon^{{(1)}(k)$, and $\epsilon^{{(2)}(k)$ in the transverse directions, orthogonal to $k$ and $n$, and   $\epsilon^{{(\lambda)}(k)\cdot\epsilon^{{(\lambda^\prime)}(k)=- \delta^{{\lambda\lambda^\prime}$. Then we pick $\epsilon^{{(3)}(k)$, the  longitudinal vector,   along the plane $k$-$n$ and orthogonal to $n$ and $\epsilon^{{(0)}(k)$, the   scalar component,  along $n$. These vectors are orthogonal among themselves: \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{orthogoneps} \epsilon^{{(\lambda)}(k)\cdot\epsilon^{{(\lambda^\prime)}(k)= g^{{\lambda\lambda^\prime}. \end{{eqnarray} %put here further relations among vectors?  In the case of  the  solutions $\tilde u_i$ on Table  \ref{{VpA}, which propagate along $\pm\bf {{\hat z}$,  the polarization vectors in the  spherical basis are \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{polarizsim} e^{{ (1)}(k)&=& \bfut_1({{k}) , \\ e^{{ (2)}(k)&=&  \bfut_1({{\tilde k}) , \\ e ^{{ (3)}(k)&=&\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}} (\bfut_0({{\tilde k})-\bfut_0({{ k})), \\ e^{{ (0)}(k)&=&\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}} (\bfut_0({{\tilde k}) +\bfut_0({{ k})) \end{{eqnarray} The associated vector form of the polarizations is given by $\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{2}}(1+\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$. In fact, the sixteen  components of the four vectors  $\epsilon^{{(\lambda)}(k)$ form a tensor which connect among the two bases. %CHECK THIS WORD The components are obtained from \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{polarizcompo} \epsilon^{{(\lambda)}_\mu=tr(e^{{*(\lambda)}(k)\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{2}}(1+\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\mu), \end{{eqnarray} where we use the conjugate polarizations \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{polariz} e^{{*(1)}(k) &=&\frac{{1}{{4 }(1+\gamma_5)(\gamma_1-i \gamma_2)\gamma_0 \\ e^{{*(2)}(k)&=&\frac{{1}{{4 }(1+\gamma_5)(\gamma_1+i \gamma_2)\gamma_0 \\ e^{{*(3)}(k)&=&\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{2}} (1+\gamma_5)\gamma_3\gamma_0\\ e^{{*(0)}(k)&=&\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{2}}(1+\gamma_5). \end{{eqnarray}   For the  non-axial vectors of the form \ref{{goodparity} the terms  $\frac{{1}{{{{2}}\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$ constitute the the vector basis. Indeed, we can use the relation \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{orthogon} tr[(\gamma_0\gamma_\mu)(\gamma_0\gamma_\nu )]=tr[(\gamma^\mu\gamma_0)(\gamma_0\gamma_\nu )]=4 g_{{\ \nu}^\mu \end{{eqnarray} in order to project precisely those components; namely, we should seek \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{components} C_{{\Psi}^\mu=tr(\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma^\mu\gamma_0 \Psi) \end{{eqnarray} %where we obtain non-zero components for solutions \ref{{righthand}-\ref{{lefthandend} %check notation ($\gamma_0$ is included to account for the other  $\gamma_0$ factor  that is  included in the solutions).  For solutions $w_i$, $\tilde w_i$ on Tables \ref{{eigenantis}, \ref{{eigsend}   an orthonormal vector basis can be found in the vector interpretation of eq. \ref{{identities} which contains them. This is obtained by using, for example, the vectors \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{orthogonoth} b^\mu=i\gamma_0\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{-\Box}}(\gamma^\mu {{\not\! \partial}+ \sqrt{{2}\partial^\mu ) \\ {{b^\mu}^*=-i\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{-\Box}}(\gamma^\mu {{\not\! \partial}- \sqrt{{2}\partial^\mu )\gamma_0 \nonumber \end{{eqnarray}  which also satisfy \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{orthogongamma} tr(b_\mu^* b_\nu )=g_{{\mu\nu}, \end{{eqnarray}  as can be shown by using the relation $tr(\gamma_\mu\not\!\partial\gamma_\nu{{\not\! \partial })=4   (2 \partial_\mu\partial_\nu-g_{{\mu\nu}\Box)$. The presence of the $\partial_\mu$ in these expressions uses the fact that we may generate a vector solution from a scalar by taking the derivative. Given that we have constructed solutions that satisfy Dirac's equation \ref{{Diraceq} it follows the solutions will also satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation. This means that when  projecting the  solutions on vectors \ref{{orthogonoth} these can only be defined as a limiting case as the $\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{-\Box}}$ operator is  singular when applied on the solutions.   \noindent {{\bf Gauge invariance}  A clue for the  interpretation  of all massless solutions described so far is suggested by the fact that  eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} is invariant to first order under a set of gauge  transformations,  that is, with local dependence, which implies some are spurious.  % CHECK THIS STATEMENT These symmetries turn out to be %trivial when considering Dirac's equation (\ref {{Diraceq}), but they are not when %applied in the sense of eq. In trying to generate this transformation we expect it  to be unitary and Lorentz invariant. However, we can only present a transformation satisfying either property but not both together. However, we expect that it satisfy both properties when applied on the space of solutions. This is reminiscent of the QFT case.   We now consider the  transformation $U_G=e^{{iG}$ with a similar  sense to eq. \ref{{transfo}, with generator  $G={{\not\! \partial a(x)}$, and $a(x)$ any real  function, where we use  the form $H\rightarrow  \tilde U ^\dagger H \tilde U$. When applying the corresponding  infinitesimal transformation   to the operator $i\gamma_0 {{\not\! \partial}$ we need to consider only the  commutator (or anticommutator, if we take $i{{\not\! \partial a(x)}$  as the generator) with the Dirac operator, which contains \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{commugaugetrans} [\not\! \partial,\not\! \partial a(x)]_\pm= \Box a(x) \pm \partial_\mu a(x)\partial_\nu \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu. \end{{eqnarray} The (anti-)commutator  with the operator $a(x)\not\! \partial$ gives \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{commugaugeoth} [\not\! \partial ,a(x)\not\! \partial ]_\pm= \partial_\mu a(x) \partial_\nu \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu\pm a(x) \Box. \end{{eqnarray} From these equations we see  $U_{{G^a}=e^{{i G^a } $, where \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{genegaugeg} G^a= \not\!\partial a(x)+{{a(x)\not\!\partial} \end{{eqnarray} (or the transformation with generator $\not\!\partial a(x)-{{a(x)\not\!\partial}$) will be invariant to first order provided $\Box a(x)+2 \partial_\mu a(x) k^\mu=0$. Consequently, the  symmetry is linked to the space of solutions. We also get a cancellation to  second order in $G^a$ if $\Box a(x)=0$, and $ \partial_\mu a(x) k^\mu=0$  are satisfied. We note these  conditions mean $a(x)$ satisfies the massless Klein-Gordon equation in a reduced number of directions.  Although $U_{{G^a}$ is a Lorentz-invariant operator it is not hermitian.  The term \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{genegaugeg5} G_5^b=i[b(x)\gamma_5\not\! \partial+ {{\gamma_5 \not\! \partial b(x)}] \end{{eqnarray} under the conditions  $\Box b(x)=0$ and  $\partial_\mu b(x) k^\mu=0$ is similarly the generator  of another symmetry   operator $U_{{G_5^b}=e^{{i G_5^b}$ since \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{commugaugeg5} [\not\! \partial, \gamma_5 \not\! \partial b(x)]_\pm= \gamma_5 (-\Box b(x) \pm \partial_\mu b(x)\partial_\nu \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu), \end{{eqnarray} and \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{commugaugetransg5} [\not\! \partial ,b(x)\gamma_5 \not\! \partial ]_\pm= \gamma_5(- \partial_\mu b(x) \partial_\nu \gamma^\mu \gamma^\nu\pm b(x) \Box). \end{{eqnarray} The  case with different $V,$ $A$ contributions is  considered below.  We have obtained   two sets of local transformations  restrained  by the condition on  the functions $a(x)$ and $b(x)$.   We may understand this as a manifestation of a gauge symmetry, where we  attribute  the restriction to  the choice  of gauge. Indeed, we find a  similarity with the gauge invariance  of the  electromagnetic field $A_\mu$. The Lorentz  gauge condition  (Lorentz invariant) for it \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Lorentz} \partial^\mu A_\mu=0 \end{{eqnarray} reduces Maxwell's equations to \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Maxwell} \Box A_\mu=0. \end{{eqnarray} In this case  the gauge freedom is reduced to transformations $A_\mu\rightarrow A_\mu+ \partial_\mu \phi$, where $\phi$ satisfies $\Box \phi=0$. The fact that solutions on Tables \ref{{VmA}, \ref{{VpA} and \ref{{eigenantis}, \ref{{eigsend}  also satisfy the massless Klein-Gordon equation  supports the interpretation of these solutions as vector particles satisfying Maxwell's equation within the Lorentz gauge. In fact, these solutions resemble more the case of the quantized electromagnetic field in this gauge. It is easy to see that this set of solutions does not satisfy eq. \ref{{Lorentz}. However,  eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} can be interpreted as implying that the Lorentz condition is satisfied in the mean, a condition required for the quantized electromagnetic field \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{quanLorentz}  \partial^\mu A_\mu|\psi\rangle =0, \end{{eqnarray}  where $|\psi\rangle $  describes states from the electromagnetic field. To put eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} in this form we only need to use combined solutions as obtained in eq. \ref{{goodparity}.  It is interesting that in our case eq. \ref{{quanLorentz} is  a condition that we derive and not one that we impose additionally from gauge fixing. We therefore obtain again a connection to QFT. The suggested gauge symmetry  also would imply not all the solutions in the fields on Tables \ref{{eigenantis},\ref{{eigsend} are independent, but rather that they could be obtained from the fields on Tables  \ref{{VmA}, \ref{{VpA} by a gauge transformation.  %CHECK THIS STATEMENT IS THE GAUGE SYMMETRY NOT TRIVIAL The presence of a gauge symmetry places constraints on the choices of terms in a quantum relativistic equation, as happens in QFT. Thus, here we find a justification for the choice of Lorentz-invariant terms in eq.  \ref{{Jaimeq}. %PUT IN CONCLUSIONS?  \noindent   {{\bf Massive solutions}   In order to describe the solutions of eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} with $M \not= 0$  we choose the rest frame so that they only have time dependence \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{massplanewaves} {{ \Psi}^{{(+)M}_{{ki}(x)&=&{{ U_i}(k)e^{{-i Mt}\\ {{ \Psi}^{{(-)M}_{{ki}(x)&=& {{ V_i}(k)e^{{i Mt}. \label{{massplanewavesend}  \end{{eqnarray} The matrix components are classified by the eigenvalue of the parity operator $P$ into the  $P=-1$ group on Table \ref{{massivesol} \begin{{table}[h] \begin{{eqnarray}\nonumber Massive\ bosons & \gamma_0 & \frac{{i}{{2} \gamma_1\gamma_2\ \ [ H/k_0,\ ]   \ \  [{{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }} ,\ ] \nonumber \\  {{{{ U}}_{{1}(M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1+\gamma _0) (\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)&  1 & 1/2 \ \  2\ \ 1 \nonumber \\ {{{{ V}}_{{1}(M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma _0) (\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)& -1 & 1/2 \ \  -2 \ \ 1  \nonumber\\ {{{{ U}}_ {{-1} (M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1+\gamma _0) (\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)& 1 & -1/2 \ \  2 \ \ -1 \nonumber \\ {{{{ V}}_ {{-1} (M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} ( 1-\gamma _0) (\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)& -1 & -1/2 \ \ -2\ \ -1  \nonumber\\ {{{{ U}}_ {{0}(M,{{\bf 0})=  \frac{{1}{{4} (1+\gamma _0) ( \gamma_5 -\gamma _3)&  1&  1/2  \ \ 2\ \  0 \nonumber\\ {{{{ V}}_{{0}(M,{{\bf 0})=  \frac{{1}{{4}(1-\gamma _0)  ( \gamma_5+ \gamma _3)& -1 &  1/2  \ \ -2 \ \  0 \nonumber\\  {{{{ U}}_{{\tilde 0}(M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1+\gamma _0) ( \gamma_5 +\gamma _3)&  1 & -1/2 \ \ 0  \ \  2\ \ 0 \nonumber \\ \nonumber  {{{{ V}}_{{\tilde 0} (M,{{\bf 0})=  \frac{{1}{{4}(1-\gamma _0)  ( \gamma_5- \gamma _3)& -1 & -1/2 \ \ -2 \ \  0 \label{{massivesolend} \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{Parity   $P=-1$ massive bosons.\label{{massivesol}} \end{{table} and $P=1$ group on  Table \ref{{massivesolPmend} \begin{{table}[h] \begin{{eqnarray}\nonumber Massive\ bosons  & \gamma_0 & \frac{{i}{{2}  \gamma_1\gamma_2\ \ [ H/k_0,\ ]   \ \  [{{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }} ,\ ] \nonumber \\ {{{{\bafut}}_{{1}(M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} \gamma_5(1-\gamma _0) (\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)& 1 & 1/2 \ \  0\ \ 1 \nonumber \\ {{{{\bafvt}}_{{1}(M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} \gamma_5(1+\gamma _0) (\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)& -1 & 1/2 \ \  0 \ \ 1 \nonumber \\ {{{{\bafut}}_ {{-1} (M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} \gamma_5(1-\gamma _0) (\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)& 1 & -1/2 \ \  0 \ \ -1 \nonumber\\  {{{{\bafvt}}_ {{-1} (M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4} \gamma_5( 1+\gamma _0) (\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)& -1 & -1/2 \ \ 0\ \ -1 \nonumber \\ {{{{\bafut}}_ {{0}(M,{{\bf 0})=  \frac{{1}{{4} \gamma_5(1-\gamma _0) ( \gamma_5 +\gamma _3)&  1&  1/2  \ \ 0 \ \  0 \nonumber\\   {{{{\bafvt}}_{{0}(M,{{\bf 0})=  \frac{{1}{{4}\gamma_5(1+\gamma _0)  ( \gamma_5- \gamma _3)& -1 &  1/2  \ \ 0 \ \  0 \nonumber\\ {{{{\bafut}}_{{\tilde 0}(M,{{\bf 0})= \frac{{1}{{4}\gamma_5 (1-\gamma _0) ( \gamma_5 -\gamma _3)&  1 & -1/2 \ \ 0  \ \  0\nonumber \\ \nonumber {{{{\bafvt}}_{{\tilde 0}(M,{{\bf 0})=  \frac{{1}{{4}\gamma_5(1+\gamma _0)  ( \gamma_5+ \gamma _3)& -1 & -1/2 \ \ 0 \ \  0 \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{Parity   $P=1$ massive bosons.\label{{massivesolPmend}} \end{{table} %FIND OUT THE DIFFERENCES WITH THE MASSLESS CASE (?) where the $\tilde 0$ subscript labels the solutions with negative  eigenvalue of $\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_1\gamma_2$. The solutions are classified with the aid of the normalized mass operator $H/M=\gamma_0$  and the helicity $\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_1 \gamma_2$ (this operator is obtained from the limiting case $|{{\bf k}|\rightarrow 0$ in eq. \ref{{projeW}). We note the solutions are mixed components of vector, antisymmetric and scalar components. We  can also construct combinations with definite  properties under the discrete transformations. Thus we find vectors  $\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$, axial vectors  $\gamma_5\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$, scalars $\gamma_0$, and pseudo-scalars $\gamma_5\gamma_0$. We obtain that the vectors become massive and  its longitudinal component becomes physical. Just as in the massless case,  an orthogonal  polarization basis can be defined.  For the pseudovector, its transverse and longitudinal components are not physical.   On the other hand, the condition that they all belong to a vector representation forces us to assume the antisymmetric and scalar terms  are in fact derivatives as in the massless case. %Only the time derivative is different from zero when applied to %solutions \ref{{massivesol} % One can simply reexpress these solutions in terms %of the vectors in eq. \ref{{ispossible}. We note also there remain two vector components constructed without internal spin, that is, constructed from derivatives of scalar particles.  This structure is reminiscent  of  the Higgs mechanism, in which massive vector fields absorb scalar degrees of freedom due to breaking of the symmetry.   \section{{Massless spin 1/2 particles }  We now show it is possible to give a Lorentz transformation  which describes fermions too. This is done more naturally  in the context of a matrix equation  of the type of eq. \ref{{Jaimeq}, and whose solutions are bosons and fermions. This constitutes progress  in the  task of giving a unified description of these fields. Indeed, we obtain solutions that under Lorentz transformations of the form \ref{{transfo} one of the sides transforms trivially,   and therefore, we get spin $1/2$ objects transforming  as the $(1/2,0)$ or $(0,1/2)$  representations  of the  Lorentz group.      The equation  \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeferq}   (1-\gamma_5)i \gamma_0\partial_\mu\gamma^\mu  {{  \Psi}=0 \end{{eqnarray} has  this type of solutions. The invariance algebra  of this equation contains the Lorentz generator \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Lorentzchi} J_{{\mu\nu}^-=\frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)J_{{\mu\nu}=\frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)[i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu)+ \frac{{1}{{2}\sigma_{{\mu\nu} ] \end{{eqnarray} (and  the other Poincar\'e generators). Among the solutions of eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq} we have again the $V$-$A$ vectors $u_i$ on Table   \ref{{VmA} which under the effect of $\frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5){{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}$ and $H/k_0=\frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma^3$ lead to the same quantum numbers.  The  Dirac operator in   eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq} is defined on a $2\times 2$ matrix space; nevertheless, the solutions lie in  the larger $4\times 4$ matrix space. It is precisely this structure which leads to a set of solutions classified as spin $1/2$ particles under  $J_{{\mu\nu}^-$. Actually, we have  as  additional symmetry of eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq}  the group of linear complex transformations $G(2,C)$ with eight components, generated by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{flavor} \frac{{1}{{2} (1+ \gamma_5),\  \   f_{{\mu\nu}=-\frac{{i}{{2}   (1+\gamma_5) \sigma_{{\mu\nu},\end{{eqnarray} where   $\sigma_{{\mu\nu}$ is given in eq. \ref{{sigma}. This means eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq} has   a freedom  in the choice  of the Lorentz transformation since,  e.g., both $J_{{\mu\nu}^-$ and $J_{{\mu\nu}$  are possible ones. The  $\bfw_{{i}$ terms on Table  \ref{{eigenantis} are also a set of solutions of eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq}. However, their interpretation changes to fermions when using $J^-_{{\mu\nu}$ to classify them. Clearly, the nature of the solutions  depends on the Hamiltonian and the set of transformations that we choose to classify them. But once our choice is made, there is no ambiguity. % We shall the assume  maximal symmetry classification hencefore. WHAT?   The unitary subgroups $SU(2)\times U(1)$  of the $G(2,C)$  symmetry operators in eq. \ref{{flavor} imply we have two additional  quantum numbers we can assign to the  solutions. In consideration that  this symmetry does not act on  the vector solution part, and taking account of the known quantum numbers  of fermions  in nature  we shall  associate these  operators with flavor and lepton number respectively. The  $SU(2)$ set of operators in \ref{{flavor} leads  to a flavor doublet.  The $U(1)$ is in this case not independent from the chirality. Choosing among the generators of  $SU(2)$  $f_{{30}$ to classify the solutions of eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq}, these   are given on Table \ref{{fermionsend}, \begin{{table} \begin{{eqnarray} Left-handed\  spin\ 1/2 \  particles &  \frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma^3 & \frac{{i}{{4} (1-\gamma_5)\gamma_1\gamma_2  \ \ [f_{{30},\ ] \nonumber \\ \bfw_{{-1/2}({{ k})  = \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5) (\gamma_0+\gamma_3 ) & 1 & -1/2\ \ 1/2 \nonumber\\ \bfw_{{-1/2}  ({{\tilde   k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5)  (\gamma_1+i\gamma_2 )& -1 & 1/2\ \ 1/2 \nonumber \\ \hat \bfw_{{-1/2}   ({{ k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5 ) (\gamma_1-i\gamma_2 )& 1 & -1/2\  -1/2\nonumber\\ \nonumber \hat \bfw_{{-1/2}({{ \tilde   k})  =  \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5) (\gamma_0-\gamma_3 ) & -1 & 1/2\ \ -1/2 \end{{eqnarray} %MAKE THEM RIGHT-HANDED TO RELATE TO Y acting on e^-_L ?{{mass \caption{{Massless  fermions. \label{{fermionsend}} \end{{table} where the hat is used to distinguish  the flavor and in this case the product and commutator of $H$ and  $\frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5){{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}$ give the same results. Eq. \ref{{coordepw}  can be used to obtain the full coordinate dependence. As  in the Weyl equation we obtain  solutions of a defined chirality or helicity. We have also negative energy solutions of the form \ref {{coordepwneg} whose hermitian conjugates are interpreted as right-handed  antiparticles. The latter could have been obtained by departing  from an    equation with $V$+$A$ solutions. In order to have a Dirac fermion and a fermion mass we need to have an equation mixing both chirality  solutions. These shall be obtained in Sections VII and VIII.   \noindent {{\bf Gauge invariance}  We  prove  eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq} has a gauge symmetry in the limiting case of $\alpha_+\rightarrow 0$ in \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeferqgauge} [ \alpha_+ \frac {{1}{{2}(1+\gamma_5) +\alpha_- \frac {{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5) ]i \gamma_0\partial_\mu\gamma^\mu {{  \Psi}=0. \end{{eqnarray} Using   eqs. \ref{{commugaugetrans}, \ref{{commugaugeoth} and \ref{{genegaugeg},   \ref{{genegaugeg5}, and commutation relations with  $i\gamma_5 \gamma_0\partial_\mu\gamma^\mu $ it can be shown \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{ferqgauge} [(1-\gamma_5) \not\! \partial, (1+\gamma_5) \not\! \partial b(x)]_- & = & 2[\not\! \partial, \not\! \partial b(x)]_- - 2\gamma_5[\not\! \partial,  \not\! \partial b(x) ]_+ \\ \label{{ferqgaugew} [(1-\gamma_5) \not\! \partial, (1+\gamma_5) b(x)  \not\! \partial ]_- & = & 2[\not\! \partial, b(x) \not\! \partial ]_- - 2\gamma_5[\not\! \partial, b(x)\not\! \partial ]_+  \\ \label{{ferqgaugex} [(1+\gamma_5) \not\! \partial, (1-\gamma_5) \not\! \partial b(x)]_- & = & 2[\not\! \partial, \not\! \partial b(x) ]_- + 2\gamma_5[\not\! \partial,  \not\! \partial b(x) ]_+  \\  \label{{ferqgaugez} [(1+\gamma_5) \not\! \partial, (1-\gamma_5) b(x) \not\! \partial ]_- & = & 2[\not\! \partial, b(x)  \not\! \partial ]_- + 2\gamma_5[\not\! \partial, b(x)\not\! \partial ]_+ . \end{{eqnarray}  The application of the symmetry  generator \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Gbs} \bar G^b=[\alpha_-(1+\gamma_5)+\alpha_+(1-\gamma_5)]G^b  \end{{eqnarray} on  eq. \ref{{Jaimeferqgauge}, where $G^a$ is given in eq. \ref{{genegaugeg}, produces the terms in  eqs. \ref{{ferqgauge}-\ref{{ferqgaugez} and cancels the anticommutator contributions. Therefore, we obtain  $\bar G^b$ will  be a generator of a gauge symmetry of eq. \ref{{Jaimeferqgauge}  in the sense explained before. In fact, in the  limit  $\alpha_+\rightarrow 0$ the symmetry is satisfied to first order since all other terms in  $e^{{i\bar G^b}$ cancel. Unlike the case of  eq. \ref{{Jaimeqmle},  we note only one gauge symmetry is allowed.     %We  investigate whether  eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq} has a gauge symmetry in the case % of arbitrary $\alpha_+$, $\alpha_-$ in %\begin{{eqnarray} %\label {{Jaimeferqgauge} %[ \alpha_+ \frac {{1}{{2}(1+\gamma_5) %+\alpha_- \frac {{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5) ]i \gamma_0\partial_\mu\gamma^\mu {{  \Psi}=0. %\end{{eqnarray} % The application of %the more general symmetry  generator %\begin{{eqnarray} %\label{{Gbs} %\bar G^b=[a_1(1+\gamma_5)+a_2(1-\gamma_5)]\not\!\partial b(x)+ %[a_3(1+\gamma_5)+a_4(1-\gamma_5)] {{b(x)\not\!\partial } % \end{{eqnarray} %on  eq. \ref{{Jaimeferqgauge} produces the first order self-explanatory terms % %\hspace{{-.5in} %\begin{{eqnarray} %\label{{ferqgauge}- %\alpha_+   (1-\gamma_5)  [  a_1 \not\!  \partial b(x)  \not\!  \partial + a_3 b(x)  \not\!  \partial ^2 ]- \nonumber  \\ %%& & \hspace{{-.5in}\gamma_5([\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_- -[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_+) \\ \label{{ferqgaugew} % \alpha_+ (1+\gamma_5) [a_2 %  \not\!\partial^2 b(x) +a_4 \not\!  \partial b(x)  \not\!  \partial]-\\  \nonumber % & = & % %[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_- -[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial ]_+ + \nonumber\\ %%& & \hspace{{-.5in}\gamma_5([\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_- -[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_+) \\ \label{{ferqgaugex} % \alpha_- (1-\gamma_5)[a_1 %   \not\!\partial^2 b(x)+a_3\not\!  \partial b(x)  \not\!  \partial]+\\ \nonumber % % & = &  % [\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_- +[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_+ -\nonumber\\ %%& & \hspace{{-.5in}\gamma_5([\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_- +[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_+)\\  \label{{ferqgaugez} %\alpha_- (1+\gamma_5) [a_2\not\!  \partial b(x)  \not\!  \partial + a_4 b(x)  \not\!  \partial ^2 ].   % & = & %% [\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_- +[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_+ + \nonumber\\ %%& & \hspace{{-.5in}\gamma_5([\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_- +[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_+) %\end{{eqnarray} % The demand that the non-scalar spin operators cancel implies the equations  %\hspace{{-.5in} %\begin{{eqnarray} %\label{{ferqgaugesum} %(\alpha_+a_1+\alpha_-a_2)[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_++(\alpha_-a_1+\alpha_+a_2)[ b(x)\not\! \partial , \not\! \partial]_++\nonumber \\ %\gamma_5[(-\alpha_+a_1+\alpha_-a_2)[\not\! \partial  b(x), \not\! \partial]_+ +(-\alpha_-a_1+\alpha_+a_2)[ b(x)\not\! \partial , \not\! \partial]_+]. %\end{{eqnarray}  %\hspace{{-.5in} %\begin{{eqnarray} %\label{{ferqgaugesum} %\alpha_+ (a_1-a_4)+ \alpha_-(- a_3+a_2)=0\ \ \ \ -\alpha_+ (a_1+a_4)+ \alpha_-( a_2+a_3)=0, %\end{{eqnarray} %with solutions $a_1=a_3(\alpha_+/\alpha_-)$, %$a_2=a_4(\alpha_-/\alpha_+)$. The additional demand that eq. %\ref{{ferqgauge} cancel in the sense of   eqs. %\ref{{commugaugetrans}, \ref{{commugaugeoth} leads to non-trivial %solutions only with   the condition $\alpha_-^2=a_+^2$. Therefore, we %can  conclude only that % $\bar G^b$ in eq. \ref{{Jaimeferqgauge} is  a possible generator of a   gauge symmetry of eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq}.  Unlike the case of % eq. \ref{{Jaimeqmle},  we note %only one gauge symmetry would be  allowed.  \section{{Currents and    vertex interaction  }    From Noether's theorem we have a conserved current for each continuous symmetry present in the system.  We  can construct, using eqs. \ref{{Jaimeq}, \ref{{Jaimeqdagger}, bilinear  current vector operators $j_\mu$, based on eq.  \ref{{field algebra},   and current vector expectation values    $tr(j_\mu)$, based on  eq. \ref{{pointproduct}, satisfying \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{currentacon} \partial^\mu j_\mu=0,\   \partial^\mu  tr(j_\mu)=0. \end{{eqnarray} The form of the $j_\mu$ is similar to the  currents in Dirac's equation,  given that some symmetries are shared by both Dirac equation and eqs. \ref{{Jaimeq}, \ref{{Jaimeqdagger}. In the case of eqs. \ref{{Jaimeq},  \ref{{Jaimeqmle}, and  \ref{{Jaimeferq} we also have the global symmetry  $\Psi\rightarrow e^{{ia}\Psi$, where $a$ is a  real parameter.  The corresponding  current operator  is \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{currenta}  j_\mu ={{ \Psi}^\dagger\gamma_0\gamma_\mu {{ \Psi}. \end{{eqnarray} This symmetry implies conservation of number of  particles, with  the zero component of the current being positive definite so that it can be interpreted as a probability density. This component has  already been  considered when setting a normalization condition  in eq. \ref{{normalization}.  The  symmetry  $\Psi\rightarrow e^{{ib\gamma_5}\Psi$, with $b$ real,  is valid for the massless equations \ref{{Jaimeqmle} and  \ref{{Jaimeferq} and leads to the chirality current \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{currentb} {{ j_\mu }^{{5}= {{ \Psi}^\dagger\gamma_5\gamma_0\gamma_\mu {{ \Psi}. \end{{eqnarray}  Expressions can be obtained also for the currents corresponding to the energy-momentum tensor and the generalized angular momentum  which are equal to those obtained for the Dirac equations. It is these which underlie the classification of the solutions with $H$ and ${{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}$. This partly justifies as well the classification done with the commutators of these operators  and the solutions, given that they are  also eigenfunctions under them.     The current operator corresponding to the gauge  symmetry in eq. \ref{{Jaimeferqgauge} (which overlaps with the above currents ${{ j_\mu }$, ${{ j_\mu }^{{5}$) is given by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{current} {{ j_\mu }^{{gau}=  {{ \Psi} ^{{\prime\dagger} \frac{{1}{{2} (1-\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\mu {{ \Psi} \end{{eqnarray} (we take here the bra ${{ \Psi} ^{{\prime\dagger} $  possibly distinct from the ket  ${{ \Psi} $). Comparison of the current ${{ j_\mu }^{{gau}$  with the form of the field \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Amusec}  A_{{\mu}^-   ({{k})= \frac{{i}{{2\sqrt{{2}}(1-\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\mu e^{{-i    kx} \end{{eqnarray} derived from the $\bfu_{{i}$ terms on Table  \ref{{VmA} strongly suggests a connection to the  transition matrix element  of the $A_{{\mu}^-$ operator field between the two massless fermion solutions  ${{ \Psi}^{{\prime}$ and ${{ \Psi}$ % Indeed, %generally defining the tensor %\begin{{eqnarray} %\label{{tensor} % \epsilon^{{\mu\nu}=g^{{\mu\nu} \epsilon_\nu \ \ \ {{\rm (no\ \  sum)} %\end{{eqnarray} %with $\epsilon_\nu$ containing  the spatial and polarization depedence, we may write generally write %\begin{{eqnarray} %\label{{Amusecgen} % A_{{5\mu}^-   ({{k})= \epsilon_ {{\mu }^{{\  \nu} \frac{{1}{{2} (1-\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\nu. %\end{{eqnarray} \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Amusecgentil}  \langle  {{ \Psi}^{{\prime}   |A_{{\mu}^-   ({{k})| {{ \Psi}\rangle. \end{{eqnarray} Indeed, in QFT   the minimal coupling ${{\mathcal{{L}}=g j_\mu^{{gau}A^{{-\mu}$ in the Lagrangian implies a vertex interaction which can lead to the  expectation value  of the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{vertex} g[\frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\mu]_{{\alpha \beta}\rightarrow g\langle u(p_f,s_f)|\frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\mu |u(p_i,s_i)\rangle, \end{{eqnarray} where $(p_{{i,f},s_{{i,f} )$ are the initial and final momenta and  spins  of the fermions,   $k_\mu$ is the momentum of the vector field, and $g$ is the coupling constant. A consistent interpretation of eqs. \ref{{current}-\ref{{Amusecgentil} is possible along these lines by understanding $\langle  {{ \Psi}^{{\prime}   |A_{{\mu}^-   ({{k})| {{ \Psi}\rangle$ as an interaction with its   assignment  to the vertex in eq. \ref{{vertex} and the coupling  constant $g=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}$.   (A more formal argument should take account of the exponential factor in eq. \ref{{Amusec} which can be done in the context of QFT; it would lead, together with the space-time dependence of the fermion wave functions to Dirac's delta $(2\pi)^4\delta^4(k_i-p_{{f}+p_{{i})$.  Also, the substitution $\ref{{vertex}$ is one of many ways to obtain a contribution in a perturbation expansion in terms of diagrams. Although $A_{{\mu}^-({{k})$ should be properly normalized as a field of units of $[energy]$ it is enough for our argument to keep the polarization normalized).  \section{{Lorentz $(3,1)$ Structure and Scalars  from $6$-$d$ Clifford Algebra}   In previous sections  we have derived a description of fermions and bosons through equations implied by the structure of the Clifford algebra in  $d=4$. Although the structure obtained is too simple to describe thoroughly aspects of the SM (for example, the model cannot include massive fermions) we have useful results which we would like to keep  as the prediction of interactions in the form of  vertices relating vectors and fermions, coupling constants, and in particular, hints of a description of isospin on left-handed particles. These features  are expected to remain in higher dimensions, where we find a more elaborate structure.  The simplest generalization of the above model is to consider the six-dimensional Clifford algebra, (the $d=5$ lives also in a $4\times 4$  space). This is composed of  64 $8\times 8$  matrices and it can be obtained as a tensor product of the original $4\times 4 $ algebra and the $2\times 2$ matrices generated by the unit matrix  $1_2$ and the three  Pauli matrices, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\sigma_3$.  We will use a basis for the $8\times 8$ matrix space in which we can  identify the underlying $d=4$ components  \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{generali} \gamma_0\rightarrow \gamma_0^\prime=1_2  \otimes {{\gamma_0},\ \gamma_1\rightarrow \gamma_1^\prime= 1_2\otimes  {{\gamma_1} ,\ \gamma_2\rightarrow \gamma_2^\prime= \sigma_1\otimes {{\gamma_2},\   \gamma_3\rightarrow \gamma_3^\prime=1_2 \otimes  {{\gamma_3}. \end{{eqnarray}Then   \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{scalars} 1_8,\  \sigma_1\otimes 1_4,\ \gamma_5^\prime  = \sigma_2\otimes \gamma_2,\ \gamma_6^\prime= \sigma_3\otimes \gamma_2 \end{{eqnarray}  are 4-$d$ scalars since they commute with the spin operators \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{sigmaprime}  \sigma_{{\mu\nu}^\prime=\frac{{i}{{2}[\gamma_\mu^\prime,\gamma_\nu^\prime] ,\   \mu=0,...,3,\    \nu=0,...,3. \end{{eqnarray} In fact, the  matrices $\gamma_\mu^\prime$ defined in eqs. \ref{{generali} and \ref{{scalars} form the $6$-$d$ Clifford algebra  \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Clifford}   \{{\gamma_\mu^\prime,\gamma_\nu^\prime\} =2 g_{{\mu\nu}. \end{{eqnarray}  As all $\gamma_\mu$ are generalized to $8\times 8$ matrices through a tensor product  $\gamma_\mu\rightarrow 1_2\otimes \gamma_\mu $, $ \mu=0,...,3,$ without danger of ambiguity we shall use  a notation in which we  now  assume that $\gamma_\mu$  represent $8\times 8$ matrices. We also use the quaternion-like notation  for the   representation of $1_2$ and the Pauli matrices in the $8\times 8$ matrix space  \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{quater} 1_8=1_2\otimes 1_4,\ I=\sigma_1\otimes 1_4,\   J= \sigma_2\otimes 1_4,\   K= \sigma_3\otimes1_4. \end{{eqnarray} The $4$-$d$ algebra will be written in terms of \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{sustitution}  \gamma_\mu^\prime=\gamma_\mu\ \ \mu=0,1,3\ \ \gamma_2^\prime=I \gamma_2, \end{{eqnarray} and the scalars in eq. \ref{{scalars} (here in Hermitian form) in terms of \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{sustitutionsca} 1=1_8,\ I,\ i\gamma_5^\prime=i J \gamma_2,\ i\gamma_6^\prime=i K \gamma_2.  \end{{eqnarray} Because  $I$, $J$, $K$ commute with  $\gamma_2$, it is possible to omit the tensor product sign. A more explicit form of these matrices can be found in the appendix. Then, all 64 elements of the $8\times 8$ algebra are obtained by  multiplying the 16 elements of  the 4-$d$ algebra  generated by  the terms in eqs. \ref{{sustitution} and \ref{{sustitutionsca}, and they can be written with this notation. Hence, it will be possible to identify every element constructed in this way in terms of  the 4-$d$ Lorentz representation it belongs to.  The preceding definitions will also be applied for the assignment $\gamma_5\rightarrow 1_2\otimes {{\gamma_5}\equiv \gamma_5 $. Then, besides the scalar elements of eq. \ref{{scalars} (or eq. \ref {{sustitutionsca}),  we have the scalars \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{scalarspseu} \gamma_5,\ I\gamma_5,\  J {{\gamma_2}\gamma_5,\   K {{\gamma_2}\gamma_5. \end{{eqnarray} From these, $I \gamma_5$ commutes with these  and the scalar elements in eq. \ref{{sustitutionsca}.  Excluding it and  the identity, the remaining six elements generate an $SO(4)$ algebra, or equivalently, an $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ algebra. The latter's generators consist of the right-handed elements \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{SU2r} \frac{{1}{{4}(1+I \gamma_5)I,\ \frac{{i}{{4}(1+I \gamma_5)J {{\gamma_2},\ \frac{{i}{{4}(1+I \gamma_5)K {{\gamma_2}, \end{{eqnarray} and left-handed elements \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{SU2} I_1&=& \frac{{i}{{4}(1-I \gamma_5)J {{\gamma_2}\\  I_2&=&-\frac{{i}{{4}(1-I \gamma_5)K {{\gamma_2}\\ I_3&=&-\frac{{1}{{4}(1-I \gamma_5)I \label{{Iso3}. \end{{eqnarray} The eight  form an $SU(2)_R\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)\times U(1)$, where the subscripts $L$ and $R$  are added accordingly  (the normalization is chosen to fit $\frac{{1}{{2}\sigma_i$).     \noindent{{ \bf Chain breaking of $d=6$ Algebra}  The above symmetry operators immediately  show a close    connection to the actual symmetries observed in nature at the massless level, that is,  the $SU(2)_L$ of isospin and  $U(1)_Y$ of hypercharge groups. The eight scalars in eqs. \ref{{sustitutionsca} and \ref{{scalarspseu}, have a Cartan algebra of dimension four, for which we can take the basis $1$, $I$, $\gamma_5$, $I\gamma_5$.    %CORREGIR These operators can be arranged into the four projection operators \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{proje} P_{{++} &=&\frac{{1}{{4} (1+I \gamma_5)   (1+I)\\ P_{{+-}&=&\frac{{1}{{4} (1+I \gamma_5)   (1-I)\\ P_{{-+}&=&\frac{{1}{{4} (1-I \gamma_5)   (1+I)\\ P_{{--}&=&\frac{{1}{{4} (1-I \gamma_5)   (1-I) \end{{eqnarray} which, when combined with the Dirac operator, create the general massless Lorentz-invariant equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{geneq} (\alpha_{{++}P_{{++} +\alpha_{{+-}P_{{+-} +\alpha_{{-+}P_{{-+} +\alpha_{{--}P_{{--} ) \gamma_0( i \partial^\mu{{\gamma_\mu^\prime} ) \Psi=0 \ \mu=0,...,3. \end{{eqnarray}  We then have four different Lorentz-invariant degrees of freedom $\alpha_{{++}$, $\alpha_{{+-}$, $\alpha_{{-+}$, $\alpha_{{--}$,  for constructing a generalized equation. One or various vanishing coefficients lead to degrees of freedom disappearing from the spectrum. In fact, the choice  of non-vanishing  coefficients  divides this equation into four classes. For each class we assume that all fields transform under the same Lorentz representation. Additional conditions on the coefficients might lead to more symmetries to appear. The different choices are as follows:    In class I, only one coefficient is non-vanishing, e.g. %FIGURE  $\alpha_{{-+}\not=0$,  and $\alpha_{{++}=\alpha_{{+-}=\alpha_{{--}=0$  (we will not consider the  different  four permutations of the $\alpha_{{ij}$ belonging to this class and others, which have similar properties). Without loss of generality here and in similar cases, we may assume $\alpha_{{-+}=1$.   %CHECK Here for the fact that the flavors are beyond $SU(2)$, etc  This type of equation is similar to eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq}, except that in this case, in addition to the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry generated by $P_{{-+}$,  we have a flavor $SU(6)$, whose elements are projected by $P_{{+-}+P_{{-+}+P_{{--}$. %and the 4-$d$ Clifford algebra by the %four $\gamma_\mu^\prime$. %QUOTE? %(in all cases the right or left Casimir  is proportional to the $U(1)_L$ or %$U(1)_R$ respectively)WHAT?   In class II, in which two $\alpha_{{ij}$ vanish,  we have in general at least a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and a $SU(4)$ flavor symmetry. Furthermore, we consider three   possibilities for choices of the $\alpha_{{ij}$. In the  case $\alpha_{{-+}=\alpha_{{--}\not=0$ we have in particular a $U(1)_L\times SU(2)_L$ gauge symmetry. In this case, both fermions and vectors are obtained in the spectrum, but the fermions are all left-handed  as for solutions  on Table \ref{{fermionsend}, and their antiparticles right-handed. The cases  $\alpha_{{++}\not=0$, $\alpha_{{-+}\not=0$, or $\alpha_{{++}\not=0$, $\alpha_{{--}\not=0$  resemble eq. \ref{{Jaimeferqgauge} and break any possible gauge $SU(2)$ symmetry.  For class III, where only one $\alpha_{{ij}=0$,  we have in general  an $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry, and three gauge  $U(1)$s. In the case, $\alpha_{{-+}=\alpha_{{--}$ instead of one $U(1)$ we have also  a gauge $SU(2)_L$ symmetry; by setting e.g. $\alpha_{{-+}=\alpha_{{+-}$ or  $\alpha_{{--}=\alpha_{{+-}$ we get an equation which has a projection of the form of eq. \ref{{Jaimeqmle}, that is, with parity as a  symmetry, a condition  necessary to have a solution of the form of an electromagnetic field. The representations contain both vectors and fermions which are  both left-handed and right-handed.   Finally, for class IV, in the case $\alpha_{{++}=\alpha_{{+-}=\alpha_{{--}=\alpha_{{-+}$    we have a gauge $U(2)_L \times  U(2)_R$ and the representations only contain vectors of the type appearing on Tables  \ref{{VmA}, \ref{{VpA} %CHECK and \ref{{eigenantis}, \ref{{eigsend}. There is a possibility of finding a similar description to that of class III if we use a Lorentz transformation projected with $L=P_{{+-}+P_{{-+}+P_{{--}$. This case will not be considered.  From the four choices described it is type III (or type IV under the condition stated) with  $\alpha_{{-+}=\alpha_{{--}=\alpha_{{+-}$  which can be parity conserving and which  contains an $SU(2)_L$ symmetry. We shall associate this group with the  isospin and one  $U(1)$ with  the hypercharge. This case  is  analyzed in detail in the following section.    \section{{Massless case: Type III spectrum, Unified $SU(2)\times U(1)$ }   We analyze  the equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{geneqIII} i L\gamma_0  \partial^\mu\gamma_\mu^\prime \Psi=0,\ \mu=0,...,3, \end{{eqnarray} where we use the projection operator \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{OpeYLor2N} L=P_{{+-} +P_{{-+} +P_{{--} =\frac{{3}{{4}-\frac{{1}{{4}(I+\gamma_5+I \gamma_5 ), \end{{eqnarray} which corresponds to the type III case with $\alpha_{{+-}=\alpha_{{-+}=\alpha_{{--}$. The equation is invariant under the set of Lorentz transformations \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{angularL} J_{{\mu\nu}^L=L[i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu)+\frac{{1}{{2}\sigma_{{\mu\nu}^\prime] , \end{{eqnarray} where $\sigma_{{\mu\nu}^\prime $ is defined in eq. \ref{{sigmaprime}. The scalar symmetries are classified into flavor, with its generators  projected by $P_{{++}$,  an $SU(2)_L$   gauge symmetry, and  two other $U(1)$ gauge, according to the arguments following  eq. \ref{{Jaimeferqgauge}. We choose one generator of $SU(2)_L$ to classify the solutions, say, $I_3$ in eq. \ref{{Iso3}, with eigenvalue $I_{{s3}$. The other two $U(1)$ gauge generators, are chosen orthogonal to $I_3$ and will be taken \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{hyperch} Y=-1+\frac{{1}{{2}(I+\gamma_5)% this minus is to make accord with eigenvalues... REMEMBER TO CHANGE Q SIGN \end{{eqnarray} and $\tilde \gamma_5=L\gamma_5 $. $\tilde \gamma_5$ is orthogonal to $Y$ and $I_3$ in the sense of $tr(\tilde \gamma_5 Y)=0$, and $tr(\tilde \gamma_5 I_3)=0$. The choice in eq. \ref{{hyperch} can be obtained from the demand  that the operator lead to a gauge symmetry in the sense of eq. \ref{{Gbs}. Another justification  for these definitions will be given  later. Although we  call it gauge we still need to prove that a chiral symmetry as the $I_i$ actually is but we shall make this assumption. There are also global symmetries which are related to particle number conservation. $L$ is interpreted as the lepton number, whose quantum number we denote by  $l$. The  Casimir of $SU(2)_L$ $I_1^2+I_2^2+I_3^2$, with eigenvalue $I_s(I_s+1)$, is not an independent component, but a linear combination of $\tilde \gamma_5$, and $Y$.  We present the  fermion and boson solutions of eq. \ref{{geneqIII}  which we classify according to the  Hamiltonian and helicity projections, $L \gamma_0\gamma^3$, $ \frac{{i}{{2} L I \gamma_1\gamma_2$, the generator  $I_{{3}$, and the quantum numbers, $Y$, $I_s$. We also define the flavor as $f_{{30}=\frac{{1}{{2}(1-L)\gamma_3 \gamma_0$ and its eigenvalue $f$.  {{\bf Spin 1/2 particles}   The $l=1$, $I_s=1/2$, $Y=-1$  massless fermions are given on Table \ref{{doubletend}, \begin{{table} \begin{{eqnarray} \nonumber Left-handed\ massless\  spin\ 1/2\ particles,\ f=1/2 &L\gamma_0\gamma^3  & \frac{{i}{{2}  L I\gamma _1 \gamma _2\ \ \ \  I_{{3} \\ \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \nu_{{-1/2} (k) \\ \nonumber l^-_{{-1/2}(k)  \end{{array} \right )_L = \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \frac{{1}{{8} (1-I\gamma _5  ) ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2)   (\gamma_0+ \gamma_3) \\ \nonumber \frac{{1}{{8} (1-I \gamma _5 )  ( 1+I)   (\gamma_0+ \gamma_3)  \end{{array} \right ) & 1 & -1/2 \begin{{array}{{c}  1/2 \\ -1/2 \end{{array} \\ \left( \begin{{array}{{c} \nu_{{-1/2} (\tilde k)  \\ l^-_{{-1/2} (\tilde k)  \end{{array} \right )_L = \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \frac{{1}{{8} (1-I\gamma _5 ) ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2) (\gamma_1+i I \gamma_2)  \\ \nonumber \frac{{1}{{8} (1-I\gamma _5 ) ( 1+I) (\gamma_1+i I \gamma_2) \end{{array} \right ) & -1 & 1/2 \begin{{array}{{c} 1/2 \\ -1/2   \end{{array} \\ \nonumber  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%"negative" energy terms %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Left-handed\ massless\  spin\ 1/2\ particles,\ f=-1/2 &   L\gamma_0\gamma^3    & \frac{{i}{{2}  L I\gamma _1 \gamma _2\ \ \ \  I_{{3} \\ \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \hat\nu_{{-1/2} (k)   \\ \nonumber \hat l^-_{{-1/2}  (k)  \end{{array}\right )_L = \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \frac{{1}{{8} (1-I\gamma _5 )  ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2) (\gamma_1- iI \gamma_2) \\ \nonumber \frac{{1}{{8} (1-I \gamma _5 )  ( 1+I)  (\gamma_1- iI \gamma_2 )  \end{{array} \right ) & 1 & -1/2 \begin{{array}{{c}  1/2 \\ -1/2 \end{{array} \\ \nonumber \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \hat{{\nu}_{{-1/2}(\tilde k)   \\ \nonumber \hat l^-_{{-1/2} (\tilde k)  \end{{array}\right )_L = \left( \begin{{array}{{c} \frac{{1}{{8}  (1-I\gamma _5 ) ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2) (\gamma_0- \gamma_3)   \\ \nonumber \frac{{1}{{8} (1-I \gamma _5 )  ( 1+I) (\gamma_0- \gamma_3)  \end{{array} \right ) & -1 & 1/2 \begin{{array}{{c}  1/2 \\ -1/2  \end{{array}  \end{{eqnarray}  \caption{{$l=1$, $I_s=1/2$, $Y=-1$  massless fermion multiplets in 5+1 $d$.\label{{doubletend}} \end{{table} where the  subscript  $- 1/2$ refers  to the value of the helicity operator $[{{\bf \Sigma\cdot\hat{{\bf  p}},\ ]$, so that we also present particles with opposite momentum, and the index $L$ denotes (in a redundant way) the left-handed character of the solutions. The space-time dependence of these solutions can be obtained also following eq. \ref{{coordepw}. Negative energy solutions are obtained by changing the sign of the exponential  and the hermitian conjugates of the latter are the antiparticle solutions.   These spin 1/2 particles belong to the fundamental representation of the non-abelian group $SU(2)_L$ and  are labeled also by the $Y$ operator. In consideration of the quantum numbers of leptons in nature, it follows we can associate  $Y$ with the hypercharge and  the $I_i$ with the three generators of isospin. We also associate the two elements distinguished only by the $f$ quantum number (and a hat) with a  flavor doublet which we identify with  any two lepton families among the three generations, e. g., the left-handed electron and muon and their neutrinos.   Another part of the spectrum has positive chirality, $l=1$, $I_s=0$, $Y=-2$ and  is given on Table \ref{{singletend}, \begin{{table} \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{singlet}\nonumber \ Right-handed\ massless\  spin\ 1/2\ particles & L\gamma_0\gamma^3  & \frac{{i}{{2}L I\gamma _1 \gamma _2\ \ [f_{{30},\ ] \\ \nonumber  l^-_{{1/2R}(k)= \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5 ) ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2) \gamma_0 (\gamma_1+ i I \gamma_2)   & 1 &  1/2 \ \      1/2 \\ \nonumber l^-_{{1/2R} (\tilde k)=   \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I\gamma _5 ) ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2) \gamma_0 (\gamma_0+\gamma_3) & -1 & -1/2 \ \  1/2 \\ \nonumber   \hat l^-_{{1/2R}(  k) =\frac{{1}{{8}  (1+I\gamma _5 )  ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2) \gamma_0 (\gamma_0-\gamma_3) & 1 &   1/2     \ -1/2 \\ \nonumber  \hat l^-_{{1/2R} (\tilde k)= \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I\gamma _5 )  ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2) \gamma_0 (\gamma_1- i I\gamma_2) & -1 &  -1/2  \ \   -1/2 \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{$l=1$, $I_s=0$, $Y=-2$  massless fermion multiplets in 5+1 $d$.  \label{{singletend}} \end{{table} where    antiparticles can be obtained with the corresponding transformations, and as in previous cases, the solutions presented can be obtained from each other by a rotation.  The quantum numbers correspond to  right-handed charged leptons, as we will show, again in good correspondence with the SM. %DEFINE l^-, etc.  \noindent{{\bf Vectors}  The pure vector solutions are similar to the $\bfu_i$, $\bfut_i$ terms in  Tables  \ref{{VmA}, \ref{{VpA}. The isospin scalars can be separated into their $V$+$A$ and $V$-$A$ components (all have lepton number $l=0$, as required). The first are given on Table \ref{{righthandZend}. \begin{{table}[h] \begin{{eqnarray}  \nonumber Vector \ solutions &  [H/k_0,\ ] & [{{\bf \Sigma\cdot\hat{{\bf  p}},\ ] \\ \nonumber \tilde B_{{1}(k)  = \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma_5)(1-I )  \gamma_0(\gamma_1+i I \gamma_2) & 2 & 1 \\ \nonumber \tilde B_{{1}(\tilde k)=\frac{{1}{{8}  (1+I \gamma_5)(1-I ) \gamma_0  (\gamma_1-i I \gamma_2)&  2 &  1 \\ \nonumber \tilde B_{{0}(k)=\frac{{1}{{8}   (1+I \gamma_5)(1-I )  \gamma_0(\gamma_0-\gamma_3) & 0 & 0 \\ \nonumber %THIS ONE HAS DIRAC EIGENVALUE 1 \tilde B_{{0}(\tilde k) = \frac{{1}{{8}   (1+I \gamma_5)(1-I ) \gamma_0(\gamma_0+\gamma_3) & 0 & 0    %THIS ONE HAS DIRAC EIGENVALUE -1 \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{$I_s=0$, $Y=0$, $V$+$A$  vectors  in 5+1 $d$. \label{{righthandZend}}. \end{{table}  Comparing these solutions with those on Table  \ref{{VpA}, we see they differ by the substitution \ref{{sustitution} and the projector $P_{{+-}$. Similarly, the $V$-$A$ terms can be obtained straightforwardly from Table  \ref{{VmA} and the projector $P_{{-+}+ P_{{--}$.  These are given on Table \ref{{BLend}. \begin{{table} \begin{{eqnarray}  \nonumber Vector \ solutions &  [H/k_0,\ ]  & [{{\bf \Sigma\cdot\hat{{\bf  p}},\ ] \\ \nonumber \label{{BLbegin} B_{{-1}(k)= \frac{{1}{{4\sqrt{{2} } (1-I \gamma_5) \gamma_0(\gamma_1-i I \gamma_2) & 2 & -1 \\ \nonumber B_{{-1}(\tilde k) =  \frac{{1}{{4\sqrt{{2} } (1-I \gamma_5) \gamma_0(\gamma_1+i I \gamma_2) & 2 & -1 \\ \nonumber B_{{0}(k)=  \frac{{1}{{4\sqrt{{2} } (1-I \gamma_5) \gamma_0(\gamma_0-  \gamma_3) & 0 & 0 \\ \nonumber B_{{0}(\tilde k) = \frac{{1}{{4\sqrt{{2} } (1-I \gamma_5) \gamma_0(\gamma_0+  \gamma_3)  & 0 & 0 \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{$I_s=0$, $Y=0$, $V$-$A$  vectors in 5+1 $d$. \label{{BLend}} \end{{table}  Taking account of the normalization, a combination of the terms $B_{{i}$  and $\tilde B_{{i}$      can be taken which carries the  hypercharge $Y$ in eq. \ref{{hyperch}. %SAY SOMETHING OF HYPECHARGE CURRENT AS %the same vector space as %EXPLAIN MORE, or maybe before, when discussing currents %the hypercharge current. ?

Three additional sets of solutions of the equation can be described in terms of the fields $B_{{i}$ on Table \ref{{BLend} and the generators of  $SU(2)_L$ in eqs. \ref{{SU2}-\ref{{Iso3}, which are  written  in a spherical  basis on Table \ref{{chm}. \begin{{table}[h] \begin{{eqnarray} \nonumber Isospin\ vector\ carriers & & I_{{3}  \\ \nonumber W^+_i(k) =&\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}(J \gamma_2-i K \gamma_2)  B_{{i}(k) &1 \label{{chp} \\ \nonumber W^0_i(k) =& I B_{{i}(k)  &0 \\ \nonumber W^-_i(k) =&\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}( J\gamma_2+i K\gamma_2)B_{{i}(k) &-1 \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{Isospin triplet   vector bosons  in 5+1 $d$. \label{{chm}} \end{{table} %With this phase definition we have  $W^+_i=-{{(W^-_i)}^\dagger$ (AS SUCH THIS IS NOT %CORRECT.

As these $V$-$A$ vector  solutions belong to the  adjoint representation of group $SU(2)_L$, $I_s=1$, we associate them with the fields $W_\mu^\pm$, $W_\mu^0$ of the electroweak theory.  \noindent{{\bf Scalars and antisymmetric tensors}  The last part of the boson spectrum is composed of scalar and antisymmetric $Y=-1$ doublets (and antiparticles). The solutions are constructed similarly to the $\bfwt_i$  components on Table \ref{{eigsend} with  the addition of the factors containing $I$, $ J \gamma_2$,  $ K \gamma_2$, which account for the hypercharge  and isospin quantum numbers. The  corresponding $Y=-1$  doublets  are given on Table \ref{{nsend}. \begin{{table} \begin{{eqnarray} \nonumber Scalars\ and\ antisymmetric\ tensors\ & [H/k_0,\ ]   & [{{\bf \Sigma\cdot}\hat{{\bf  p},\ ]\ \ I_{{3} \\ \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \tilde n_0(k)\\ \nonumber \tilde v_0(k)  \end{{array}\right )= \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5) (J \gamma_2- i K \gamma_2)  ( \gamma_0 +\gamma _3)\\  \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5) ( 1-I )  ( \gamma_0 +\gamma _3) \end{{array} \right ) &2&0 \ \begin{{array}{{c} 1/2    \\ \nonumber -1/2  \end{{array}  \\ \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \tilde n_{{0}(\tilde k)  \\ \nonumber \tilde v_{{0}(\tilde k)  \end{{array}\right )= \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \frac{{1}{{8}  (1+I \gamma _5) (J \gamma_2- i K \gamma_2)  ( \gamma_0 -\gamma _3)\\ \nonumber  \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5) ( 1-I )  ( \gamma_0 -\gamma _3)  \end{{array}\right ) &2&0 \ \begin{{array}{{c} 1/2    \\ -1/2  \end{{array}     \\ \nonumber \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \tilde n_{{ 1}(k)  \\ \nonumber \tilde v_{{ 1}(k)  \end{{array}\right )= \left( \begin{{array}{{c}   \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5) ( J \gamma_2- i K\gamma_2)  ( \gamma_1 +i I\gamma _2)\\ \nonumber  \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5)( 1-I )  ( \gamma_1 +iI\gamma _2)  \end{{array}\right )&0& 1  \ \begin{{array}{{c} 1/2    \\ -1/2  \end{{array}      \\ \nonumber \left( \begin{{array}{{c} \tilde  n_{{ 1}(\tilde k)  \\ \nonumber \tilde v_{{ 1}(\tilde k)  \end{{array}\right )= \left( \begin{{array}{{c}  \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5)  ( J \gamma_2- i K \gamma_2)  ( \gamma_1 -i I \gamma _2)\\ \nonumber  \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5)  ( 1-I )  ( \gamma_1 -i I \gamma _2)\end{{array}\right )&0& 1  \ \begin{{array}{{c} 1/2    \\ -1/2  \end{{array} \end{{eqnarray} \caption{{$I_s=1/2$, $Y=-1$, boson chiral terms  in 5+1 $d$. \label{{nsend}} \end{{table} The same problems arise regarding   the  Lorentz interpretation of antisymmetric terms as for  Tables \ref{{eigenantis}, \ref{{eigsend}. The same procedure in extracting from these solutions  vector and scalar components can be used.  Again here there is a parallelism with the SM. A scalar particle appears in a doublet and we will see it is involved in giving  masses to the particles. For this reason, we may associate this degree of freedom with the Higgs particle. We   leave open the question of whether these mass terms can be obtained from a gauge transformation, although the form of the proposed gauge transformation here suggests it should be possible.  Summarizing,  the positive energy solutions are   the vectors $B_i$ and $\tilde B_i$ which amount to eight degrees of freedom, where we are taking  account of both directions of momenta for given helicity. The isospin vectors $W_i^{{\pm,0}$  have twelve degrees of freedom and the antisymmetric tensors and scalars $\tilde n_i$ and $\tilde v_i$ eight, and with their antiparticles sixteen. These add up to thirty-six bosons. We have obtained massless spin 1/2 particles in a doublet and a singlet; these use four and two degrees of freedom respectively. Taking account of antiparticles and the two flavors we have twenty-four fermion degrees of freedom.  Altogether, these add up to sixty degrees of freedom. The reason for not having sixty-four active is the four inert degrees of freedom projected by $P_{{++}$, which are not influenced by  the Hamiltonian, projected by $L$.    %COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT IT APPEARS AS IF THE SYMMETRY WAS BROKEN  \section{{Massive case: Symmetry breaking of $SU(2)\times U(1)$ }   In seeking a  massive extension of eq. \ref{{geneqIII} we expect all the hermitian combinations of the  scalar terms  in eqs. \ref{{sustitutionsca}   and \ref{{scalarspseu}, multiplied by $\gamma_0$ (in a Hamiltonian form of the equation),  to be scalars with respect to the Lorentz transformation  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{angularpri} J_{{\mu\nu}^\prime= i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu)+\frac{{1}{{2}\sigma_{{\mu\nu}^\prime, \end{{eqnarray} which just generalizes eq. \ref{{angular}. However, if we also demand that they be scalars  with respect to $ J_{{\mu\nu}^L$ in eq. \ref{{angularL}, then the choices are reduced to \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{massterms} M_1&=&\frac{{M}{{2}(1-I), \\  M_2&=& \frac{{i M}{{2}(\gamma_5-I \gamma_5),\\  M_3&=& -\frac{{M}{{2}J\gamma_2  (1+\gamma_5), \label{{M3} \\ M_4&=& \frac{{M}{{2} K\gamma_2  (1+\gamma_5), \label{{masstermsend} \end{{eqnarray} where $M$ is the mass constant. Now, the only non-trivial scalar that commutes with   all  $M_i$ terms is $L$. Nevertheless, if we relax this condition we obtain in addition that precisely and only \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{charge} Q=I_3+\frac{{1}{{2} Y \end{{eqnarray} commutes with $M_3$ and $M_4$ ($Q^\prime=I_3-\frac{{1}{{2} Y$ commutes with $M_1$ and $M_2$). As $Q$ is the electric charge we deduce the electromagnetic $U(1)_{{em}$ remains a symmetry while the hypercharge and isospin  are broken. We stress that   $Q$ is deduced, rather than being imposed, as the only  additional symmetry consistent with massive terms. $M_3$ and $M_4$ do not commute among themselves, but rather, can be obtained from each other through a  unitary transformation involving $\gamma_5$. We therefore choose one, $M_3$,  to study the massive representations. We will show the  equation %PUT NOTATION WHERE ALSO   $\gamma_0$ APPEARS in M_4 ? \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{eqIIImass} (L\gamma_0 i \partial^\mu\gamma_\mu^\prime  - M_3\gamma_0){{  \Psi}=0\ \  \mu=0,...,3, \end{{eqnarray} %check that all "\gamma_5 I" I \gamma_5 have the same order gives rise to massive and massless fermions and vectors that are contained  in the SM, at symmetry breaking.  \noindent{{\bf Vectors}  Despite the presence of a massive term  we get a set of vector components which remain massless, as their product with the mass term $M_3$ (or $M_4$)  in eq. \ref{{eqIIImass} vanishes. These are the combination of the  massless and chargeless terms on Tables \ref{{BLend} and \ref{{chm} \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{photon} A_{{Li}=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}(B_{{i}-W_i^0). %CHECK NORMALIZATION \end{{eqnarray}   There are several parity operators for eq. \ref{{eqIIImass} with the necessary properties.  They differ by the square which leads to different projection operator combinations. The only one leading to non-trivial solutions  acts on the  same space as  $Q$ and is of the same rank.  This is \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{parity} P=M_3\gamma_0 \wp, \end{{eqnarray} where $\wp$ is defined as for eq. \ref{{P} and $M_3$ is given in eq. \ref{{M3}.   The remaining bosons  become massive. The massive chargeless solutions are a combination of the  vectors $B_{{ i}$, $\tilde B_{{ i}$  on Tables \ref{{righthandZend}, \ref{{BLend}, the $W_{{i}^0$ on Table \ref{{chm}, the $\tilde n_i$ bosons on  Table \ref{{nsend}, and their antiparticles $n_i$, with  $n_{{0}(k)=\tilde n_{{0}^\dagger(\tilde k)$, $n_{{0}(\tilde k)=\tilde n_{{0}^\dagger(k)$, $n_{{-1}( k)=-\tilde n_{{1}^\dagger( k)$, $n_{{-1}(\tilde k)=-\tilde n_{{1}^\dagger(\tilde k)$. We construct the latter using Table \ref{{eigenantis} and multiplying on the left by operators carrying the isospin and hypercharge, with phases as on Table \ref{{nsend}. The solutions   can be classified in  two groups, depending on the value of the commutator $ [ M_3 \gamma_0,{{ \Psi}]$, or equivalently, by the value of the operator $P$.

The terms found, $A_{{Li}$ in eq. \ref{{photon},  and $P_i$, $\bar P_i$, $Q_i$, $\bar Q_i$ on Tables \ref{{vectormassend}, \ref{{vectormassMasse}, sum twenty degrees of freedom. Similar combinations as for the massive vector terms $U_{{i}$, $\bar U_{{i}$, $V_{{i}$, $\bar V_{{i}$ on Tables \ref{{massivesol}, \ref{{massivesolPmend} can be taken to obtain terms with the necessary transformation properties.  %The most straightforward assignment we can make is to relate %the  massless chargeless vector $A_{{Li}$  in  eq. \ref{{photon} to the photon. %However, these terms describe only one type of chirality. The %other chirality is contained in the massive terms in eq. \ref{{vectormass}. %As we the $U(1)_Q$ gauge symmetry remains valid %even in the massive case, we expect these degrees of freedom to %remain massless, although it appears this can only be achieved by taking %a complete series of diagrams.  %With the caveat that these terms do not %necessarily represent solutions to eq. \ref{{eqIIImass}, %the vector components of the photon are obtained by extending %the solutions  $A_{{Li}$=\, to an  odd parity %vector field.  %CORRECT THIS  %Without expecting that solutions be eigenvalues of the mass term we construct a %massless solution  by considering only the kinetic term in eq. \ref{{geneqIII}. This equation %is parity invariant, a symmetry satisfied by the electromagnetic field.  The (normalized) vector components solutions of Tables \ref{{vectormassend}, \ref{{vectormassMasse}, which transform as a non-axial vector by $P$ in eq. \ref{{parity} are given by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{photoncompl} A_\mu=\frac{{1}{{2}Q\gamma_0\gamma_\mu. \end{{eqnarray} $A_\mu$  can be represented as a mixture of two chargeless  and massless  components.  On  the one hand,   Tables \ref{{vectormassend}, \ref{{vectormassMasse} contain the  special combination, of the $B_{{i}$ on Table \ref{{righthandZend},  and the $\tilde B_{{i}$ on Table \ref{{BLend}, which form precisely \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Zcompl} B_\mu=\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{3}}Y \gamma_0\gamma_\mu, \end{{eqnarray}  that is, the hypercharge carriers.  This gives   another  justification for the choice of $Y$ given in eq. \ref {{hyperch},   which is the operator giving the correct values for the hypercharge of fermions. Thus we obtain another  argument  needed to set $Y$ whose background is  in   the way we arrive at the expression for $Q$ in eq. \ref{{charge}. %We note that in this field the twoto %different quantum numbers which characterize the interaction with % the different chiral fermion components %imply different occupation probabilities for the two field helicities. %CHECK WHETHER % A  VECTOR HELICITY IS REALLY RELATED TO FERMION HELICITY. On the other hand, we can extract the chargeless vector components for the isospin triplet from Table \ref{{chm} \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Wcompl} W_\mu^0=  I_3\gamma_0\gamma_\mu, %CHECK NOTATION \end{{eqnarray} where $I_3$ is given in eq. \ref{{Iso3}.  From the expression for $Q$ and eqs. \ref{{photoncompl}, \ref{{Zcompl}, and  \ref{{Wcompl} we easily obtain \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Weinangle} A_\mu=\frac{{1}{{2}W_\mu^0+\frac{{\sqrt{{3}}{{2}B_\mu. \end{{eqnarray} The value of Weinberg's angle $\theta_W$  is derived  immediately from this equation by making an analogy with the new fields obtained in the  SM, after application of the Higgs mechanism. The photon then has the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{photonSM} A_\mu=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{ {{g^\prime}^2+g^2}}(gB_\mu+g^\prime W^0_\mu),\end{{eqnarray} where $g$ and $g^\prime$ are respectively the isospin and hypercharge coupling constants. We obtain  $\frac{{g^\prime}{{g} =\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{3}}$. As in the SM $tan(\theta_W)=\frac{{g^\prime}{{g}$ we find  \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{sinWeinangle} sin^2(\theta_W)=.25 \end{{eqnarray}  The $Z_\mu$ field can be constructed by considering the orthogonal combination to $A_\mu$ in eq. \ref{{Weinangle} \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{MassZ} Z_\mu=\frac{{\sqrt{{3}}{{2}W_\mu^0-\frac{{1}{{2}B_\mu. \end{{eqnarray}  We therefore find the $A_\mu$ and $Z_\mu$ span the vector components on Tables \ref{{vectormassend}, \ref{{vectormassMasse}.   The charged massive solutions can be related to the $W^\pm_\mu$ components in the SM. Although we obtained a difference in the masses  of the $Z_\mu$ and $W_\mu^\pm$ this is not the corresponding to the one obtained in the SM. Also, the vector particle $A_\mu$ is massive.  We attribute these differences to the fact that term  $M_3\gamma_0$  does not commute with the kinetic term in eq. \ref{{geneqIII} which is required to allow for simultaneously massive and massless solutions in the space projected by $Q$. Indeed, the space spanned by the vectors $A_{{Li}$ in eq. \ref{{photon} is annihilated by $M_3$. This fact allows them to be  massless solutions.     \noindent{{\bf Coupling constants: Vector fermion-current vertices}   Following the steps which allow for  a  vertex interpretation of   eq. \ref {{Amusecgentil}  it is possible to derive the vertices  describing the coupling of the fermions to the vectors obtained from the solutions.  This information  can be summarized through the  Lagrangian density \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Lagrangian} {{\mathcal{{L}}=\frac{{g}{{2\sqrt{{2}}[\nu^\dagger(1-I \gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma^\mu    u  W^+_\mu +hc]-\\ \nonumber \frac{{e}{{2} [tan(\theta_W)(2l_R^\dagger\gamma_0\gamma^\mu l_R+\nu^\dagger\gamma_0\gamma^\mu\nu+l_L^\dagger \gamma_0\gamma^\mu l_L)+\\ \nonumber cot(\theta_W)(\nu^\dagger\gamma_0\gamma^\mu\nu-l_L^\dagger \gamma_0\gamma^\mu l_L)]Z_\mu- e u^\dagger \gamma_0\gamma^\mu uA_\mu,  \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} where $\nu$, $l_L$ are given on Table \ref{{doubletend},  $l_R$ are given on Table   \ref{{singletend} and $u$ are given on Table \ref{{eleMassend}. The electric charge is given by $e=gg^\prime/{{\sqrt{{{{g^\prime}^2+g^2}}$.    In addition,  the vertices  give information on the coupling constants  $g^\prime$ and $g$, which cannot be extracted from eqs. as \ref{{Weinangle} or \ref{{MassZ}. Information on these can be obtained by calculating the overlap of the vectors with the corresponding fermion currents, which are given explicitly in eq. \ref{{Lagrangian}. This can be done more realistically  by considering the $7+1$ dimensional Clifford algebra where vector massless solutions become possible. The coupling constant $g$ can be obtained from the coupling of   the massive charged vectors  $W_{{M\mu}^+$ in eq.  \ref{{WsMass}  and the charged current, obtained from the neutrino and charged massive lepton wave functions, represented by the first term of eq. \ref{{Lagrangian}. It is \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{g} g=1/\sqrt{{2}\approx .707\ . \end{{eqnarray}  %CHECK if HIGGS Terms don't overpredict. (THEY Mix left-handed and right %handed terms as mass terms). The coupling $g^\prime$ is deduced from the second term in eq. \ref{{Lagrangian} to be \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{gprime} g^\prime=1/\sqrt{{6}\approx .408\  . \end{{eqnarray} It is a consistency feature of the theory that these values agree with Weinberg's angle in  eq. \ref{{sinWeinangle}. (At 5+1 dimensions the also consistent  values $g=1$, $g^\prime=1/\sqrt{{3}\approx .577$ are obtained).  In addition, these values are to be compared with the experimentally measured ones at energies  of the mass  of the $W$ particle, which is where the breakdown of the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry occurs. These are $g_{{exp}^\prime\approx .35$, $g_{{exp}\approx .65$, and $sin^2(\theta_{{Wexp})\approx .23$\ .              \section{{Summary   and conclusions} In this work  we have  departed from a generalized  Dirac equation whose solutions, with  the rules we have postulated to interpret them, exhibit some similarity to    quantum fields.  We have first studied these  in the framework of the 3+1 Clifford matrices.  They   comprise non-axial and axial vectors, spin zero particles, antisymmetric tensors, and, under a choice of the Lorentz generators, even spin 1/2 particles of a given chirality. We have  investigated a   gauge symmetry of the equation.  A comparison among the different solutions is possible with the application of a generalized point product within the quantum mechanical framework of the equation.   Through it the transition amplitude of a vector field and two fermions is a  vertex, and hence, it is interpreted as an interaction. The coupling constant is  then determined.  We have also investigated the simplest  generalization  of the equation which is in the context of a  5+1 dimensional Clifford algebra. By focusing on the 3+1 underlying structure we have obtained an $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$  symmetry. We get a boson  and fermion set of  solutions for the massless case. The addition of  a mass term to the equation  implies the breaking of the symmetry to a $U(1)_Q$, which can be interpreted as the gauge symmetry defining  the electromagnetic interaction.  We  also  obtain the field solutions, their spectrum, and some of the couplings among them. We have shown they exhibit a close similarity to the particles and coupling constants  in the  $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$  sector of the standard model at symmetry breaking.      %Lorentz-gauge The main result  in this work has been to derive gauge interactions and the particle spectrum  from an extended spin space,  some of whose components transform under  the usual Lorentz generators in  3+1 space-time. The gauge forces emerge as excitation  determined by the symmetries permitted by the Clifford algebra in which  the 3+1 subalgebra is embedded. Thus, we find a  relation between    gauge and space-time symmetries. In    the simplest Clifford algebra containing the 3+1 subalgebra, we have found a symmetry as large as $U(2)_L\times U(2)_R$  and  we have shown we have only two choices for a model with a $SU(2)_L\times  U(1)$ which  contains both fermions and bosons. %CHECK The $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_L$ symmetry  group  is consequently derived rather than being imposed. It is noteworthy that the  chiral nature of the $SU(2)$ gauge interaction is predicted.  The  formalism also  predicts gauge vector carriers which are as well generators lying in the adjoint  representation of the group.      %interactions In general,  a  field theory is determined by the couplings among fields, which are defined at tree level. The power of field theory in describing nature stems from the possibility of using this  simple description in perturbation theory to account for  more complex behavior by  considering  repeated interactions. The values of the coupling constants are arbitrary and must be fixed by experiment. %THIS SOUNDS TOO CORNY. PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE. In our case, the very nature of the fermion and boson solutions defines the coupling  at tree level.  In fact, our theory determines the type of fields involved and the normalization restriction fixes the   values of  the coupling constants. It is the compositeness feature of the solutions, the fact that some may be constructed from the product of others, that determines their interaction. For example, the form of  the spin 1/2 particle pair coupling to vectors and scalar particles is restrained by the symmetries of the theory. %ALSO HERE Thus, the restrictiveness in the choice of  the representations in our theory  constitutes  also its asset.       %fermion,  In the model described in eq. \ref{{geneqIII}  we have obtained   leptons with the correct gauge quantum numbers corresponding to  a left-handed doublet of $SU(2)$ (that is, in the fundamental representation) with hypercharge $Y=-1$, and a singlet with $Y=-2$, which can be interpreted as  massless neutrinos and  charged leptons. These fields  appear in doublets characterized by a conserved quantum number which does not affect interactions with vector bosons and which we have therefore  associated with flavor. The flavor doublets  are   a consequence of using a Hamiltonian which allows for a certain matrix solution space, although the size of the flavor multiplet can change in higher dimensional models. This may constitute   a clue on the puzzle of generations. Furthermore, the fermions have a  conserved lepton number.  Thus the  fermions obtained could be identified with any pairs of the particle set $e$,  $\nu_e$;  $\mu$, $\nu_\mu$; and $\tau$, $\nu_\tau$.       %Higgs spectrum and massive terms   We  have also  obtained a spinless boson doublet with  $Y=-1$ which can  be identified with a Higgs particle. It is interesting   that this boson appears here as part of the solution representations and  not put in by hand. We obtain that introducing a mass term into the equation, as represented by eq. \ref{{eqIIImass}, implies an additional interaction of the scalar particle which gives masses to some of the fields. We have shown the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry is broken to a $U(1)_Q$ symmetry.  This procedure goes further than the SM where the Higgs mechanism is a mathematical device to create massive terms,  and which  requires explicitly that $U(1)_Q$ remain unbroken. In our case the presence  of a mass term implies it is $U(1)_Q$ the unbroken  gauge symmetry in the real world.  We have obtained masses for  the vector bosons different  to those in the SM. We have ascribed this difference to the fact that the $6-d$ model does not allow for massless vector solutions, which is permitted in the next Clifford algebra at 7+1 dimensions. It is encouraging that the values obtained then for the coupling constants are within $7\%-15\%$ of their values in the SM at electroweak breakdown. The accordance of the values of the coupling constants, vertices  and particles described in the theory is further fortified  by the fact that other  reducible representations will reproduce only some aspects while others will change. For example, the trace, which fixes the interaction, is representation-dependent.     %gauge problem There remain several aspects to be studied. The argument leading to the quantization condition in eq. \ref{{quanLorentz} implies the present equations carry on with them an implied gauge-fixing. While we have shown in detail the extent to which this is true in the abelain case, we still have to prove this for the non-abelian case. Analogy with the non-abelian QFT description requires ghosts to satisfy unitarity. These are scalar objects lying in the adjoint representation which do not appear as physical particles. We speculate  spurious degrees of freedom as  the antisymmetric  $n$ and $v$  could conform such a counterpart in extended theories. We have  a different characterization of the spinless  and  $Z_\mu$, $W_\mu$ fields from  the  corresponding ones  in the SM in relation to their discrete transformation properties, since we get different weights for their scalar or psudoscalar, and $V$, $A$ contributions, respectively. As the  $Z_\mu$, $W_\mu$ particles interact only weakly and this characteristics fit into their interaction scheme this aspect is,   however,  difficult to test.   Furthermore, the interactions among vectors need further study. We attribute  the mass of the lepton to be of the same magnitude as for the $W_\mu$ to the unified approach we use.  The possibility of this theory providing information on the corrections to lepton masses  is under investigation.     %quantization Finally, we have heuristically obtained fields  which reproduce properties of  quantized operators in a quantum field theory. The implication is that quantization is not derived  as a condition on the fields but as a consequence of the definitions of the equations. This points out at a closer relation to quantization which should be researched with more detail in the future. Causality and unitarity requirements demand   more  study on related  aspects as propagators, commutation relations,  and   how to include radiative corrections. %What is needed to do CONNECT WITH ABOVE.  The presence of   bosons and fermions solutions  became possible from the use of bi-spinors as solution space. Further extensions with the use  of more spin indices will allow for  a description of spin 3/2 and spin 2 objects;  this may point to a  connection to gravity. This possibility can be used in turn to propose  a new   interpretation of the wave function, with the implication of a a closer connection of it  to space-time. The development of this idea is done from another standpoint elsewhere (Besprosvany, 2000). %\cite{{BesproWonder}   The similarity in the representation of the fields in this formalism and the operators which carry out a Lorentz transformation for the spin parts could imply a possible connection between these two. Thus, a  Lorentz transformation could be considered not  independent of the fields needed to perform it physically. On the other hand,  just as the choice  of gauge interaction is restricted  by the Clifford algebras, we also find that the  interactions restrain the possible type of  space-time symmetry.  In this way we obtain a possible clue on the origin of the number of dimensions of space-time. Thus, although its (3,1)   structure is not predicted it is among  the few which are  consistent with a $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ symmetry, in the 5+1 dimensional Clifford algebra.  The unified treatment of space-time and gauge symmetries proposed here has proven fruitful. The formalism presented  has the quality of  giving information on a set of  representation solutions and their interactions  by literally restricting them. Their agreement with aspects of the standard model  makes the theory a plausible alternative, all the more that it  assumes a rather conventional  relativistic quantum mechanical framework,   of proven  simplicity and universality. Information on additional aspects of the standard model may be found with the application of the theory in extended spaces, making certainly worth its further study.  \noindent{{\bf Acknowledgements}  The author acknowledges support from  DGAPA-UNAM through project IN127298 and CONACYT through project 3275-PE.    \noindent{{\bf Appendix}  We set here the conventions for the Clifford algebras used  in this work and we present explicitly the matrices generating it.  In 4-$d$ we use the metric \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{metric} g_{{\mu\nu}=  \left( \begin{{array}{{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 &  0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0  & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1  & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0  & -1 \end{{array} \right). \end{{eqnarray}  The $4\times 4$ matrices in the paper are in the Dirac representation, and in order to define them we use the Pauli matrices $\sigma_i$, $i=1,2,3$ and the $2\times2$ unit matrix $1_2$: \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{gamma0}  \gamma_0=\sigma_3\otimes 1_2=\left( \begin{{array}{{cc} 1_2  & 0   \\   0  & -1_2 \end{{array} \right), \end{{eqnarray} so the vector ${{\boldmathgamma}=(\gamma^1,\gamma^2,\gamma^3)$ is given by \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{gammavec}  \boldmathgamma=i\sigma_2\otimes \boldmathsigma= \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} 0  & \boldmathsigma\\   -\boldmathsigma& 0 \end{{array} \right). \end{{eqnarray} From here all other matrices can be defined. For example, \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{gamma5}  \gamma_5=-i\gamma_0\gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_3=\sigma_1\otimes 1_2= \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} 0  & 1_2   \\   1_2  & 0 \end{{array} \right). \end{{eqnarray}  For the 6-$d$ Clifford algebra we use \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{metric6} g_{{\mu\nu}=  \left( \begin{{array}{{cccccc} 1 & 0 & 0 &  0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1  & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0  & -1& 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0  & 0& -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0  & 0& 0 & -1 \end{{array} \right). \end{{eqnarray}  The definitions  leading to eqs. \ref {{sustitution} and  \ref{{sustitutionsca}  imply the 4-$d$ vectors subset of $8\times 8$  matrices are given explicitly by \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{gammamup}  \gamma_\mu^\prime=1_2\otimes\gamma_\mu= \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} \gamma_\mu & 0\\   0  & \gamma_\mu \end{{array} \right),\ \  \mu=0,1,3, \end{{eqnarray}  \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{gamma2p}  \gamma_2^\prime=\sigma_1\otimes\gamma_2= \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} 0  & \gamma_2\\   \gamma_2 & 0 \end{{array} \right), \end{{eqnarray} and the 4-$d$  scalars by \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{sca4} 1_8=1_2\otimes1_4= \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} 1_4 & 0\\   0  &1_4 \end{{array} \right), \end{{eqnarray} \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{sca1} I=\sigma_1\otimes 1_4=\left( \begin{{array}{{cc} 0 & 1_4\\   1_4  & 0 \end{{array} \right), \end{{eqnarray} \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{sca2} i\gamma_5^\prime=i J \gamma_2=i\sigma_2\otimes\gamma_2= \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} 0&  \gamma_2\\   -\gamma_2  & 0 \end{{array} \right), \end{{eqnarray} \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{sca3} i\gamma_6^\prime=i K \gamma_2=i\sigma_3\otimes\gamma_2= \left( \begin{{array}{{cc} i\gamma_2 & 0\\   0  & -i\gamma_2 \end{{array} \right). \end{{eqnarray} All $8\times 8$ matrices can  be generated by products of these matrices. We use a notation for  which the $\gamma_\mu^\prime$ matrices  are written in terms of the $\gamma_\mu$ matrices and   from eq. \ref{{sustitution} onwards the latter are assumed to be $8\times 8$ matrices.                 \setcounter{{equation}{{0}  %\hskip  \begin{{thebibliography}{{99}  \bibitem{{Bargmann} V.

The origin  of  the interaction groups, the particles' spectrum and representations, and parameters has remained largely unexplained. Still, the generalization of features of the model into larger structures with a unifying principle has suggested connections among the observables. Thus, additional dimensions in Kaluza-Klein theories are associated with gauge interactions, and  larger groups in grand-unified theories$\cite{{unification}$ put some restrictions on them. Spin is a physical manifestation of the   fundamental representation of the Lorentz group  and it is more so   in relation to  space,  which uses the vector representation. By setting Poincar\'e-invariant field equations on an extended spin space$\cite{{Jaime}$, described by a Clifford algebra, this letter finds restrictions on and classifies the symmetries and the representation solutions, at given dimension. They contain spin-1/2 and boson solutions with a fixed scalar representation.  A field theory can be formulated in terms of such degrees of freedom. By constraining only the dimension of the spin space on which the fields are formulated, we derive  the interactions and representations of the SM at 9+1 dimensions, the minimal space that contains them.   %fermion and boson field equations with gauge and %Poincar\'e symmetries    %\centerline{{PACS: 12.10.-g, 04.50.+h, 14.80.Cp, 03.70.+k } %\vskip 1cm   %14.80.Cp Non-standard-model Higgs bosons  %03.70.+k Theory of quantized fields (see also 11.10 Field theory) %12.10.Dm Unified theories and models of strong and electroweak interactions %11.15.-q Gauge field theories %12.10.-g Unified field theories and models %04.50.+h Gravity in more than four dimensions, Kaluza-Klein theory, unified field theories, %alternative theories of gravity (see also 11.25.M Compactification and %four-dimensional models)  %\centerline{{Keywords: unification, space-time, gauge, couplings, leptons} %\baselineskip 22pt \vfil\eject \noindent    %\section {{Introduction}   The Dirac equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeq} \gamma_0( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M)\Psi ={{ 0}, \end{{eqnarray} uses an extended spin space  when $\Psi$ represents a matrix instead of, as traditionally, a  four-entries (column) spinor. Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} contains four conditions over four spinors in a $4\times 4$ matrix. %States are further characterized % below.  There are, then, additional possible transformations and symmetry operations  that further classify $\Psi$.  The Dirac-operator transformation $( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M)\rightarrow {{U}(\it i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M) {{U^{{-1}}$ %SHOULD WE CHANGE THE ORDER?  induces the left-hand side of the transformation \begin{{eqnarray} \label  {{transfo}  \Psi\rightarrow U \Psi U^\dagger, \end{{eqnarray} and $\Psi$ is  postulated to transform  as indicated on the right-hand side.    That the equation, the transformation and symmetry operators $U$,  and the solutions $\Psi$  occupy the same space is not only  economical but  it befittingly   implements  quantum mechanics, for it ultimately implies measuring apparatuses are not constituted differently in principle from the objects they measure.    $U$ and $\Psi$ can be classified in terms of  Clifford algebras. In four dimensions (4-$d$) $U$ is conventionally a $4\times 4$ matrix   containing symmetry operators as the Poincar\'e generators,   but it  can contain others, although,     e. g., in the  chiral  massless case it   can only carry an additional $U(2)$ scalar symmetry$\cite{{Jaime}$.    % CHECK POSITION More symmetry operators appear  if Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq},  $\mu=0,...,3,$ is assumed within  the larger Clifford algebra ${{\mathcal C}_{{N},$  $\{{ \gamma_\mu ,\gamma_\nu \} =2 g_{{\mu\nu}$, $\mu,\nu=0,...,N-1$, where   $N$ is the  (assumed even) dimension,  whose structure is   helpful in classifying the available symmetries, and which   is represented  by  $2^{{N/2}\times 2^{{N/2}$  matrices.   The  usual 4-$d$ Lorentz symmetry,  generated in terms of    $\sigma_{{\mu\nu}=\frac{{i}{{2}[ \gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu  ],$  $\mu ,\nu =0,...,3$, is  maintained and   $U$  contains also $ \gamma_a$, $a=4,...,N-1$,  and their  products as possible symmetry  generators. Indeed, these elements are  scalars for they commute  with the Poincar\'e generators, which contain  $\sigma_{{\mu\nu}$, and they are also  symmetry operators  of  the massless  Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq},  bilinear in the $\gamma_\mu$ matrices, which is not   necessarily the case for mass terms (containing  $\gamma_0$).  In addition, their products with    $\gamma_5=-i\gamma_0\gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_3$  are Lorentz  pseudoscalars.  As  $[\gamma_5,\gamma_a]=0$,   we can classify the (unitary) symmetry algebra as   ${{\mathcal S}_{{N-4}={{\mathcal S}_{{(N-4)R} \times {{\mathcal S}_{{(N-4)L},$   consisting of the projected  right-handed ${{\mathcal S}_{{(N-4)R}= \frac{{1}{{2}(1+\gamma_5)U(2^{{(N-4)/2})$ and left-handed ${{\mathcal S}_{{(N-4)L}= \frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)U(2^{{(N-4)/2})$   components.   The solutions of Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} do not span all the matrix  complex space, but this is achieved by considering also solutions of \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeqnext} \Psi\gamma_0( -i \stackrel{{\leftarrow}{{ \partial_\mu}\gamma^\mu -M) ={{ 0}, \end{{eqnarray}  consistent with the transformation in Eq. \ref{{transfo},  (the Dirac operator  transforming accordingly).  It is not possible to find always solutions that simultaneously satisfy equations of the type   \ref{{Jaimeq} and \ref{{Jaimeqnext} (except trivially), which means they are not simultaneously on-shell, but they satisfy at least one and therefore the Klein-Gordon  equation. Indeed, the solutions of eqs. \ref{{Jaimeq} and \ref{{Jaimeqnext}, can  be generally characterized as  bosonic  since   $\Psi$ can be understood to be formed of spinors as $\sum_{{i,j} a_{{ij} |w_i \rangle\langle w_j |$.  Generalized operators acting on this  tensor-product space (spinor $\times$ spinor $ \times$ configuration or momentum space) further characterize the solutions. Positive-energy solutions, according to Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} are interpreted as negative-energy solutions from the right-hand side. This problem is overcome if we assume the hole interpretation for the $\langle w_j |$ components, which amounts to the requirement that operators generally acting from the right-hand side acquire a minus, and that   the commutator be used for operator evaluation.  Thus, the 4-$d$ plane-wave solution combination $\frac{{1}{{4}[(1- \gamma_5)\gamma_0(\gamma_1-i \gamma_2)]e^{{-i kx}$, with $k^\mu=(k,0,0,k),$ is a massless vector$-$axial ($V-A$) state propagating along $\hat {{\bf z}$ with left-handed circular polarization, normalized covariantly according to $\langle    \Psi_A   | {{ \Psi_B}\rangle =tr\Psi_A^\dagger \Psi_B,$ the generalized inner product for the solution space. In fact, combinations of solutions of Eqs. \ref{{Jaimeq} and \ref{{Jaimeqnext} can be formed with a well-defined   Lorentz index:   vector  $\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$, pseudo-vector $\gamma_5\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$, scalar $\gamma_0$, pseudoscalar $\gamma_0\gamma_5$, and antisymmetric tensor $\gamma_0[\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu]$.   For example,  ${{ A}^{{\mathcal C}_\mu(x) =\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_0\gamma_\mu e^{{-i    kx}$  is a combination  that  transforms  under parity into $ {{ A}^{{{{\mathcal C}\mu} (\tilde x ),$ $\tilde x_\mu=x^\mu,$ that is, as a vector.  We may also view $\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$ as  an orthonormal polarization  basis, $A_\mu=tr\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma_\mu A^\nu\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma_\nu$\footnote{{As for  $\bar \psi=\psi^\dagger\gamma_0$, a unitary transformation can be  applied to  the fields and operators to convert them to a covariant form.}; just as    $n_\mu$ in   $A_\mu=g_{{\mu\nu}A^\nu =n_\mu\cdot A^\nu n_\nu$. In fact, the sum of  Eqs.  of \ref{{Jaimeq} and  \ref{{Jaimeqnext} implies $\cite{{Bargmann}$  for a $\Psi$ containing $\gamma_0\slash\!\!\!\! A={{ A}^\mu\gamma_0\gamma_\mu $  that  ${{  A}^\mu$ satisfies the free Maxwell's equations.  Solutions   contain also products of $\gamma_a$ matrices  that define their scalar-group representation.  For given  $N$, there are variations of  the symmetry algebra depending on the chosen Poincar\'e generators and Dirac equation, respectively, through the  projection operators ${{\mathcal P}_P,\ {{\mathcal P}_D\in {{\mathcal S}_{{N-4}$, $[{{\mathcal P}_P,{{\mathcal P}_D]=0$. ${{\mathcal P}_P$ acts as in, e.g., ${{\mathcal P}_P\sigma_{{\mu\nu}$, and  ${{\mathcal P}_D$ modifies  Eqs. \ref{{Jaimeq} and \ref{{Jaimeqnext}  through ${{\mathcal P}_D\gamma_0( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M).$ Together, they characterize   the  Lorentz and scalar-group solution representations.   We require     ${{\rm rank}{{\mathcal P}_D \le   {{\rm rank} {{\mathcal P}_P$, for otherwise pieces of the solution space exist that do not transform properly. For ${{\mathcal P }_D\neq 1$  Lorentz operators  act trivially on one side  of the solutions containing $ 1-{{\mathcal P }_P $,  since $(1-{{\mathcal P }_P){{\mathcal P }_P=0$,  so we also get fermions.   Fig. 1{{(a)} depicts the distribution of Lorentz-representation solutions according to the matrix space they occupy in ${{\mathcal S}_{{6}$, when ${{\mathcal P}_P =   {{\mathcal P}_D \neq 1$. Although it refers to $N=10$ case, it is  general for  any $N$.     An interactive field theory can be constructed in terms of the above  degrees of freedom. %Lorentz and scalar-group indexes  are fixed We consider a  vector  and fermion non-abelian gauge-invariant theory. The expression for the kinetic component of the Lagrangian density ${{ \mathcal L}_{{V}= -\frac{{1}{{4}F_{{\mu\lambda}^ag^{{\lambda\eta}\delta_{{ab} F^{{b\mu}_{{\ \  \eta}=-\frac{{1}{{4 N_o}tr {{\mathcal   P}_D F_{{\mu\lambda}^a\gamma_0\gamma^{{\lambda} G_a F^{{b\mu}_{{\ \ \eta}\gamma_0\gamma_ \eta G_b$  shows ${{\mathcal   L}_{{V}$ is equivalent to a trace over combinations over normalized components $\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{ N_o}}\gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_a $ with coefficients $F^a_{{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu A_\nu^a- \partial_\nu^a A_\mu^a+ g A_\mu^b A_\nu^c C^a_{{bc}$, $g$ the coupling constant,  $\gamma_\mu\in{{\mathcal C}_{{N}$, $G_a\in {{\mathcal S}_{{N-4} $ the group generators, $C^a_{{bc}$ the structure constants,   and $N_o=trG_a G_a $, where for non-abelian irreducible representations we use $trG_i G_j=2 \delta_{{ij}$.      Similarly,   the interactive part of the fermion gauge-invariant Lagrangian %==\slash\!\!\!\!A $ {{\mathcal   L}_{{f}=\frac{{1}{{2}{{\psi^\alpha}^\dagger\gamma_0( i\stackrel{{\leftrightarrow}\partial_\mu-g A^a_\mu G_a )\gamma^\mu\psi^\alpha,$  with $\psi^\alpha$  a  massless spinor with flavor $\alpha$, can be written    ${{\mathcal   L}_{{int} = -g\frac{{1}{{ 2 N_o} tr {{\mathcal P}_D A_{{\mu}^a \gamma_0\gamma^\mu G_a j^{{b\alpha}_\lambda \gamma_0\gamma_\lambda G_b,$    with  $ j_\mu^{{a\alpha}=tr{{\Psi^\alpha}^\dagger\gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_a \Psi^\alpha$  containing $\Psi^\alpha=\psi^\alpha\langle \alpha |$, and $\langle \alpha|$  is a row  state accounting for the flavor.  ${{\mathcal   L}_{{int}$ is written in terms of  $\gamma_0\slash\!\!\!\! A$,  and $\gamma_0\slash\!\!\!j^{{a\alpha}$,  that is, the vector field and the current occupy   the same spin space. This connection and the quantum field theory (QFT) understanding of this vertex as the transition operator between fermion states, exerted by a vector particle, with the coupling constant as a measure of the  transition probability,  justifies the  interpretation  for it $\frac{{1}{{2}g A^{{a\mu} j^{{a\alpha}_\mu= A^{{a\mu}\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{ N_o}} tr{{\Psi^\alpha}^\dagger \gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_a\Psi^\alpha$, leading to the  identification $g\rightarrow 2\sqrt{{ \frac{{K}{{ N_o}}$, $K$ correcting for  over-counted  reducible representations, which is further clarified below. The theoretical assignment of $g$ complements QFT, in which the coupling constant  is set  experimentally.   It should be also understood as tree-level information, while the values  are modified by the presence of a virtual cloud of fields, at given energy. Although in QFT the coupling constant  is obtained  perturbatively in terms of powers of  the bare, which takes  infinite values  absorbed through renormalization,  we may take the view that renormalization is a calculational device and that its physical value  is a manifestation of the bare one;  this is feasible for  small  coupling constants,  which  can give  small corrections. Energy corrections are also necessary for a more detailed calculation.    As for the initial formulation, ${{\mathcal P}_D$ restricts the possible gauge symmetries that can be constructed in the Lagrangian, for $ \gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_i$ needs to be contained in  the space it projects. Thus, ${{\mathcal P}_P$ and ${{\mathcal P}_D$ determine the symmetries,    which are global, and  in turn, determine the  allowed gauge interactions. Furthermore, they  fix the representations, assumed physical. % The gauge vectors  are represented not in an abstract way but % in the solutions themselves. The $N=6$ case has been  researched$\cite{{Jaime}$ and connections have been found to the  $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$, electroweak sector of the SM.  It is   apparent that the minimal algebra that includes the SM groups   requires $N=9+1$, with  ${{\mathcal S}_6$, on which we will concentrate.  There are  limited ways in which we may represent the SM  interactions in such a matrix space and only one giving the correct fermion  and boson quantum numbers.  In order to have fermions we need ${{\mathcal P}_P \neq 1$. Account of the quark quantum numbers requires that their left-handed $SU(3)\times  SU(2)_L$, and right-handed   $SU(3)\times  U(1)_Y$ symmetry generators   be direct-product reducible representations  occupying,   respectively,   $6\times 6$ matrix pieces of ${{\mathcal S}_{{6L}$  and   ${{\mathcal S}_{{6R}$. The remaining  $2\times 2$  matrix   into which  ${{\mathcal S}_{{6L}$ is broken is associated  to the $SU(2)_L$ acting on the $SU(3)$-singlet  leptons, and that of ${{\mathcal S}_{{6R}$ to a $U(1)$  describing the right-handed leptons hypercharge, and an inert $U(1)$ that gives  rise to two fermion  generations (all this applies also to antiparticles).   There are additional $U(1)$ symmetries which can be  assigned in correspondence to SM symmetries.       To represent  these ${{\mathcal S}_{{6}$ terms, we use the 64 matrices composed of 6  $\tilde\gamma_{{a-4}=\gamma_{{a}$, $a=5,...,9$, $\tilde \gamma_0=i \gamma_4$, 15 pairs $\tilde\gamma_{{ab}=\tilde\gamma_a\tilde \gamma_b$, $a< b,$ etc., 20 triplets $\tilde\gamma_{{abc}=\tilde \gamma_{{a} \tilde \gamma_b\tilde \gamma_{{c}$, 1 sextuplet $\bar\gamma_7=\tilde\gamma_0\tilde\gamma_1\tilde\gamma_2\tilde\gamma_3\tilde\gamma_4\tilde\gamma_5,$ %$\bar\gamma_5=i\tilde\gamma_0\tilde\gamma_1\tilde\gamma_2\tilde\gamma_3$,  15 quadruplets  % quitar? $\tilde\gamma_{{7ab}=\tilde\gamma_7\tilde\gamma_{{ab}$, 6 quintuplets  $\tilde \gamma_{{7a}=\bar\gamma_7\tilde\gamma_a$,  and the identity $1$.   ${{\mathcal S}_{{6}$ has  a Cartan algebra of dimension 8+8,  which  we write in terms  of the projection operators $P_{{R}=\frac{{1}{{4}(1-\tilde\gamma_0)  (1+\tilde\gamma_{{73})$, $P_{{S\pm}= \frac{{1}{{2}(1\mp i\tilde\gamma_{{26})$. The  latter  contains  the  baryon  numbers $P_{{B(V\pm A)}=\frac{{1}{{2}(1\pm\gamma_5)(1-P_{{R})$, with  $V\pm A$  components;   $SU(3)$ $\lambda_{{3(V\pm A)}=\frac{{1}{{2}P_{{B(V\pm A)}[P_{{S+}(\tilde\gamma_4+\tilde\gamma_{{73}) + P_{{S-}(\tilde\gamma_4+\tilde \gamma_{{703})] $, $\lambda_{{8(V\pm A)}=\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{3}}P_{{B(V\pm A)}[P_{{S+} (-\tilde\gamma_4+\tilde\gamma_{{73}-2  \tilde\gamma_{{703})+ P_{{S-}(-\tilde\gamma_4 -2\tilde\gamma_{{73}+\tilde\gamma_{{703})] $; lepton numbers $P_{{L(V+A)}=\frac{{1}{{2}(1+\gamma_5)P_{{R}P_{{S+},$ $P_{{L(V-A)}=\frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)P_{{R};$  $SU(2)_L$ $I_3= (P_{{B(V-A)}+P_{{L(V-A)})i\tilde\gamma_{{26};$  flavor operators generated by $P_{{F}=\frac{{1}{{2}(1+\gamma_5)P_{{R}P_{{S-}$ (and additional); hypercharges $Y_\pm= \frac{{1}{{2}(1\pm\gamma_5)[P_{{L(V-A)}- \frac{{1}{{3}P_{{B(V-A)}+2 P_{{L(V+A)}+ \frac{{1}{{3}P_{{B(V+A)}(2 P_{{S+}-4P_{{S-})]$; isocolor $\bar\lambda_{{j(V- A)}=\lambda_{{j(V- A)}I_3$,  and hypercolor $\bar\lambda_{{j(V+A)}=\frac{{1}{{3}\lambda_{{j(V+A)}  P_{{B(V+A)+}(4 P_{{S+}+2P_{{S-})$, $j=3,8$.          The  choice $Y=Y_++Y_-$  that gives the correct hypercharge fermion quantum numbers can be deduced from the condition that it not be axial, separately for quarks and leptons, namely, $tr\gamma_5  YL  =0,$ and $tr\gamma_5 YB =0$, where $L=P_{{L(V+A)}+ P_{{L(V-A)},$ $B=P_{{B(V+A)}+ P_{{B(V-A)}$,  which leads to the correct ratios between right-handed and left-handed lepton and quark hypercharges. The anomaly-cancellation condition sets the ratio between lepton and quark hypercharges. For $N=6$, $Q=\frac{{1}{{2}Y+I_3 $ can also be deduced$\cite{{Jaime}$ as one of the operators commuting with the Hamiltonian when mass terms are added, which sets the form of $Y$.      ${{\mathcal P}_P={{\mathcal P}_D= B+L\in  {{\mathcal S}_{{6}$ is the only option describing SM fermions. In Fig. 1{{(a)}-{{(d)} %\ref{{tab:tablejbFBV} are the solution representations resulting from such massless Hamiltonian, classified with the above generators.  Each of the four types of solution  in  {{(a)} is an $8\times 8$ matrix, three of which are given  explicitly in {{(b)}-{{(d)} %\ref{{tab:tablejbFBV} with the solutions' quantum numbers. {{(b)} and {{(d)} contain  vectors (and axial-)   $\gamma$-bilinear  solutions  that  are in the adjoint representation, with {{(b)} also containing the flavor group, and fermion solutions. {{(c)} has $\gamma$-linear solutions conformed of scalar (and pseudo-), antisymmetric tensors, and fermions.  Fixing ${{\mathcal P}_D$, the   physically feasible ($trG_i G_j=2 \delta_{{ij}$) gauge groups are comprised$\cite{{Weinbergbook}$ of the $U(1)$ and compact simple algebras generated in it.  With the conditions of anomaly-cancelling, renormalizability, $B,$  $L$ conservation, the allowed Lagrangian reduces basically to that of the SM, with particles with correct Lorentz and gauge group representations: %\ref{{tab:tablejbFBV}) gluons,  weak,  and hypercharge vectors.  A Higgs-like particle can also be constructed from the neutral and charged scalar   $SU(2)_L$  doublets in  {{(c)}. There are two generations of $SU(2)_L$ lepton and quark doublets $(e,\nu)_L,$ $(u,d)_L$  and $e_R,$ $u_R,$ $d_R$ singlets (generation choice arbitrary). We also find particles beyond the SM as   scalar leptoquarks in {{(b)},  and $V-A$ iso-gluons in {{(c)}.      The   vector-field normalized polarizations  provide the coupling constants.  The physics guides in obtaining  the field configuration, pointing at  overcounted degrees of freedom in $K$ direct-product reducible representations, and gives a clue on the energy scale. For the hypercharge $B_\mu=\frac{{g^\prime}{{2} Y\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$, so $g^\prime=2/[{{2 (2 + 2^2 + 6(\frac{{1}{{3})^2+   3 (\frac{{2}{{3})^2 +3 (\frac{{4}{{3})^2)]^{{1/2}}$ $=\frac{{1}{{2}\sqrt{{\frac{{3}{{5}}\approx .387$.  The normalized weak-boson   component $W_{{B\mu}^{{({{\bf 3},{{\bf 1})}$ (in direct product with $SU(3)$ space) needs to be contracted to $\bar W_{{B\mu}^{{({{\bf 3},{{\bf 1})}$, leading to  its coupling to be rescaled by $\sqrt{{3},$ which gives the same couplings to quarks as to leptons (see   {{(d)}).  Gluons  are described by $\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}(A^{{({{\bf 1},{{\bf 8})}_\mu+\tilde A^{{({{\bf 1},{{\bf 8})}_\mu)$ terms (see  {{(b),}   {{(d)}.) One $2^{{1/2}$ factor  corrects each $V\pm A$  components (same coupling to chiral and massive quarks)  and another $2^{{1/2}$ corrects for the $SU(2)_L$ and hypercharge products. This gives $ g_s =2^2 /[{{2 (2^3 )]^{{1/2}}=1,$ or $\alpha_s=\frac{{g_s^2}{{4 \pi}\approx .080.$ In the case of the physical weak field $W^{{({{\bf 3},{{\bf 1})}_\mu= \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}(\bar W_{{L\mu}^{{({{\bf 3},{{\bf 1})}+W_{{B\mu}^{{({{\bf 3},{{\bf 1})})$,  we assume a single $SU(2)_L$ irreducible representation, for $W_\mu^{{({{\bf 3},{{\bf 1})}$ acts separately on quarks and leptons.  Then  $g = 2 /[{{2 (2^2)]^{{1/2}}=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}\approx .707$.  From the  demand that  a vector particle be obtained with  the correct parity, or others$\cite{{Jaime}$, $Q$ is derived  as the only non-trivial scalar commuting the  Hamiltonian, leading to an expression  for the photon $A_\mu=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{g^2+{{g^\prime}^2}}(g  B_\mu+g^\prime W^0_\mu)$.  One gets Weinberg's angle $\theta_W$ from here. It can also  be consistently obtained    directly from $g$ and $g^\prime$.   From the SM\cite{{Glashow} $tan(\theta_W)=g^\prime/g$,  so $sin^2(\theta_W)=3/13\approx .23078.$  The assumed fermion massive terms and electroweak symmetry-breaking conditions suggest a      comparison of  these numbers with experimental values at energies of order $M_Z.$ These are$\cite{{tables}$, one standard-deviation last-ciphers uncertainty in parenthesis, $g_{{ex}^\prime=.35743(8)$, $sin^2(\theta_{{Wex})= .23117(16),$ and $\alpha_{{s(ex)}=.1185(20)$.    Unified-generator  fields are obtained when assuming that $Y$ and $I_3$ belong to the same group, thus having the same normalization convention, so $g^\prime$ needs to be rescaled to $g_1^{{uni}=\sqrt{{\frac{{5}{{3}}{{{{g^\prime}^{{uni}}$. From the assumption that $g_1=g$  and  that  $I_3$ acts equally on  massless chiral  leptons or quarks, we get $g^{{uni}=2/{{[2(8)]^{{1/2}}=\frac{{1}{{2}$ ($K=1$), and recover the $SU(5)$ unification result$\cite{{quinn}$ $sin^2(\theta_W^{{uni})=3/8$.   The theory thus presented succeeds in reproducing many aspects of the  SM. We obtain the groups $SU(2)_L\times SU(3)\times U(1)$, with corresponding  vector bosons  acting on quarks  and leptons in two generations with correct quantum numbers and chiralities. A Higgs particle is also obtained. By using the allowed vertices with normalized-polarisation fields we are able to calculate coupling constants, around electroweak breaking. It is not obvious that SM features can be described and yet a special model configuration among few possible gives such predictions. An assortment  of new particles beyond the SM are also obtained but not all need be stable or  appear at low energies.  With  the  Poincar\'e  and SM-gauge symmetric  Lagrangian presentation of the model, renormalization and quantization can be applied, leading to a QFT formulation. Its simplicity, with   spin as its basic building block, should allow for a generalization and application in theories such as supersymmetry$\cite{{wess}$ and those accounting for gravity, such as supergravity$\cite{{wess}$ and strings.   There is a robustness to the  predictions, for extension of the model into  such structures,  requiring  additional reducible representations and  quantum numbers,  will not change the results.  On the other hand,   inclusion into other models with different irreducible representations should modify them, making  the $N=9+1$ case unique.     The close connection between the results hence derived and the physical particles' phenomenology makes plausible the idea that, as with the spin,   the gauge vector and matter fields, and their interactions  originate in the structure of space-time.            \setcounter{{equation}{{0}  %\hskip  \begin{{thebibliography}{{99}    \bibitem {{unification}  H.

We also lack information on the origin of the particular groups $SU(3)\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ which define the interactions, and on why the isospin acts only  on a given chirality. Neither is it clear the origin of the spectrum of fermions, the three generations, the masses and mixing angles, and the gauge-group fundamental representations in which they appear. The Higgs particle is a useful mathematical device but we lack a more basic reason for its presence.   The idea of unification has proved to be a powerful tool in physical research, finding links between originally assumed separated phenomena, and also predicting new ones. For example, by assuming the SM interactions have a shared origin in the same unified group\cite{{unification} some clues can be obtained on the fermion representations in the SM and also relations among the coupling constants.   %Although quantum mechanics offers a common description for the % shared properties of  bosons and fermions %  it still requires a specialized treatment for each to account %for their differences. Thus, while the spatial description of the %propagation of a fermion is similar to that of a boson this %differs in the spin wave functions. A unified theory describing %both kind of particles  should address the question of their spin.  On another plane, the Kaluza-Klein idea, originally used in the framework of general relativity, has been applied to understand interactions by relating them to additional spatial dimensions. Other unification ideas may shed  more light on particle-physics problems. Spin is a physical manifestation of the   fundamental representation of the Lorentz group  and it is more so   in relation to  space,  which uses the vector representation. While both the spin and configuration spaces are equally necessary elements for the description of particles, the  association of interactions to extended spin spaces is feasible, and gives rise to a model with new connections to the SM\cite{{Jaime},\cite{{Jaimenext}.    In this paper we give a field-theory formulation of the model, providing   it with additional fundament, and we further explore  the 5+1 dimensional case.   We  review the formulation of Poincar\'e-invariant field equations on an extended 5+1 d spin space, and the link of its symmetries and solutions to the SM electroweak  sector. We also show that a  field theory  can be equivalently formulated in such a space and is similarly constrained. Thus, the demand that fields be in a 5+1 dimensional spin space determines the interactions and  representations of the SM electroweak  sector, and additional constraints. In particular, we extract information on the particle masses, using the underlying spin symmetry, and making a comparison with the SM.  We first consider an extended Dirac equation and develop its surrounding formalism, using the conventional relativistic quantum-mechanical framework (Section 2). We show that  boson (Section 3) and fermion (Section 4) solutions are obtained that share  the same spin solution space.     The simplest extension of the equation at 5+1 dimensions predicts an $SU(2)_L\times U(1)$ symmetry.  We obtain solutions with quantum numbers of the corresponding gauge fields, leptons, and scalars interacting electroweakly (Section 5).  Typical Lagrangians are  equivalently written in terms of the above degrees of freedom, with the dimension   determining also the representations and the interactions (Section 6).  A mass term set with an underlying  spin symmetry predicts boson  masses  as in the  SM and  the other particles' (Section 7). We also obtain information on the electroweak SM  coupling constants (Section 8).  %Just  as in %the Kaluza-Klein idea more spatial dimensions are considered in order describe %interactions,  here we  use a larger dimensional Clifford algebra. PUR LATER?   \section{{ Generalized Dirac equation}  We depart from the equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeq} \gamma_0( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M)\Psi ={{ 0}, \end{{eqnarray} where, with the aim of jointly describing  bosons and fermions, we now assume $\Psi$ represents a matrix. Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} contains four conditions over four spinors in a $4\times 4$ matrix.  There are, then, additional possible ones to further classify $\Psi$.  The  transformations and symmetry operations on the Dirac operator  $( i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M)\rightarrow {{U}(\it  i \partial_\mu\gamma^\mu -M) {{U^{{-1}}$ %SHOULD WE CHANGE THE ORDER?  induce the lhs of the transformation \begin{{eqnarray} \label  {{transfo}  \Psi\rightarrow U \Psi U^\dagger. \end{{eqnarray}  Also, $\Psi$ is  postulated to transform  as indicated on the rhs.   The latter transformation  is consistent with the additional equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeqnext} \Psi\gamma_0( -i \stackrel{{\leftarrow}{{ \partial_\mu}\gamma^\mu -M) ={{ 0} \end{{eqnarray} (the Dirac operator  transforming accordingly).\footnote{{The Bargmann-Wigner equations\cite{{Bargmann}  contain Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} but set the different second condition as $\Psi^*_{{BW}\gamma_0 (-i \stackrel{{\leftarrow}{{\partial_\mu}\gamma^\mu-M)={{ 0}$ %, which %will not necessarily be assumed for $\Psi$,  but  used as %reference to classify the solutions of Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq}. Thus, $\Psi^*_{{BW}$ contains charge conjugated $\langle w_j |$ components (see below). } In fact, the conjugated fields $\Psi^\dagger$, for which Eq. \ref{{transfo} is valid, satisfy this equation. It is by taking also account of this kind of fields that we can span the function space within the 32-dimensional complex $4 \times 4$ matrices. Then, we shall extend our space of solutions by considering also combinations of  fields ${{ A}+{{ B}^\dagger$.   $\Psi$ can be understood to be constructed of  a tensor product of the usual configuration (or momentum) space, and a column $|w_i \rangle$ and a row $\langle w_j |$ state that can have a spinor interpretation\cite{{Lifshitz},  with expansion $\sum_{{i,j} a_{{ij} |w_i \rangle\langle w_j | $. The resulting tensor product of operators  acting on this tensor-product space and classifying the solutions  consist generators of the Poincar\'e algebra with spin components, (or scalars) acting as $U$  on each side of $\Psi$, and  derivative ones acting only once, from either side;  products of derivative and spin operators act from both sides. %Alternatively, we can impose the %additional equation %\begin{{eqnarray} %\label {{Jaimeqle} % {{ 0}=   i\partial_\mu\Psi\gamma_0\gamma^\mu -\Psi M\gamma_0 , %\end{{eqnarray} %which induces the rhs transformation in Eq. \ref{{transfo} for the %matrix operator,  The rhs side of Eq. \ref{{transfo} is consistent %with the symmetry transformations of  Eq. \ref{{Jaimeqle} but  it %does exhaust them.    The expansion of $\Psi$  implies it Lorentz transforms  as a scalar, a vector, or an antisymmetric tensor. In fact, we will show below certain choices of symmetry operators allow for a fermion interpretation of some solutions too.    If ${{ A}$, ${{ B}$ are solutions, the matrix product ${{ C}={{ AB}$, defines an algebra whose elements may or may not be solutions. The inner product of ${{ A}$, ${{ B}$  is naturally defined  by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{pointproduct}    \langle  {{ A} | {{ B} \rangle =tr({{ A^\dagger B}), \end{{eqnarray} as expected for  this extended  tensor-product space. A trace over the coordinates is also implied.     We are interested in plane-wave solutions of the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{planewaves} {{ \Psi}^{{(+)}_{{ki}(x)&=&{{ u_i}(k)e^{{-i kx}\\ {{ \Psi}^{{(-)}_{{ki}(x)&=& {{ v_i}(k)e^{{i kx}, \label {{planewavesend}  \end{{eqnarray} where $k^\mu$ is the momentum  four-vector $(E,\bf k)$, $k_0=E$, and $u_i$, $v_i$ are matrices containing information on the polarization. %We shall assume for $\Psi$ the weaker condition %that it only satisfy the sum of Eqs. \ref{{Jaimeq} and \ref{{Jaimeqnext}. As applied to  ${{ \Psi}^{{(+)}_{{ki}(x)$ in Eq. \ref{{planewaves},  Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq} defines the Hamiltonian  $H_{{lhs}=\gamma_0(  {{\bf k }\cdot{{\boldmathgamma}+ M)$  and a projection of the Pauli-Lubansky vector on the  four-vector $n_k=(1/M)( | {{\bf k}| ,E \hat{{{{\bf k}}   )$, $(1/M)W\cdot n_k={{\bf \Sigma}\cdot{{\bf \hat k  }$, which uses \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{angular}  J_{{\mu\nu}=i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu)+\frac{{1}{{2}\sigma_{{\mu\nu}, \end{{eqnarray} with $\sigma_{{\mu\nu}=\frac{{i}{{2}[ \gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu ]$   and the spin operator ${{\bf \Sigma}=\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma_5\gamma_0{{\boldmathgamma}$, which  is valid both for the massless and the massive cases. %By the rules set in Eq. \ref{{transfo} and particulars, the %eigenvalues are obtained by applying %   commutators of  these  operators to % the field solutions. However, ${{ \Psi}^{{(+)}_{{ki}(x)$  is classified by the energy-momentum symmetry operators corresponding to Eq. \ref{{Jaimeqnext} (always in the relativistic quantum-mechanics framework) as a negative-energy solution. A consistent characterization  of the latter can be given if we assume  its rhs $\langle w_j |$ spinor component  to be a hole. This  interpretation is set  for operators acting  on $\Psi$ from the rhs, as well as  on the $\Psi^\dagger$ fields. Thus, the hermitian conjugate of   ${{{{ \Psi}^{{(-)}_k}^\dagger(x)$  in Eq. \ref{{planewavesend} has the same exponential dependence as ${{ \Psi}^{{(+)}_k(x)$ in Eq. \ref{{planewaves}, and is also interpreted as a positive-energy solution.   \section{{ Boson solutions} On Table  \ref{{VmA} are shown solutions of the massless equation \ref{{Jaimeq}, bilinear in the $\gamma$s, and  they are given together with their quantum numbers. We give them in terms of their polarizations, setting the coordinate dependence as in Eq. \ref{{planewaves}, and we assume the spatial component of $k^\mu$ to be along $\hat {{\bf z}$. %e^{{i \bf  p\cdot\hat {{\bf x}}   dependence out % put tilde 1 or -1 ? %FALTA numero i en igualdad Here and throughout the solutions are normalized as $tr( \bfu ^\dagger_ {{i}( {{k)} \bfu _{{i}( {{k)}) =1$. In the first two columns, we  present the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of the operators $O$ in the form $O{{ u}_i({{k} )= \lambda {{ u}_i({{k} )$. %The use of commutators follows  the above %conventions for  the action of the lhs and rhs operators.  The solutions on Table \ref{{VmA} are interpreted as   vector bosons, for  Eq. \ref{{Jaimeq}   alone  implies they satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation and  ${{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}$ classifies their  different degenerate polarization components  as vectors.  According to the direct-product operator convention, the helicity operator  is calculated in the fourth column with ${{\bf\Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}_{{lhs}\Psi+\Psi {{\bf \Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}_{{rhs}$, where ${{\bf\Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf k} }}_{{rhs}$, and its (rhs) eigenvalue are unchanged under the hole interpretation. The use of a commutator follows from the equality ${{\bf\Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}_{{lhs}\Psi+\Psi {{\bf\Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}_{{rhs}={{\bf\Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}_{{lhs}\Psi-\Psi {{\bf\Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }}_{{lhs}\equiv[{{\bf\Sigma\cdot{{\hat{{\bf  k} }},\Psi]$. The third column characterizes the solutions with the application of $H_{{lhs}\Psi+\Psi H_{{rhs}$, with $H_{{rhs}$ coming  from Eq. \ref{{Jaimeqnext}.   Although the rhs spinor of $\bfu_{{-1}({{k})$ is not on-shell, as measured by $H_{{rhs}$,  the latter gives the expected energy sign in the hole interpretation. % A full understanding requires again QFT. %The action from the rhs can be formulated from a covariant %condition Within   these  rules, $\bfu_{{-1}({{k})$, $\bfu_{{-1}({{\tilde k})$ are  on-shell particles with transverse polarizations, with helicity $-1$, propagating respectively in the $\hat {{\bf z}$ and $-\hat {{\bf z}$ directions;  the latter is denoted through the four-vector $\tilde  k^\mu=k_\mu$;  $\bfu_{{0}({{k})$, $\bfu_{{0}( {{\tilde k} )$ are off-shell and polarized in the longitudinal-scalar directions. The $u_i$ solutions  do not represent independent polarization components as, e.g., $\bfu_{{i}({{\tilde k})$ can be obtained by rotating the $\bfu_{{i}({{k})$ (applying a Lorentz transformation of the form \ref {{transfo}).      %Covariance is guaranteed because %of the conditions imposed  on $\Psi$.   %$\bfu_{{-1}({{k})$, $\bfu_{{-1}({{\tilde k})$ do not satisfy Eq. \ref{{Jaimeqnext}    In the massless case, we have also negative-energy solutions ${{ v}_{{ i}({{k} )=\bfu_{{i}(k)$ (and $\tilde k$ terms) from  Eq. \ref{{planewavesend},  that is, with opposite helicities.  The positive-energy solutions containing ${{v}^\dagger (k),$ ${{ v}^\dagger ( \tilde k)  $ have also  opposite helicities. By applying the parity operator $\gamma_0 \wp  $, with $ \wp x_\mu=\tilde x_\mu $, in the form \ref{{transfo} one classifies the solutions according to the weight of the  vector $V$ and axial $A$ components. The solutions in Table \ref{{VmA} are $V-A$, while $V+A$ solutions are also obtained. Their combination, \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Amufirst} {{ A}_\mu(x) =g_{{\mu\nu}(x)\frac{{i}{{2}\gamma_0\gamma^\nu , \end{{eqnarray}  with $g_{{\mu\nu}(x)$ a  polarization tensor,  transforms  into $ {{ A}^\mu ({{\tilde x})$ under parity $P$, that is, as a vector. An axial term can be also obtained. A combination of  ${{ A}_\mu(x)$ and its hermitian conjugate can be shown to transform as a vector under the charge conjugation operator $C=i\gamma_2 \mathcal{{K} $, with  ${{\mathcal{{K}} i = - i  {{\mathcal{{K}} $; given its quantum numbers, %and the presence of off-shell components,  it becomes then possible to relate ${{ A}_\mu(x)$  to the vector potential of an electromagnetic field satisfying Maxwell's equations within the Lorentz gauge. Actually, we may also view $\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$ as  an orthonormal polarization  basis, $A_\mu=tr\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma_\mu A^\nu\frac{{1}{{2}\gamma_\nu$\footnote{{As for  $\bar \psi=\psi^\dagger\gamma_0$, a unitary transformation can be  applied to  the fields and operators to convert them to a covariant form.}; just as    $n_\mu$ in   $A_\mu=g_{{\mu\nu}A^\nu =n_\mu\cdot A^\nu n_\nu$. In fact, the sum of  Eqs.  of \ref{{Jaimeq} and  \ref{{Jaimeqnext} implies   for a $\Psi$ containing $\gamma_0\slash\!\!\!\! A={{ A}^\mu\gamma_0\gamma_\mu $  that  ${{  A}^\mu$ satisfies the free Maxwell's equations$\cite{{Bargmann}$. Both interpretations for  the polarization components as basis for solutions in an extended Dirac equation, and for standard fields shall be considered in this work.        The remaining eight degrees of freedom   in the massless case contain  six forming an antisymmetric tensor ${{ A } _{{\mu\nu}=\frac{{1}{{4} \gamma_0[\gamma_ \mu,\gamma_ \nu], $   and scalar, and pseudoscalar terms ${{\phi }=\frac{{1}{{2} \gamma_0$, ${{\phi _5}=\frac{{1}{{2} \gamma_5\gamma_0$.   \section{{ Fermion  solutions} The chirality invariance allows for more choices of Lorentz generators. Using $J_{{\mu\nu}^-=\frac{{1}{{2} (1-\gamma_5) J_{{\mu\nu}$ in  ${{\bf \Sigma}$ to classify the  solutions in  Table \ref{{VmA},  they remain $V-A$. \begin{{table}[h] %SEE THAT HERE NEITHER v, u are boldfaced, but on the other hand, argument is, unlike above definition.

Having obtained   both fermion  and boson  solutions constitutes progress in the  task of giving a unified description of these fields. Clearly, their nature depends on the Hamiltonian and on the set of valid symmetry  transformations, chosen among limited options. But once the  choice is made, there is no ambiguity.  The equation    \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{Jaimeferq} i(1-\gamma_5) \gamma_0\partial_\mu\gamma^\mu  {{  \Psi}=0 \end{{eqnarray} has all these fields  as solutions. If we stick to $J_{{\mu\nu}^-$ to classify them, the invariance algebra of the equation  has  as  additional symmetry the group of linear complex transformations $G(2,C)$ with eight components, generated by $(1/2) (1+ \gamma_5)$ and $f_{{\mu\nu}=-(i/2)   (1+\gamma_5) \sigma_{{\mu\nu}$. The unitary subgroups $SU(2)\times U(1)$  of   $G(2,C)$ imply two additional quantum numbers we can assign to the  solutions. In consideration that  this symmetry does not act on  the vector solution part, and taking account of the known quantum numbers  of fermions  in nature,  we shall  associate these  operators with the flavor and spin-1/2 number operators, respectively. The  $SU(2)$ set of operators leads   to a flavor doublet.  The $U(1)$ is in this case not independent from the chirality. Choosing $f_{{30}$ to classify the solutions of Eq. \ref{{Jaimeferq}, these  are given in Table \ref{{fermionsend} (as $H$ and ${{\bf \Sigma}\cdot{{\bf \hat p  }$ act trivially from the rhs, commutators are not needed.) Overall, the matrix objects we use allow for a fermion interpretation, for one of its components behaves as a spinor, while the other carries  the flavor quantum number.    \begin{{table}[h] \begin{{eqnarray} Left-handed\  spin\ 1/2 \  particles &  \frac{{1}{{2}(1-\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma^3 & \frac{{i}{{4} (1-\gamma_5)\gamma_1\gamma_2  \ \ [f_{{30},\ ] \nonumber \\ \bfw_{{-1/2}({{ k})  = \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5) (\gamma_0+\gamma_3 ) & 1 & -1/2\ \ 1/2 \nonumber\\ \bfw_{{-1/2}  ({{\tilde   k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5)  (\gamma_1+i\gamma_2 )& -1 & 1/2\ \ 1/2 \nonumber \\ \hat \bfw_{{-1/2}   ({{ k})= \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5 ) (\gamma_1-i\gamma_2 )& 1 & -1/2\  -1/2\nonumber\\ \nonumber \hat \bfw_{{-1/2}({{ \tilde   k})  =  \frac{{1}{{4} (1-\gamma_5) (\gamma_0-\gamma_3 ) & -1 & 1/2\ \ -1/2 \end{{eqnarray} %MAKE THEM RIGHT-HANDED TO RELATE TO Y acting on e^-_L ?{{mass \caption{{Massless  fermions. \label{{fermionsend}} \end{{table}    \section{{ 5+1 Dimensional Extension} The simplest generalization of the above model is to consider the six-dimensional Clifford algebra, (the $d=5$ lives also in a $4\times 4$  space),  composed of  64 $8\times 8$  matrices. To describe it we use  the quaternion-like objects $1$, $I$, $J$, $K$ and now generalized  $8 \times 8$ matrices $\gamma_\mu$ (and $\gamma_5$). A  6-$d$ Clifford algebra $\{{ \gamma_\mu^\prime,\gamma_\nu^\prime \}=g_{{\mu\nu}$ can be formed with   the   $4$-$d$ elements  $\gamma_\mu^\prime=\gamma_\mu,\ \ \mu=0,1,3,$ $\gamma_2^\prime=I \gamma_2$, and the 4-$d$ scalars $\gamma_5^\prime=  J \gamma_2,\  \gamma_6^\prime=  K \gamma_2$. Altogether, the scalars (and pseudo-) are $1$, $I$, $J \gamma_2$, $K \gamma_2$, $\gamma_5$, $I\gamma_5$, $J \gamma_2\gamma_5$, $K \gamma_2\gamma_5$. From these,  $I\gamma_5$ commutes with the rest. Excluding it and  the identity, the remaining six elements generate an $SO(4)$ algebra, or equivalently, an $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ algebra. The eight scalars have a Cartan algebra of dimension four, for which we can take the basis $1$, $I$, $\gamma_5$, $I\gamma_5$.   We obtain the useful prediction of a limited number of scalar symmetries and representations consistent with the 4-$d$ Lorentz symmetry. We may choose among them the closest to reproduce aspects of the SM. The only projector operator $L$ that can be constructed with the latter operators, describes both fermions and bosons through the Lorentz generator $J_{{\mu\nu}^L=LJ_{{\mu\nu}^\prime$, with $J_{{\mu\nu}^\prime= i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu)+\frac{{1}{{2}\sigma_{{\mu\nu}^\prime$, $\sigma_{{\mu\nu}^\prime=\frac{{i}{{2}[\gamma_\mu^\prime,\gamma_\nu^\prime]$, allows for a non-abelian group symmetry, and permits parity to be a good quantum number for some solutions is\cite{{Jaime} $L=\frac{{3}{{4}-\frac{{1}{{4}(I+\gamma_5+I \gamma_5 )=1-\frac{{1}{{4}(1+I)(1+I \gamma_5)$; the latter can be interpreted as the lepton number. The equation \begin{{eqnarray} \label {{geneqIII} i L\gamma_0  \partial^\mu\gamma_\mu^\prime \Psi=0,\ \mu=0,...,3, \end{{eqnarray} is invariant under $J_{{\mu\nu}^L$, and allows for a flavor symmetry as defined previously. It is also invariant under  the $L$-commuting  scalars: the  hypercharge $Y=-1+1/2(I+\gamma_5),$ and the isospin $SU(2)_L$ with generators  \begin{{eqnarray}  \label {{iso}  I_1&=&\frac{{i}{{4}(1-I\gamma_5)J\gamma_2 ,\\ I_2&=&-\frac{{i}{{4}(1-I\gamma_5)K\gamma_2,\\ I_3&=&-\frac{{1}{{4}(1-I\gamma_5)I \label {{isolast}; \end{{eqnarray} this  identification of $Y$ and $I_i$ comes from their commuation relations, and  from the correct vertices and quantum numbers they determine on the bosons and leptons, as argued below. $Y$ can also be deduced from other requirements\cite{{Jaime} related to gauge symmetry.   These  scalars  lead, as expected,   to a restricted set of solutions. The massless positive  solutions are shown schematically     on Table \ref{{tab:tablejb} (see  Ref. \cite{{Jaime} for details) and they include $V-A$ and $V$+$A$ vectors, with  components $B_\mu=\frac{{1}{{4\sqrt{{2}}(1-I)(1+I\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\mu,$ $\tilde B_\mu=\frac{{1}{{4}(1-I\gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$, which amount to eight degrees of freedom (df); isospin  $V-A$ vectors $W_\mu^i=I_i \tilde B_\mu$ with twelve df; also left and right-handed antisymmetric tensors and scalars $n_{{L,R}$, $v_{{L,R}$ in an isospin doublet, amounting to eight df, and with their antiparticles sixteen df. These add up to thirty-six bosons. We  also obtain spin-1/2 left-handed particles in an isospin doublet $(\nu,l^-)_L$ with $Y=-1$ and a right-handed isospin singlet  $l_R^-$ with $Y=-2$; for example \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{lR} l^-_{{R}(k)= \frac{{1}{{8} (1+I \gamma _5 ) ( J \gamma_2-i K\gamma_2) \gamma_0 (\gamma_1+ i I \gamma_2) \end {{eqnarray}  is a right-handed spin component with these quantum numbers and given flavor. Taking account of antiparticles and the two flavors, we have twenty-four fermion df.  The reason for not having altogether sixty-four active df is the four inert df, defining   the flavor, projected by $1-L$,  and  which are not connected to  the Hamiltonian (top-left matrix on Table \ref{{tab:tablejb}).     \renewcommand{{\arraystretch}{{3.5} \begin{{table}[h] \center{{ \begin{{tabular}{{|c|c|c|c|} \hline    & $ {{\Large e^+_L} $ & $\  \ \ \bar\nu_ {{R} \ \ \ $  & $l^+_R$    \\ \hline \ \ \ \ $e^-_R$\ \ \ \ & $\ \ \ \tilde B_{{\mu} \ \ \   $  & $\tilde n_R$ & $\tilde v_R$  \\ \hline $ \nu_L$   & $ \ \ \ n_L$\ \ \ & $B_{{ \mu},\ W^0_\mu$ & $W^1_\mu ,\   W^2_\mu$  \\ \hline  $l^-_L$     & $v_L$ & $W^1_\mu ,\   W^2_\mu$   & $B_{{\mu},\   W^0_\mu$ \\ \hline \end{{tabular}} \caption{{\label{{tab:tablejb} Arrangement of solutions in a $6-d$ $8\times 8$ matrix model, with each box occupying a $2\times 2 $ matrix.} \end{{table} \renewcommand{{\arraystretch}{{1} \normalsize   In seeking a massive extension of Eq. \ref{{geneqIII}, we expect all the hermitian combinations of the  scalar terms $M_i\gamma_0$  to be scalars with respect to   $J_{{\mu\nu}^\prime$. However, if we also demand that they be scalars  with respect to $ J_{{\mu\nu}^L,$ then the choices are reduced to $M_1 = (M/2) (1-I)$,   $M_2 =  i(M/2) (\gamma_5-I \gamma_5)$,  $M_3=-( M /2)J\gamma_2  (1+\gamma_5)$,   $M_4 =  (M/2 )K\gamma_2  (1+\gamma_5)$,   where $M$ is the mass constant. Now, the only non-trivial scalar that commutes with   all  $M_i\gamma_0$ terms is $L$. Nevertheless, if we relax this condition we obtain in addition that  only \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{charge} Q=I_3+\frac{{1}{{2} Y \end{{eqnarray} commutes with $M_3\gamma_0$ and $M_4\gamma_0$. As $Q$ is the electric charge we deduce the electromagnetic $U(1)_{{em}$ remains a symmetry while the hypercharge and isospin  are broken. We stress that   $Q$ is deduced, rather than being imposed, as the only  additional symmetry consistent with massive terms. %$M_3$ and $M_4$ do not %commute among themselves, but rather, can be obtained from each other through %a  unitary transformation involving $\gamma_5$.   \section{{ Interactive field theory and physical fields} We argue below that an interactive field theory can be constructed for fields belonging to an extended spin space. Although we refer to 5+1 $d$, this applies to other dimensions as well. As in Section 5, the spin-space dimension determines the representations, and we shall also  find constraints on their possible interactions.    The expression for the  kinetic-component  Lagrangian density   of a non-abelian gauge-invariant vector field \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{kineLagra}   {{ \mathcal L}_{{V}= -\frac{{1}{{4}F_{{\mu\lambda}^ag^{{\lambda\eta}\delta_{{ab} F^{{b\mu}_{{\ \  \eta}=-\frac{{1}{{4 N_o}tr {{ \mathcal P}_{{D} F_{{\mu\lambda}^a\gamma_0\gamma^{{\lambda} G_a F^{{b\mu}_{{\ \ \eta}\gamma_0\gamma_ \eta G_b \end{{eqnarray}  shows ${{\mathcal   L}_{{V}$ is equivalent to a trace over combinations over normalized components $\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{ N_o}}\gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_a, $ $\mu=0,...3,$ with coefficients $F^a_{{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu A_\nu^a- \partial_\nu^a A_\mu^a+ g A_\mu^b A_\nu^c C^a_{{bc}$, $g$ the coupling constant,   $C^a_{{bc}$ the structure constants, and ${{ \mathcal P}_{{D}$ a Lorentz-scalar projection operator, defining the solution space and Poincar\'e algebra in 5+1 $d$. Limited choices exist for ${{ \mathcal P}_{{D}$, and the restrictions in Section 5 imply ${{ \mathcal P}_{{D}=L$, so,  {{\it e. g.}, $G_a=I_a $  are $8\times 8$ matrices,   and $N_o g^\mu_{{\ \nu}\delta_{{ab}=tr\gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_a \gamma_0\gamma_\nu G_b=g^\mu_{{\ \nu}trG_a G_b $, where for non-abelian irreducible representations we use $trG_i G_j=2 \delta_{{ij}$.      Similarly,   the interactive part of the fermion gauge-invariant Lagrangian %==\slash\!\!\!\!A \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{inteLagra}   {{\mathcal   L}_{{f}=\frac{{1}{{2}{{\psi^\alpha}^\dagger\gamma_0( i\stackrel{{\leftrightarrow}\partial_\mu-g A^a_\mu G_a )\gamma^\mu\psi^\alpha, \end{{eqnarray}  with $\psi^\alpha$  a  massless spinor with flavor $\alpha$, can be written \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{inteLagratra}     {{\mathcal   L}_{{int} = -g\frac{{1}{{ 2 N_o} tr L A_{{\mu}^a \gamma_0\gamma^\mu G_a j^{{b\alpha}_\lambda \gamma_0\gamma_\lambda G_b,\end{{eqnarray} with  $ j_\mu^{{a\alpha}=tr{{\Psi^\alpha}^\dagger\gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_a \Psi^\alpha$  containing $\Psi^\alpha=\psi^\alpha\langle \alpha |$, and $\langle \alpha|$  is a row  state accounting for the flavor. Similar matches between standard Lagrangians  and  their expressions in terms of fields in an extended spin space  for components with scalar fields, and their  interaction with the vector and spin-1/2 fields,  are  considered below.  ${{\mathcal   L}_{{int}$ presents $A^a_\mu$ and $j^a_\mu$  as components over $\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{ N_o}}\gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_a, $  that is, the vector field and the current occupy   the same spin space. This connection and the quantum field theory (QFT) understanding of this vertex as the transition operator between fermion states, exerted by a vector particle, with the coupling constant as a measure of the  transition probability,  justifies the  interpretation  for it $\frac{{1}{{2}g A^{{a\mu} j^{{a\alpha}_\mu= A^{{a\mu}\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{ N_o}} tr{{\Psi^\alpha}^\dagger \gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_a\Psi^\alpha$, leading to the  identification $g\rightarrow 2\sqrt{{ \frac{{K}{{ N_o}}$, $K$ correcting for  over-counted  reducible representations, which need not be considered at 5+1 $d$. The theoretical assignment of $g$ complements QFT, in which the coupling constant  is set  experimentally.   It should be also understood as tree-level information, while the values  are modified by the presence of a virtual cloud of fields, at given energy. Although in QFT the coupling constant  is obtained  perturbatively in terms of powers of  the bare, which takes  infinite values  absorbed through renormalization,  we may take the view that renormalization is a calculational device and that its physical value  is a manifestation of the bare one;  this is feasible for  small  coupling constants,  which  can give  small corrections. Energy corrections are also necessary for a more detailed calculation.    We  found in Section 5 that among a limited number of choices, at 5+1, $L$ reproduces  SM input. In this section's approach, it restricts the possible gauge symmetries and representations,  for $ \gamma_0\gamma_\mu G_i$ needs to be contained in  the space it projects. Thus, it determines the symmetries,    which are global, and  in turn,  the  allowed gauge interactions. Furthermore, it  fixes the representations. In the same vein,  it restricts the allowed Lagrangians.  Fixing $L$, the   physically feasible ($trG_i G_j=2 \delta_{{ij}$) gauge groups are comprised$\cite{{Weinbergbook}$ of the $U(1)$ and compact simple algebras generated in it.  With the conditions of  renormalizability (this excludes antisymmetric fields),  and $L$ conservation, the allowed Lagrangian reduces basically to that of the electroweak sector of the SM, with representations as on Table \ref{{tab:tablejb}.  %\ref{{tab:tablejbFBV})     % CHECK THIS STATEMENT These symmetries turn out to be %trivial when considering Dirac's equation (\ref {{Diraceq}), but they are not when %applied in the sense of Eq.  \section{{ Boson fields after spontaneous symmetry breaking and their masses }  Information on SM  fields and their masses is next derived from the polarization and generator  components of the 5+1 $d$ spin solutions and their  expectation values under  mass operators and then, in relation to the SM.  These values' scalar nature must be  ensured in order to describe mass. %consider quadratic Klein-Gordon mass terms.    In  the SM,  quadratic terms of the form $\langle  {{ \bar \phi} |F^\dagger F |{{ \bar\phi} \rangle$, where $\bar\phi$ is a scalar-particle field (and eventually, a vacuum expectation value), give masses to the boson fields $F$. A similar scalar-expectation value  for bosons is implemented using Eq. \ref{{pointproduct}  by \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{ratioM} M_F^2=tr [ \tilde H,F]^\dagger_\pm [\tilde H,F]_\pm, \end{{eqnarray} where $\tilde H$ is constructed with  the  scalar-chargeless solutions of $n_{{L,R}$, which are the counterpart of the Higgs particle in the SM. Indeed, these terms' components $\tilde n_0=\frac{{1}{{4 \sqrt{{2}}(1+I\gamma_5)(J\gamma_2-i K \gamma_2)\gamma_0=\frac{{i}{{ \sqrt{{2}}\gamma_0 I_+$, $ n_0=\frac{{i}{{ \sqrt{{2}}\gamma_0I_-$, $I_\pm=I_1\pm iI_2$, from Eqs. \ref{{iso}-\ref{{isolast},   form the parity-conserving scalar combinations $M_i\gamma_0$, $i=3,4.$ Specifically, \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{ratioMvscale} \tilde  H= v^\prime \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}(n_0+i \bar n_0) \end{{eqnarray}  with $v^\prime$  an energy scale, is symmetric in particle and antiparticle $n_0$, $\bar n_0$ components and we justify  the coefficients' choice below. Covariance requires  the use of anticommutators   for the spatial vector components, leading to the same scalar quantity, hence the $\pm$ index in Eq. \ref{{ratioM}. When applying this equation to the  scalar fields  both methods give the same result.   We note   that  $M_i\gamma_0,$ $i=3,4,$ by construction, immediately give  $[n_0 , Q ] =[\bar n_0 , Q ]=0$. Thus, the term $A_\mu=\frac{{1}{{2}Q\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$ has quantum numbers of a massless vector and induces the  fermion vertex that identifies it with a photon.  %Satisfying %coincidences as the on standard model. obtained yet search for %fitting. dynamically or otherwise generated term acting on the %bosons.   There are two additional neutral combinations of vector bosons orthogonal to $Q$. One, the axial combination $Z_\mu$ can be related to its namesake in the SM. Indeed, $A_\mu$ can be represented as a mixture of two chargeless and massless components.  On the  one hand,  the $B_\mu$  and  $\tilde B_{{\mu}$ terms form $B_{{Y\mu}   =\frac{{1}{{2\sqrt{{3}}Y \gamma_0\gamma_\mu$ ($B_{{Y0} =g^\prime \frac{{1}{{2}Y$),  that is, the hypercharge carriers.  Thus, we obtain another  argument   to set $Y$ whose origin is  in the way we arrive at the expression for $Q$ in Eq. \ref{{charge}. With hindsight, we write in parenthesis  the $B_{{Y0}$ component, and other fields' below, more generally in terms of a hypercharge coupling constant $g^\prime$ which encompasses  both the arbitrary parameter and normalized-linked interpretations. %We note that in this field the twoto %different quantum numbers which characterize the interaction with % the different chiral fermion components %imply different occupation probabilities for the two field helicities. %CHECK WHETHER % A  VECTOR HELICITY IS REALLY RELATED TO FERMION HELICITY. On the other hand, we can use the chargeless vector isospin triplet component $W_\mu^3=  I_3\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$ ($W_0^3=  gI_3$), $g$ the $SU(2)$ coupling. %CHECK NOTATION From the expressions for $Q$, $A_\mu$, and  $W_\mu^3$  we easily obtain \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Weinangle} A_\mu=\frac{{1}{{2}W_\mu^3+\frac{{\sqrt{{3}}{{2}B_{{Y\mu}. \end{{eqnarray} The value of Weinberg's angle $\theta_W$  is derived  immediately from this equation by making an analogy with the  combination of fields obtained in the  SM, after application of the Higgs mechanism\cite{{Weinberg}. The photon there has the form \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{photon}   \bar A_\mu=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{g^2+g^{{\prime 2}}}(g\bar B_{{Y\mu}+g^\prime \bar   W^0_\mu),   \end{{eqnarray} where the bar denotes here and below SM fields. We obtain $\frac{{g^\prime}{{g} =\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{3}}$. As in the SM $tan(\theta_W)=\frac{{g^\prime}{{g}$, we find $sin^2(\theta_W)=.25$ . We derive the other possible combination constructed with this form: \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Zform} Z_\mu=\frac{{\sqrt{{3}}{{2}W_\mu^3-\frac{{1}{{2}B_{{Y\mu} \end{{eqnarray} ($Z_0=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{{{g}^2 +{{g^\prime}^2}}({{g^\prime}^2 \frac{{1}{{2}Y-g^2 I_3)$).     To calculate $M_F$ in Eq. \ref{{ratioM}  for the vector bosons   we may use  the underlying isospin and hypercharge $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ classification of the generators. It gives $[\tilde n_0,Z_0]=\frac{{1}{{2}\sqrt{{{{g}^2 +{{g^\prime}^2}\tilde n_0$, $[ n_0,Z_0]=-\frac{{1}{{2}\sqrt{{{{g}^2 +{{g^\prime}^2}  n_0$. For the charged vectors, $[n_0,W_0^+]=\frac{{g}{{\sqrt{{2}} v^+_0$, $[\tilde n_0,W_0^+]=0,$ where $\tilde v_0^-=\frac{{1}{{4 \sqrt{{2}}(1+I\gamma_5)(1+I)\gamma_0$, $  v_0^+=\frac{{1}{{4 \sqrt{{2}}(1-I\gamma_5)(1+I)\gamma_0$  are  charged-scalar components.  The resulting values are presented on Table \ref{{tab:tablejbn}, in terms of the $W^\pm_\mu$ mass. They are compared with SM expressions and values. Remarkably, the calculation reproduces the SM  relation $M_Z/M_W=\sqrt{{1+tan^2(\theta_W)} $, for the derived and  general values of $g$ and $g^\prime$. The additional neutral orthogonal vector and pseudo-vector combination is $Z_\mu^\prime =[\sqrt{{3/2}( L+2  Q )-\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}Z_0]\gamma_0\gamma_\mu$,  and its expectation value $M_F$ in Eq. \ref{{ratioM} gives  $M_{{Z^\prime}=\sqrt{{2} M_Z$.  $M_{{Z^\prime}$ is  unstable under changes of some of the $Z_\mu^\prime$  components\footnote{{$M_F$ is not a constant or minimum upon  variation of these parameters.} ($Z_\mu$, $W_\mu$ are stable) which casts doubt on whether it represents a  physical particle. %\def\baselinestretch{{1.10}  \renewcommand{{\arraystretch}{{1.5} \begin{{table}[h] \center{{ \begin{{tabular}{{|c| c c c c c c |} \hline    & {{$fer$}  & $\nu\ \ \ $ & $A_\mu$ & $W^\pm_\mu$   & $Z_\mu$ & $H$  \\ \hline $\{{tr [ \tilde H,F]^\dagger_\pm [\tilde H,F]_\pm\}^{{1/2}$ & $M_W    $  & $0   $ & $0$ & $M_W $ & $\sqrt{{4/3}M_W $ & $\sqrt{{2}M_W $  \\  $[$ GeV $]$  & $ 80.4$& $0$ &$0$ & $80.4$ & $92.8$& $113.7$\\ \hline SM   & $-$  & $0$ &$0$ & $M_W$ & $\sqrt{{1+tan^2(\theta_W) }M_W$& $\frac{{2\sqrt{{2\lambda}}{{g}M_W$\\ $[$ GeV $]$     & $-$   & $0$   & $0$ & $80.4$ & $91.2$& $-$\\ \hline \end{{tabular}} \caption{{\label{{tab:tablejbn} Predictions from $M_F$ in Eq. \ref{{ratioM}, based on  the $sin^2(\theta_W)=.25$ result, for masses of massive fermion ($fer$), neutrino ($\nu$), photon ($A_\mu),$ $W$, $Z$, and Higgs ($H$) particles, in terms of $M_W$, as compared to the SM, with numerical values for both cases.} \end{{table} \renewcommand{{\arraystretch}{{1} \normalsize \baselineskip 22pt \vfil\eject \noindent  Application of Eq. \ref{{ratioM} to the state with scalar polarization  $H= \frac{{g}{{\sqrt{{2}}(n_0+\tilde n_0)=-\frac{{1}{{2}M_3\gamma_0$  leads to $[\tilde H,H]=\frac{{g v^\prime }{{2}(-1+i)[ \tilde n_0, n_0]=\frac{{g v^\prime} {{64}(-1+i)[\gamma_0I_+,\gamma_0I_-]=i\frac{{g v^\prime }{{8}(-1+i)(1-I)\gamma_5 $, implying $M_H=\sqrt{{2}M_W$. The choice  $\tilde H$ in Eq. \ref{{ratioMvscale}    gives mass to  the hermitian scalar combinations $M_i \gamma_0$, $i=3,4$ in Eq. \ref{{geneqIII}, and  is stable  ($n_0\pm  \bar n_0$ makes them either massless or unstable).   It is pertinent to compare this value with recent experiments that indicate a Higgs particle exists with a 114-114.5 GeV mass\cite{{higgs}.      It is illustrative to derive the same results   within the SM, by using its equivalence to a formulation in terms of the fields' underlying spin structure. We consider the Lagrangian component that gives masses to the electroweak vector fields after spontaneous symmetry breaking\cite{{Weinberg}: \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Lagramass}  {{ \mathcal L}_{{M}&=&{{\bar v}^\dagger (i  \frac {{g^\prime}{{2}\bar B^\mu+i\frac {{g}{{2}\tau^i \bar  W^{{\mu i} )^\dagger(i  \frac {{g^\prime}{{2}\bar B_\mu+i \frac {{g}{{2}\tau^i \bar  W_\mu^i)\bar v \\ \nonumber &=& [...]^\dagger[i e \bar A_\mu\frac {{1}{{2}(1+\tau^3)+ \frac{{i}{{2\sqrt{{{{g}^2 +{{g^\prime}^2}} \bar Z_\mu({{g^\prime}^2-g^2\tau^3) +i\frac {{g}{{2\sqrt{{2}} \bar W^{{+}_\mu\tau^+ ]\bar v, \end{{eqnarray} where $\tau^i$ are the Pauli matrices, we use Eq.  \ref{{photon}, $\bar Z_\mu=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{g^2+g^{{\prime 2}}}(g^\prime \bar B_\mu-g \bar W^0_\mu)$, $\bar W^\pm_\mu=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}(\bar W_\mu^1\mp i \bar W_\mu^2)$, $\tau^\pm= \tau^1\pm i \tau^2 $, $e=\frac{{g g^\prime }{{\sqrt{{g^2+g^{{\prime 2}}}$ is  the electric charge,  $\bar v= \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}\left( \begin{{array}{{cc}  0\\   v \end{{array} \right)$,  and $v$ the Higgs vacuum expectation value. $g$ and $g^\prime$ can again either represent coupling parameters or specific numbers linked to the polarization normalization. ${{\mathcal L}_{{M}$ can be equivalently written  in terms of the 5+1 $d$ generators \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Lagramassspin}  {{ \mathcal L}_{{M}&=& \frac{{v^2}{{2}tr  [...]^\dagger[i e \bar A_\mu(I_3+\frac {{1}{{2}Y)+ \frac{{i}{{\sqrt{{{{g}^2 +{{g^\prime}^2}} \bar Z_\mu({{g^\prime}^2 \frac{{1}{{2}Y-g^2 I_3) + \\ \nonumber & & i\frac {{g}{{\sqrt{{2}} \bar W^{{+}_\mu I_+  ]\gamma_0\gamma^\mu \tilde H \\ \nonumber & = &\frac{{1}{{2} tr  (...)^\dagger( \bar Z_\mu [\tilde H, Z^\mu]_\pm + \sqrt{{2} \bar W^+_\mu [\tilde H, {{ W}^{{\mu +}]_\pm ), \end{{eqnarray} In the last equality we use a commutator or anticommutator for $\mu=0$ or $\mu=1,2,3$, respectively. Their expectation values give the $M_Z$ and $M_W$ masses as in Eq. \ref{{ratioM}. The SM sets $v^\prime=v$ in $\tilde  H$. Thus, the vector-boson masses can also be interpreted as stemming from a single mass term defined on a spin space.   On the other hand, the Higgs $\bar \rho$ Lagrangian can be similarly written \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{LagraHiggs}  {{ \mathcal  L}_{{H}=\frac{{1}{{2}\partial_\mu\bar \rho\partial^\mu\bar\rho-V\left  [\frac{{(\bar\rho+v)^2}{{2}\right], \end{{eqnarray} with $V[{{\bar\phi}^\dagger \bar \phi]=\mu^2 \bar\phi^\dagger \bar \phi+\lambda (\bar\phi^\dagger \bar\phi)^2$ the potential of the Higgs doublet, $\mu^2< 0.$ In particular, after spontaneous symmetry breaking, the mass term can be written \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{LagraHiggsmass}  {{ \mathcal L}_{{M_H}=-\frac{{1}{{2} 2 \mu^2\bar\rho^2=-\frac{{1}{{2}  tr[...]^\dagger[\tilde H,  H]\bar\rho^2, \end{{eqnarray} with $v^2=-\mu^2/\lambda$. The second equality has been set so that ${{\mathcal L}_{{M}$ in Eq. \ref{{Lagramass}   and ${{ \mathcal  L}_{{M_H}$ in Eq. \ref{{LagraHiggsmass} exhibit the same underlying operator, with   a symmetry  assumed under the exchange of fields occupying the same (spin) space.  Thus, a  unique term is understood to produce masses at tree level, both among the vector and the scalar fields, setting the Higgs  parameter $\mu$.       \section{{ Vector  fermion-current vertices}  The  spin 1/2 components form a charge $q=1$ (from $Q$) massive  Dirac particle $l$ (left-handed part $l_L$)  and a $q=0$ particle $\nu$,  which remains  massless. This is as occurs in the SM for charged leptons   and neutrinos, to be identified respectively with $l^-$ and $\nu$. Assuming the same spin symmetry for the fermion-mass term  implies taking $H l^-=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}[n_0+\tilde n_0,l^-]= \frac{{1}{{2}l^-$, where, {{\it e.g.}, $l^-=\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}(l_R^-+l_L^-)$, $l_R^-$ is given in Eq. \ref{{lR}, $l_L^-= \frac{{1}{{8} (1-I \gamma _5 ) ( 1+I) (\gamma_1+ i I \gamma_2)$, with equivalent results with $\tilde H$ in $tr[...]^\dagger [\tilde H,l^-]$. Although an $M_W$ mass is obtained for the massive leptons, extended  models accounting for quarks\cite{{Jaimenext} will presumably give a similar prediction,   so that a connection to the top-quark mass scale may be at hand.   SM vertices  describing the fermions to the vector-fermion couplings are obtained from the argument  after Eq. \ref{{inteLagratra}. Following it, the  interaction of the $l$, $\nu$, and $W^\pm$ particles can be described through the Lagrangian \begin{{eqnarray} \label{{Lagrangianferver} {{\mathcal{{L}}_{{Wint}&=&\bar W^+_{{\mu} \frac{{g}{{2\sqrt{{2}}[\bar \nu^\dagger(1- \gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma^\mu \bar l_L^-+hc]\\ \nonumber &=&\bar W^+_{{\mu} tr\frac{{g}{{2\sqrt{{2}}[\nu^\dagger(1-I \gamma_5)\gamma_0\gamma^\mu l_L^-+hc] \\ \nonumber &=& \bar W^{{+\mu} tr[\nu^\dagger W^+_\mu l_L^-+hc], \end{{eqnarray} where in the second equality  5+1 spin polarizations matrices  are used, as in  Eq. \ref{{inteLagratra}.   Similar expressions as in the SM can be obtained for the lepton interactions with the $Z_\mu$ particle.   In addition,  the vertices  give information on the coupling constants  $g^\prime$ and  $g$,  which can also be extracted from the normalization constants of  the vector bosons  in Section 5.  $g$ can be obtained from the coupling of   the massive charged vectors  $W_{{\mu}^+$ and the charged current, defined by the neutrino and the charged leptons wave functions, represented in Eq. \ref{{Lagrangianferver}. These are $g=1,$    $g^\prime=1/\sqrt{{3}$. The next Clifford algebra model at 7+1 $d$, reproduces the same results and, under the assumption that $K=1$, one finds a $ \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{2}}$ factor in the coupling obtained from the trace in  Eq. \ref{{pointproduct}, with respect to the lower-dimensional algebra, with  predictions  $g=1/\sqrt{{2}\approx .707$  $g^\prime=1/\sqrt{{6}\approx .408$.  %CHECK if HIGGS Terms don't overpredict. (THEY Mix left-handed and right %handed terms as mass terms). It is a consistency feature of the theory that any these values are in accordance with $\theta_W$.  In addition, these values are to be compared with the experimentally measured ones at energies  of the mass of the $Z_\mu$ particle, which is where the breakdown  of the $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry occurs. These are $g_{{exp}^\prime\approx .36$, $g_{{exp}\approx .65$, and $sin^2(\theta_{{Wexp})\approx .23$\ . Closer numbers are obtained when considering the SM strong sector\cite{{Jaimenext}.   The theory thus presented succeeds in reproducing many aspects of the electroweak sector of the standard model. We conclude that the latter allows for a consistent spin interpretation  that  enriches it with relevant information on the couplings, the representations, and the masses. The close connection between the results hence derived and the physical particles' phenomenology makes plausible the idea that, as with the spin,   the gauge vector and matter fields, and their interactions  originate in the structure of space-time.   {{\bf Acknowledegment}   The author acknowledges support from  DGAPA-UNAM through project IN118600.      \setcounter{{equation}{{0}  %\hskip  \begin{{thebibliography}{{99}  %\bibitem {{Bell} J.

It describes random surfaces embedded in D-dimensional spacetime  with the following action \be\label{{funaction} S =m \cdot A= {{m\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h}\sqrt{{K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}}, \ee where $m$ has dimension of mass, $h_{{ab}$ is the induced metric and $K^{{i}_{{ab}$ is the second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature). \footnote{{In the above theory extrinsic curvature term $alone$ should be considered as fundamental action of the theory. There is no $area$ term in the action and it is not quadratic in extrinsic curvature as it was in previous studies \cite{{polykov,weingarten}.} The action (\ref{{funaction}) is proportional to the length of the surface $ A $. The last property makes the theory very close to the Feynman path integral for point-like relativistic particle because when the surface degenerates into a single world line the action  (\ref{{funaction}) becomes  proportional to the length of the world line \be\label{{limit} S= m ~A_{{xy} ~~ \rightarrow ~~  m~\int^{{Y}_{{X} ds \ee and the functional integral over surfaces naturally transforms into the Feynman path integral for a point-like relativistic particle (see Figure 1). For a string which is stretched between quark-antiquark pair the action is equal to the perimeter of the Wilson loop $S=m(R+T)$, where R is space distance between quarks, therefore at the {{\it classical level string tension is equal to zero}. In the recent articles \cite{{geo,manvelyan} the authors demonstrated that quantum fluctuations generate an area term in the effective action \be\label{{minimum} S_{{eff} = m^{{2}e^{{-{{4\pi \over D-3}} \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h} h^{{ab} \partial_{{a}X^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}, \ee that is, dynamical string tension $m^2 exp{{(-{{4\pi \over D-3})}$.  Our aim now is to introduce fermions and to suggest supersymmetric extension of this model. First we shall consider basic relations in the bosonic case and the corresponding quantization rules of this highly non-linear and higher-derivative theory. We shall introduce Ramond fermions using standard two-dimensional world-sheet spinors. The main difference with the standard superstring theory is that supersymmetry transformation contains higher derivatives\footnote{{The supersymmetric extension of the model which has the action  quadratic in extrinsic curvature form was considered in \cite{{curtright}.}. We shall demonstrate that the absence of conformal anomaly in quantum theory requires that the space-time should be 6-dimensional\footnote{{This may be interesting for little string theory in 6-dimensions\cite{{seiberg}.},~$D_c =6$.  \begin{{figure} \centerline{{\hbox{{\psfig{{figure=action.eps,width=7cm}}} \caption[fig]{{ It is required that the action $A_{{xy}$ should measure the surfaces in terms of length, as it was for the path integral. When a surface degenerates into a single world line we have natural transition to a path integral . } \label{{fig} \end{{figure}  We shall represent the gonihedric action (\ref{{funaction}) in the form \cite{{geo,manvelyan} \begin{{equation}\label{{conaction} S= {{m\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h}\sqrt{{ \left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}}, \end{{equation} here ~$h_{{ab}=\partial_{{a}X_{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}$ ~is the induced metric,~$\Delta(h)= 1/\sqrt{{h}~\partial_{{a}\sqrt{{h}h^{{ab} \partial_{{b} $ ~is Laplace operator and $K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}=\left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}$. The second fundamental form $K$ is defined through the relations: $ K^{{i}_{{ab}n_{{\mu}^{{i}=\partial_{{a}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}- \Gamma^{{c}_{{ab}\partial_{{c}X_{{\mu} \equiv  \nabla_{{a}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}, $ where $n_{{\mu}^{{i}$ are $D-2$ normals and $a,b=1,2; \qquad \mu=0,1,2,...,D-1; \quad i,j=1,2,...,D-2.$  Below we shall consider a model which has the same action (\ref{{conaction}), but now will be treated  as a functional of two independent field variables $X^{{\mu}$ and $h_{{ab}$, that is, we shall consider scalar fields $X^{{\mu}$ in two-dimensional quantum gravity background $h_{{ab}$. First we shall get equation which follows from the variation of the action over coordinates $X^{{\mu}$ \be\label{{massshell} {{\pi \over   \sqrt{{h}~}{{\delta S \over \delta X^{{\mu}} = \triangle (h)~\left(m {{\triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X)^{{2}}} \right) =0. \ee and shall introduce the momentum operator $$P^{{\mu}_{{a}= \partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \Pi^{{\mu} =m {{\triangle (h) X^{{\mu} \over \sqrt{{(\triangle (h) X)^{{2}}}, $$ where $\Pi^{{\mu}$ has the property very similar with the constraint equation for the point-like relativistic particle \be\label{{secondcon} \Pi^{{\mu}\Pi_{{\mu}~ =~ m^{{2}. \ee One should also compute the variation of the action with respect to the metric $h^{{ab}$ \be \delta S = - {{1\over 2\pi} \int \sqrt{{h} T_{{ab} \delta h^{{ab} d^{{2}\zeta =0 \ee with the following result for $T_{{ab}$ \be\label{{tensor} T_{{ab} = \nabla_{{\{{a }\Pi^{{\mu}  ~\nabla_{{b\}} X^{{\mu} ~-~h_{{ab}~h^{{cd} ~ \nabla_{{c}~ \Pi^{{\mu}~\nabla_{{d} X^{{\mu}~=~0, \ee where $\{{a ~~~b\} $ denotes a symmetric sum.  The energy-momentum tensor is traceless $h^{{ab} T_{{ab} =0$ and we have interaction with conformally invariant matter field $X^{{\mu}$. Thus our basic equations are (\ref{{massshell}),(\ref{{secondcon}) and (\ref{{tensor}).   We can fix the conformal gauge $h_{{ab}=\rho\eta_{{ab}$ using reparametrization invariance of the action and to derive it in the form (see (\ref{{conaction})) \be\label{{gaga} \acute{{S} = {{m\over\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2} X \right)^{{2}} ~=~{{1\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta ~\Pi^{{\mu}~\partial^{{2} X^{{\mu}. \ee In this gauge the equation of motion (\ref{{massshell}) should be accompanied by the constraint equations (\ref{{tensor}) where now $$\Pi^{{\mu} = m \frac{{\partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}} {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X \right)^2}}. $$ In the light cone coordinates $\zeta^{{\pm}=\zeta^{{0}\pm\zeta^{{1}$, $\partial_{{\pm}= {{1\over 2}(\partial_{{0} \pm \partial_{{1})$ the constrains (\ref{{tensor}) take the form \beqa\label{{cons9} T_{{++}= {{1\over 2} ~(T_{{00} + T_{{01})= {{1\over 2}(\partial_{{0}\Pi^{{\mu} +\partial_{{1}\Pi^{{\mu}) (\partial_{{0}X^{{\mu} +\partial_{{1}X^{{\mu})= 2~\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu},\nonumber\\ T_{{--}= {{1\over 2} ~(T_{{00} - T_{{01})= {{1\over 2} (\partial_{{0}\Pi^{{\mu} - \partial_{{1}\Pi^{{\mu}) (\partial_{{0}X^{{\mu} - \partial_{{1}X^{{\mu})= 2~\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}, \eeqa with the trace equal to zero: $T_{{+-}=0$. The conservation of the energy momentum tensor takes the form $ \partial_{{-}T_{{++} = \partial_{{+}T_{{--}=0 $ and  requires that its components are analytic $T_{{++}=T_{{++}(\zeta^{{+})$ and anti-analytic $~T_{{--}=T_{{--}(\zeta^{{-})$ functions. Thus our system has infinite number of conserved charges. This residual symmetry can be easily   seen in gauge fixed action (\ref{{gaga}) written in light cone coordinates $ \acute{{S} = {{4m\over\pi} \int \sqrt{{(\partial_{{+}\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu})^{{2}}~ d\zeta^{{+}d\zeta^{{-}, $ it is invariant under the transformations $ \zeta^{{+} = f({{\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}}),~~~\zeta^{{-} = g({{\tilde{{\zeta}^{{-}}) $ where $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary functions. Another important symmetry of the equation (\ref{{massshell}) is the transformation $ \partial^{{2}X^{{\mu} \rightarrow \Omega(\zeta^{{+},\zeta^{{-})~ \partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}, $ where $\Omega(\zeta^{{+},\zeta^{{-})$ is an arbitrary function. Indeed if $\partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}$ is a solution of the equation (\ref{{massshell}), then $\partial^{{2}\Phi^{{\mu} = \Omega(\zeta^{{+},\zeta^{{-})~ \partial^{{2}X^{{\mu} $ is also a solution.   Let us also consider additional conserved currents. If $\delta X^{{\mu}$ is symmetry transformation of the action with only second derivatives of the fields, then the corresponding conserved current is : \beqa J_{{a} = \partial_{{a}\left({{\partial L \over \partial(\partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}) }\right) \delta X^{{\mu} - {{\partial L \over \partial(\partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}) } \partial_{{a}\delta X^{{\mu}. \nonumber \eeqa In our case it is equal to: $ J_{{a} = \partial_{{a}\Pi_{{\mu} \cdot \delta X^{{\mu} - \Pi_{{\mu}  \cdot\partial_{{a}\delta X^{{\mu}. $ The action (\ref{{gaga}) is invariant under the global symmetries $\delta X^{{\mu} =\Lambda^{{\mu\nu}X_{{\nu} + a^{{\mu}$, where $\Lambda^{{\mu\nu}$ is a constant antisymmetric matrix while $a^{{\mu}$ is a constant. The translation invariance of the action (\ref{{gaga}) $\delta_{{a} X^{{\mu} = a^{{\mu}$ results into the conserved momentum current (already appearing in (\ref{{massshell})) \be P^{{\mu}_{{a} = \partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu},~~~~~~~\partial^{{a} P^{{\mu}_{{a} =0,~~~~P^{{\mu} = \int P^{{\mu}_0 d\zeta^1 \ee and Lorentz transformation $\delta_{{\Lambda} X^{{\mu} = \Lambda^{{\mu\nu}X_{{\nu}$ into angular momentum current \be M^{{\mu\nu}_{{a} = X^{{\mu}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\nu} - X^{{\nu}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu} + \Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{a}X^{{\nu} - \Pi^{{\nu}\partial_{{a}X^{{\mu},~~~~~~~\partial^{{a} M^{{\mu\nu}_{{a} =0,~~~~M^{{\mu\nu} = \int M^{{\mu\nu}_0 d\zeta^1 \ee In this set up the conformal transformation $ \zeta^{{+} = f({{\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}}),~~~\zeta^{{-} = g({{\tilde{{\zeta}^{{-}}) $ is defined as $\delta_{{c} X^{{\mu} = u^{{a}\partial_{{a}X^{{\mu}$, where $u^{{0} = f+g,~u^{{1} = f-g $ and the corresponding conserved current is $T_{{ab}$ (\ref{{tensor}). We can now summarize the basic equations, constraints and boundary conditions for closed string in the form: \beqa \partial^{{2}\Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~~~~~~~~ \Pi^{{\mu}= m \frac{{\partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}} {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X_{{\mu}\right)^2}},~~~~~~\Pi^{{2}_{{\mu} =m^2 ,\nonumber\\ T_{{++}= \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}=0,\nonumber~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\ T_{{--}= \partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}=0,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nonumber\\ X^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1}) = X^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1}+2\pi). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \eeqa The general solution of the equation (\ref{{massshell}) can be represented in the form \cite{{lastprep} $$ \Pi^{{\mu} = {{1 \over 2} ~\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R} + {{1 \over 2} ~\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L},~~~~X^{{\mu} = {{1 \over 2}~ X^{{\mu}_{{R} + {{1 \over 2} ~X^{{\mu}_{{L} + {{1\over 2} \int[\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L} + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}]~\Omega d\zeta^+d\zeta^-, $$ where $\Omega(\zeta^+ ,\zeta^-)$ is arbitrary function of $\zeta^+$ and $\zeta^-$. From its definition the momentum density,~~ $ P^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1}) \equiv P^{{\mu}_{{0}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1}) = \partial_{{0}\Pi^{{\mu} $ is conjugate to ~$X^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1})$,~~ therefore $ [X^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{1}), P^{{\nu}(\zeta^{{0},\zeta^{{'1})] = i\eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta(\zeta^{{1} - \zeta^{{'1}) $ and one can deduce that the following commutation relations should hold \beqa [\partial_{{+} X^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta), \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\nu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{'})]= i \pi \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta^{{~'} (\zeta  - \zeta^{{'}),\nonumber\\ ~[\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta), \partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\nu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{'})]= i \pi \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta^{{~'} (\zeta  - \zeta^{{'}), \eeqa with all others equal to zero ~$[\partial_{{\pm} X^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta), \partial_{{\pm}X^{{\nu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{'})]=0$,~~$[\partial_{{\pm} \Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta), \partial_{{\pm}\Pi^{{\nu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{'})]=0$\footnote{{Requiring that commutation relations for the energy-momentum tensor $T_{{++}$ and $T_{{--}$ should form the algebra of the two-dimensional conformal group one can get the same form of basic commutators.}. To make these formulas more transparent to the reader let me use the analogy with the ghosts $c^{{\pm}$ and anti-ghost $b_{{\pm\pm}$ fields (or super-ghorts). The standard Faddeev-Popov action has the form $\int c~\partial_{{\pm} b$ with nonzero anti-commutator only between $c$ and $b$ fields. Making use of these commutators one can get the algebra of constraints \beqa\label{{standardalg} [T_{{++}(\zeta), T_{{++}(\zeta^{{'})]= i \pi(T_{{++}(\zeta) + T_{{++}(\zeta^{{'}))~\delta^{{~'} (\zeta - \zeta^{{'}),~~~~~~~\nonumber\\ ~[T_{{++}(\zeta), P^{{2}_{{+}(\zeta^{{'})]= i \pi P^{{2}_{{+}(\zeta)~\delta^{{~'} (\zeta - \zeta^{{'}),~~~[P^{{2}_{{+}(\zeta), P^{{2}_{{+}(\zeta^{{'})]=0, \eeqa with similar relations for $T_{{--}$ and $P_{{-}$. Here $2P^{{\mu}_{{0} = \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L} + \partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R} = P^{{\mu}_{{+} + P^{{\mu}_{{-}$.  Our aim now is to include fermions. We shall introduce fermions into string theory with extrinsic curvature action using standard two-dimensional world-sheet Majorana spinors \cite{{ramond,neveu,zumino,green,polchinski} \be \Psi^{{\mu}_{{A}(\zeta) \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}(\zeta)\\      \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}(\zeta)      \end{{array} \right), \ee where $\mu$ is a space time vector index, $A=1,2$ is a two-dimensional spinor index. The action is a sum of the bosonic  and fermionic terms \be \acute{{S} = {{m\over\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \{{ \sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2} X^{{\mu}\right)^{{2}} + i~\bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu} \rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} \} \ee where $\bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu} = \Psi^{{+\mu} \rho^{{0}= \Psi^{{T\mu} \rho^{{0}$ and $\rho^{{\alpha}$ are two-dimensional Dirac matrices \be \{{ \rho^{{a},\rho^{{b} \} =-2 \eta^{{a b}. \ee In Majorana basis the $\rho's$ are give by \be \rho^{{0} = \left( \begin{{array}{{cc}      0&-i\\      i&0      \end{{array} \right),~~~~\rho^{{1} = \left( \begin{{array}{{cc}      0&i\\      i&0      \end{{array} \right) \ee and $i\rho^{{\alpha}\partial_{{\alpha}$ is a real operator. The two-dimensional chiral fields are defined as $ \rho^{{3}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm} = \mp \Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm}, $ where $\rho^{{3}=\rho^{{0}\rho^{{1}$, and our field equations can be written in a compact form \be \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}=0 \Leftrightarrow \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}=0, \ee \be \partial_{{-}\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}=0 \Leftrightarrow \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}=0. \ee The symmetry transformation is: \beqa\begin{{array}{{ll}\label{{trans} \delta X^{{\mu} = \bar{{\epsilon}\Psi^{{\mu},\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} \Pi^{{\mu} ~\epsilon, \end{{array} \eeqa where the anti-commuting parameter $\epsilon$ is a two-dimensional spinor \be \epsilon \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \epsilon_{{-}\\      \epsilon_{{+}      \end{{array} \right). \ee and $P^{{\mu}_{{a} =\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}$ is the momentum operator. This transformation does leave the set of field equations \be \partial^{{2}~\Pi^{{\mu}=0 ,~~~~~~~\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}=0 \ee intact. Indeed: \be \rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}\delta\Psi^{{\mu}=\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a} (-i \rho^{{b} \partial_{{b} \Pi^{{\mu} \cdot \epsilon )= -i\rho^{{a}\rho^{{b}\partial_{{a}\partial_{{b}\Pi^{{\mu} \cdot\epsilon= i\partial^{{2} \Pi^{{\mu} \cdot\epsilon =0 \ee \be \partial^{{2} \delta\Pi^{{\mu} = \partial^{{2} \{{ ~{{\eta^{{\mu\nu}- \Pi^{{\mu}\Pi^{{\nu}   \over \sqrt{{(\partial^{{2} X)^{{2}}  } ~\bar{{\epsilon} ~\partial^{{2} \Psi^{{\nu} ~\}=0 \ee and field equations are invariant under transformation (\ref{{trans}).  We should now test whether we have closed supersymmetry  algebra of transformations (\ref{{trans}). The commutator of two supersymmetries on $X^{{\mu}$ is given by \be\label{{susy} [\delta_{{1},\delta_{{2}]X^{{\mu} = \delta_{{1} \bar{{\epsilon}_{{2}\Psi^{{\mu} - \delta_{{2} \bar{{\epsilon}_{{1}\Psi^{{\mu} = \bar{{\epsilon}_{{2} (-i\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}~\epsilon_{{1}) - \bar{{\epsilon}_{{1}(-i\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}~\epsilon_{{2}) = 2i\bar{{\epsilon}_{{1} \rho^{{a}\epsilon_{{2} ~ \partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}, \ee where the relation $\bar{{\epsilon}_{{2} \rho^{{a}\epsilon_{{1}= -\bar{{\epsilon}_{{1} \rho^{{a}\epsilon_{{2}$ has been used. The commutator of two supersymmetries on $\Psi^{{\mu}$ is given by \be\label{{susy1}\begin{{array}{{lrl} \begin{{array}{{l} [\delta_{{1},\delta_{{2}]\Psi^{{\mu} = \delta_{{1} (-i\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}~\epsilon_{{2}) - \delta_{{2}(-i\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}~\epsilon_{{1})= \end{{array}\\\\ \begin{{array}{{r} -i\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a} \{{{{\eta^{{\mu\nu}- \Pi^{{\mu}\Pi^{{\nu}  \over \sqrt{{(\partial^{{2} X)^{{2}}  }~ \bar{{\epsilon}_{{1} ~\partial^{{2} \Psi^{{\nu} \}~\epsilon_{{2} \Leftrightarrow (1\leftrightarrow 2)= \end{{array}\\\\ \begin{{array}{{l} = 2i\bar{{\epsilon}_{{1} \rho^{{b}\epsilon_{{2} ~ \partial_{{b} \{{{{\eta^{{\mu\nu}- \Pi^{{\mu}\Pi^{{\nu}  \over \sqrt{{(\partial^{{2} X)^{{2}}  } ~\partial^{{2} \Psi^{{\nu} \} + i\bar{{\epsilon}_{{1} \rho^{{b}\epsilon_{{2} ~\rho_{{b}~ \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\{{{{\eta^{{\mu\nu}- \Pi^{{\mu}\Pi^{{\nu}  \over \sqrt{{(\partial^{{2} X)^{{2}}  } ~\partial^{{2} \Psi^{{\nu} \} =0. \end{{array} \end{{array} \ee Last two terms are equal to zero on mass shell because of the classical equation $\partial^{{2}\Psi^{{\mu}=0$. The above calculation makes use of the Fierz rearrangement as well as the properties of Majorana spinors.  It is easy to prove that the action is invariant under the transformation of equation (\ref{{trans}). The invariance is achieved without the use of the field equations, \beqa \delta S = \int \{{ \Pi^{{\mu} \partial^{{2}\delta X^{{\mu} + 2i \bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu}\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}\delta\Psi^{{\mu}  \} d^{{2}\zeta = \int \{{ \Pi^{{\mu} \partial^{{2} (\bar{{\epsilon} \Psi^{{\mu}) + 2i \bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu}\rho^{{a}\partial_{{a}(-i\rho^{{b}\partial_{{b} \Pi^{{\mu} \epsilon) \} d^{{2}\zeta \nonumber\\= \int \{{ \partial^{{2} \Pi^{{\mu} (\bar{{\epsilon} \Psi^{{\mu}) + 2 \bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu}\rho^{{a}\rho^{{b} \partial_{{a}\partial_{{b} \Pi^{{\mu} \epsilon) \} d^{{2}\zeta = \int \{{ \partial^{{2} \Pi^{{\mu} ~\bar{{\epsilon} \Psi^{{\mu} - \bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu}\epsilon ~\partial^{{2} \Pi^{{\mu} \} d^{{2}\zeta =0 \eeqa We can use the Noether method to derive conserved supersymmetry current, the current is a spinor \be J_{{a} = {{1\over 2 }\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a} \Psi^{{\mu}\partial_{{\beta}\Pi^{{\mu} \equiv (J_+ ,J_-), \ee here $J_+$ and $J_-$ are two component spinor currents. The current is conserved \be \partial^{{a} J_{{a} ={{1\over 2 }\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a} \partial^{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}~\partial_{{b}\Pi^{{\mu} + {{1\over 2 }\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a} \Psi^{{\mu}\partial^{{a}\partial_{{b}\Pi^{{\mu} =0 \ee and \be \rho^{{a}J_{{a} ={{1\over 2 }\rho^{{a}\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a} \Psi^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}\Pi^{{\mu}=0 \ee because $\rho^{{a}\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a}=0$. In the two-dimensional notations the supercurrent has components: \beqa J_+ = \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu},~~~~~\partial_{{-} J_+ =0,\\ J_- = \Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu},~~~~~\partial_{{+} J_+ =0, \eeqa representing the {{\it generalized Dirac equations} in our case.  Let us summarize the symmetries of the system. They are: translation in the target space $\delta_{{a}$, spacetime rotations $\delta_{{\Lambda}$, fermi-bose transformation $\delta_{{\epsilon}$ and conformal transformations $\delta_{{u}$ \be\label{{symmetries}\begin{{array}{{lll} \delta_{{a}:~~~~~~\begin{{array}{{ll} \delta_{{a}X^{{\mu}=a^{{\mu}& ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~P^{{\mu}_{{a}=\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}\\ \delta_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} =0 \end{{array}\\ \\ \delta_{{\Lambda}:~~~~~~\begin{{array}{{ll} \delta_{{\Lambda}X^{{\mu}=\Lambda^{{\mu\nu}X^{{\nu}& ~~~~~~~M^{{\mu\nu}_{{a} =X^{{\mu}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\nu}-X^{{\nu}\partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}+ \Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{a}X^{{\nu} - \Pi^{{\nu}\partial_{{a}X^{{\mu} + i\Psi^{{\mu}\rho_{{a}\Psi^{{\nu} \\ \delta_{{\Lambda}\Psi^{{\mu} =\Lambda^{{\mu\nu}\Psi^{{\nu} \end{{array}\\ \\ \delta_{{\epsilon}:~~~~~~\begin{{array}{{ll} \delta_{{\epsilon}X^{{\mu}=\bar{{\epsilon}\Psi^{{\mu}& ~~J_{{a} = {{1\over 2 }\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}\Pi^{{\mu}  \\ \delta_{{\epsilon}\Psi^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} \Pi^{{\mu}\cdot\epsilon \end{{array}\\\\ \delta_{{u}:~~~~~~\begin{{array}{{ll} \delta_{{u}X^{{\mu}=u^{{a}\partial_{{a}X^{{\mu}&~~~~~~~T_{{a b} = {{1\over 2 }\partial_{{\{{a}\Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{b\}}X^{{\mu}  + {{i\over 4 }\bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu}\rho_{{\{{a}\partial_{{b\}}\Psi^{{\mu}-trace\\ \delta_{{u}\Psi^{{\mu} = u^{{a}\partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} \end{{array}\\ \end{{array} \ee Now we can clearly see that two world sheet supersymmetry transformations are equivalent to translation $\delta_a$ in (\ref{{symmetries}) \beqa \int_{{0}^{{2\pi} [\delta_{{1},\delta_{{2}]X^{{\mu} d\zeta^1 = 2i\bar{{\epsilon}_{{1} \rho^{{a}\epsilon_{{2} ~ \int_{{0}^{{2\pi} \partial_{{a}\Pi^{{\mu} d\zeta^1 = 2i\bar{{\epsilon}_{{1} \rho^{{0}\epsilon_{{2} ~ \int_{{0}^{{2\pi} \partial_{{0}\Pi^{{\mu} d\zeta^1 = 2i\bar{{\epsilon}_{{1} \rho^{{0}\epsilon_{{2} ~P^{{\mu},\\ \int_{{0}^{{2\pi} [\delta_{{1},\delta_{{2}]\Psi^{{\mu} d\zeta^1 = 0. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \eeqa Normally in standard string theory it is equivalent to a worldsheet conformal transformation.  Defining the conjugate variable for the fermion field as $ P^{{\mu}_{{\psi} = {{\delta S\over \delta\partial_{{0}\Psi^{{\mu}} = \Psi^{{\mu} $ we can get standard anticommutation relations \beqa\begin{{array}{{lll} \{{ \Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm}(\zeta),\Psi^{{\nu}_{{\pm}(\zeta^{{'})\}= \pi \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta(\zeta^{{1} - \zeta^{{'}),\\ \end{{array} \eeqa with all others equal to zero. Making use of these commutators one can get the standard algebra of the two-dimensional conformal group (\ref{{standardalg}), where now \beqa T_{{++}=2\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu} + {{i\over 2 } \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},   \nonumber\\ T_{{--}=2\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}+ {{i\over 2 } \Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}. \eeqa We are able now to compute the anticommutator  of two supercurrents: \beqa \{{ J_{{+}(\zeta),J_{{+}(\zeta^{{'})\} = \{{ \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}(\zeta),\Psi^{{\nu}_{{+}(\zeta^{{'})\}\cdot \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}(\zeta)\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\nu}(\zeta^{{'}) \equiv \pi P^{{2}_{{+}(\zeta)~\delta(\zeta^{{1} - \zeta^{{'}). \eeqa The square of our generalized Dirac operator $J_{{+}=P^{{\mu}_{{+}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} = \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} ~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}$ is not any more equal to the Virasoro operator $T_{{++}= 2 P^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}~+~ (i/2)\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}$, but instead is a square of  space-time translation operator $P^{{\mu}_{{+}$. One can also compute the following commutator \be [T_{{++}(\zeta), J_{{+}(\zeta^{{'})]= i \pi J_{{+}(\zeta)~\delta^{{~'} (\zeta - \zeta^{{'}). \ee  Quantization of this theory is strait forward \cite{{lastprep}. From the equivalent form of the action (\ref{{gaga}) we can deduce the propagator \be\label{{propagator} \langle \Pi^{{\mu}(k)X^{{\nu}(-k)\rangle =\eta^{{\mu\nu}{{i\pi\over k^2}, \ee or in the coordinate form \be <\Pi^{{\mu}(\zeta)X^{{\nu}(\tilde{{\zeta})> = -{{\eta^{{\mu\nu}\over 2} ln (\vert \zeta - \tilde{{\zeta} \vert \mu). \ee Using the fact that there is no correlations between right and left moving modes of the $\Pi$ field and right and left moving modes of the $X$ field we shall get \be\label{{contraction} <\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^-)X^{{\nu}_{{R}(\tilde{{\zeta^-})> = ~-\eta^{{\mu\nu}~ln [( \zeta^{{-} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{-})\mu)],\\ <\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^+)X^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta^+})> = ~ -\eta^{{\mu\nu}~ln [( \zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})\mu)] \ee Now we are in a position to compute the two point correlation function of the energy momentum operator for bosonic coordinates $X,\Pi$ \beqa <T~T^{{boson}_{{++}(\zeta^{{+}) ~T^{{boson}_{{++}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})  >~ =~ {{1\over 4} <T:\dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) \dot{{X}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}): :\dot{{\Pi}^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) \dot{{X}^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}):>~ \nonumber\\ =~{{1\over 4}   <\dot{{\Pi}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) \dot{{X}^{{\nu}_{{L}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) > <\dot{{X}^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) ~\dot{{\Pi}^{{\nu}_{{L} (\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}) > ={{1\over 4} ~{{D \over (\zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})^4}. \eeqa The contribution of the ghosts b-c system  to the central charge remains the same as in the standard bosonic string theory $$ <T~T^{{ghost}_{{++}(\zeta^{{+}) ~T^{{ghost}_{{++}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})  >~ =~ -{{13\over 4} ~{{1 \over (\zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})^4}. $$ The same is true for fermion and super-ghosts $\gamma - \beta$ system \beqa <T~T^{{fermion}_{{++}(\zeta^{{+}) ~T^{{fermion}_{{++}(\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})  >~ &+&~ <T~T^{{super-ghost}_{{++}(\zeta^{{+}) ~T^{{super-ghost}_{{++} (\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})  >~ =~\nonumber\\= {{1\over 16} ~{{D \over (\zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})^4}~&+&~ {{11\over 8} ~{{1 \over (\zeta^{{+} - \tilde{{\zeta}^{{+})^4}. \eeqa therefore the absence of conformal anomaly \be {{D\over 4} ~-~{{13\over 4} ~+~{{D\over 16} ~+~{{11\over 8}~=0 \ee requires that the space-time should be 6-dimensional \footnote{{We got the same result using mode expansion, the details will be given elsewhere.} \be D_c = 6. \ee This result can be qualitatively understood if one take into account the fact that the field equations here are of the forth order and therefore we have two time more degrees of freedom in the bosonic sector than in the standard string theory. It will be a subject of another paper to investigate the spectrum of this theory in full details.

The spectrum consists of massless states of Rarita-Schwinger fields describing infinite tower of half-integer spins.   %\end{{abstract} %\thispagestyle{{empty} %\end{{titlepage}  \newpage  \pagestyle{{plain} %\pagenumbering{{roman}  \section{{Introduction}  In the recent articles \cite{{gon1,gon3} there was suggested a string theory which is described by the following action: \be\label{{funaction} S =m \cdot L= {{m\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h}\sqrt{{K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}}, \ee here $m$ has dimension of mass, $h_{{ab}$ is the induced metric and $K^{{i}_{{ab}$ is the second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature) \footnote{{This action is essentially different in its geometrical meaning from the action considered in previous studies \cite{{polykov} where it is proportional to the spherical angle and has dimensionless coupling constant.}. Instead of being proportional to the area of the surfaces, as it is the case in the standard string theory, the action (\ref{{funaction}) is proportional to the length of the surface $ L $ \cite{{gon1}. Due to the last property the model has two essentially new properties, first of all, when the surface degenerates into a single world line, the action (\ref{{funaction}) becomes proportional to the length of the world line \be\label{{limit} S= m ~A_{{xy} ~~ \rightarrow ~~  m~\int^{{Y}_{{X} ds \ee and the functional integral over surfaces naturally transforms into the Feynman path integral for a point-like relativistic particle, thus naturally extending it to relativistic strings and, secondly, the action is equal to the perimeter of the Wilson loop $S=m(R+T)$, where R is space distance between quarks, therefore at the {{\it classical level string tension is equal to zero}. Quantization of this system and its massless spectrum have been derived in \cite{{gon3}. In this string theory {{\it all particles, with arbitrary large integer spin, are massless}. This pure massless spectrum is consistent with the tensionless character of the model and it was conjectured in \cite{{gon3} that it may describe unbroken phase of standard string theory  when $ \alpha^{{'} \rightarrow \infty$ and all masses tend to zero $M^{{2}_{{n} = {{1\over \alpha^{{'}}(n-1) \rightarrow 0$ \cite{{gross} .  Our aim now is to introduce fermions   and to suggest supersymmetric extension of this model using world-sheet superfields \cite{{ramond,neveu,zumino,green,polchinski}. The action(\ref{{funaction}) can be written in the equivalent from \cite{{gon1,gon3} \begin{{equation}\label{{conaction} S= {{m\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h}\sqrt{{ \left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}}, \end{{equation} here ~$h_{{ab}=\partial_{{a}X_{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}$ ~is the induced metric,~$\Delta(h)= 1/\sqrt{{h}~\partial_{{a}\sqrt{{h}h^{{ab} \partial_{{b} $ ~is Laplace operator, \footnote{{The equivalence follows from the relation: $K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}=\left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}, \quad i,j=1,2,...,D-2$} $a,b=1,2; \qquad \mu=0,1,2,...,D-1$. We shall fix the conformal gauge $h_{{ab}=\rho\eta_{{ab}$ using the reparametrization invariance of the action (\ref{{conaction}) and represent it in two equivalent forms  \cite{{gon3} \be\label{{gaga} S={{m\over\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2} X \right)^{{2}} ~~\Leftrightarrow~~\acute{{S} = {{1\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta \{{~\Pi^{{\mu}~\partial^{{2} X^{{\mu} - 2 \Omega ~ ( \Pi^{{2} -m^2)~\}, \ee where the independent field $\Pi^{{\mu}$ and the Lagrange multiplier  $\Omega$ have been introduced. The system of equations which follows from $\acute{{S}$ \beqa\label{{orig} \partial^2 \Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~~~~~~ \partial^2 X^{{\mu} - 2\Omega \Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~~~~~~ \Pi^{{\mu}\Pi_{{\mu}~ = m^{{2} \eeqa is equivalent to the original equation for $X^{{\mu}$ and the $\Pi^{{\mu}$ field takes the form $$\Pi^{{\mu} = m \frac{{\partial^{{2}X^{{\mu}} {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X \right)^2}}. $$ Both forms of the action (\ref{{gaga}) can be extended to the supersymmetric case as follows.  \section{{N=1 World-sheet Supersymmetry} For the basic fields~$(X,\Pi,\Omega)$ in (\ref{{gaga}) we shall introduce the corresponding superfields \cite{{zumino,green,polchinski} \beqa \hat{{X}^{{\mu} &=& X^{{\mu} + \bar{{\vartheta} \Psi^{{\mu}+ {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta F^{{\mu}\nonumber\\ \hat{{\Pi}^{{\mu} &=& \Pi^{{\mu} + \bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu}+ {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \Phi^{{\mu}\nonumber\\ \hat{{\Omega}  &=&  \omega  + \bar{{\vartheta} \xi + {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \Omega , \eeqa where $\vartheta$ is an anti-commuting variable and shall define the supersymmetric action simply exchanging basic fields ~$(X,\Pi,\Omega)$ in (\ref{{gaga}) by corresponding superfields as follows \be\label{{firstordsusy} S = {{-i \over 2\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta d^{{2} \theta \{{ ~\hat{{\Pi}^{{\mu} \bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu} - 2\hat{{\Omega} ( \hat{{\Pi}^{{2} -m^2)~\}, \ee where \be D_A = {{ \partial \over \partial \bar{{\vartheta}^A} - i (\rho^{{a} \vartheta)_A \partial_{{a},~~~~ \Psi^{{\mu}_{{A}(\zeta) \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}(\zeta)\\      \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}(\zeta)      \end{{array} \right),~\eta^{{\mu}_{{A}(\zeta)      \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}(\zeta)\\      \eta^{{\mu}_{{+}(\zeta)      \end{{array} \right),~\xi_{{A}(\zeta)      \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \xi_{{-}(\zeta)\\      \xi_{{+}(\zeta)      \end{{array} \right), \ee $\mu$ is a space-time vector index, $A=1,2$ is a two-dimensional spinor index.  $\bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu} = \Psi^{{+\mu} \rho^{{0}= \Psi^{{T\mu} \rho^{{0}$ and $\rho^{{\alpha}$ are two-dimensional Dirac matrices \be \{{ \rho^{{a},\rho^{{b} \} =-2 \eta^{{a b}. \ee In Majorana basis the $\rho's$ are given by \be \rho^{{0} = \left( \begin{{array}{{cc}      0&-i\\      i&0      \end{{array} \right),~~~~\rho^{{1} = \left( \begin{{array}{{cc}      0&i\\      i&0      \end{{array} \right) \ee and $i\rho^{{\alpha}\partial_{{\alpha}$ is a real operator. The two-dimensional chiral fields are defined as $ \rho^{{3}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm} = \mp \Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm}, $ where $\rho^{{3}=\rho^{{0}\rho^{{1}$. We should compute different expressions involved in the action, \beqa \bar{{D}^{{A} D_A \hat{{X}^{{\mu} = 2 F^{{\mu} + 2i \bar{{\vartheta} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} - \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \partial^2 X^{{\mu}, \nonumber \eeqa thus \beqa \hat{{\Pi}^{{\mu} \bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu} = (\Pi^{{\mu} + \bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu}+ {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \Phi^{{\mu})(2 F^{{\mu} + 2i \bar{{\vartheta} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} - \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \partial^2 X^{{\mu}) \nonumber \eeqa and the quadratic part in $\vartheta$ is equal to \beqa -\bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta ~ \Pi^{{\mu}\partial^2 X^{{\mu} + \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta ~F^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} + 2i \bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu}~\bar{{\vartheta} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}. \nonumber \eeqa The integral over Grassmann variables is defined as $\int d^{{2} \theta \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta = -2i$, therefore \beqa {{-i \over 2} \int d^{{2} \theta \{{ ~-\bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta ~ \Pi^{{\mu}\partial^2 X^{{\mu} + \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta ~F^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} + 2i \bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu}~\bar{{\vartheta} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}~\} \nonumber \eeqa \beqa =\Pi^{{\mu}\partial^2 X^{{\mu} + i\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} -F^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu},\nonumber \eeqa where we have used the relation $$ 2i \bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu}~\bar{{\vartheta} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}= -i \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}. \nonumber $$ Now we have to compute also the second term in the Lagrangian \beqa \hat{{\Omega}  ( \hat{{\Pi}^{{2} -m^2) = \omega (\Pi^2 -m^2) +2 \omega \Pi^{{\mu}\bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu} + \omega(\bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu} \bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu} +\bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta ~\Pi^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu}) \nonumber\\ + \bar{{\vartheta}\xi (\Pi^2 -m^2)  + 2 \bar{{\vartheta}\xi \Pi^{{\mu}\bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu} + {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \Omega (\Pi^2 -m^2) \nonumber \eeqa and to integrate it over Grassmann variables \beqa {{-i \over 2} \int d^{{2} \theta \{{-2\hat{{\Omega}  ( \hat{{\Pi}^{{2} -m^2)\} =\Omega (\Pi^2 -m^2) +  \omega (2\Pi^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} + \bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\eta^{{\mu}) + 2 \Pi^{{\mu}~\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\xi. \nonumber \eeqa The full action is now equal  to the following expression \beqa\label{{fullaction} S = {{1\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~\{{ ~\Pi^{{\mu}\partial^2 X^{{\mu} + i\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} -F^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu}~~\nonumber\\ ~~-\Omega (\Pi^2 -m^2) -  \omega (2\Pi^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} + \bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\eta^{{\mu}) - 2 \Pi^{{\mu}~\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\xi~\}. \eeqa The equations of motion are: \beqa\label{{fullequationa} (I)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\Phi^{{\mu} =0\nonumber\\ \partial^2 \Pi^{{\mu} =0\nonumber\\ i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\eta^{{\mu}=0\nonumber\\ 2 \omega \Pi^{{\mu} + F^{{\mu} =0\nonumber\\ \partial^2 X^{{\mu} - 2\Omega \Pi^{{\mu} -2\omega \Phi^{{\mu} -2\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\xi=0\nonumber\\ i\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} -2\Pi^{{\mu}\xi -2 \omega\eta^{{\mu}=0, \eeqa and the variation over Lagrange multipliers gives constraints \beqa\label{{fullconstrants} (II)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\Pi^2 -m^2 =0\nonumber\\ 2\Pi^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} + \bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\eta^{{\mu}=0\nonumber\\ 2 \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu} =0. \eeqa The SUSY transformation is: \beqa \begin{{array}{{lll}\label{{susy} \delta X^{{\mu} = \bar{{\epsilon}\Psi^{{\mu},\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} X^{{\mu} ~\epsilon  ~+~F^{{\mu}~\epsilon ,\\ \delta F^{{\mu} = -i \bar{{\epsilon} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}, \end{{array} \begin{{array}{{lll} \delta \Pi^{{\mu} = \bar{{\epsilon}\eta^{{\mu},\\ \delta \eta^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} \Pi^{{\mu} ~\epsilon  ~+~\Phi^{{\mu}~\epsilon ,\\ \delta \Phi^{{\mu} = -i \bar{{\epsilon} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\eta^{{\mu},\\ \end{{array} \begin{{array}{{lll} \delta \omega = \bar{{\epsilon}\xi,\\ \delta \xi^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} \omega ~\epsilon  ~+~\Omega~\epsilon ,\\ \delta \Omega = -i \bar{{\epsilon} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\xi, \end{{array} \eeqa where the anti-commuting parameter $\epsilon$ is a two-dimensional spinor \begin{{eqnarray}\epsilon \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \epsilon_{{-}\\      \epsilon_{{+}      \end{{array} \right).\nonumber \end{{eqnarray} The action (\ref{{fullaction}), equations (\ref{{fullequationa}) and the constraints (\ref{{fullconstrants}) completely define the system which exhibits the supersymmetry (\ref{{susy}).  \section{{Fermionic BRST-like symmetry}  As we shall see bellow the action (\ref{{fullaction}) possesses surprisingly new global fermionic symmetry which is similar in many ways to the BRST symmetry. This can be seen in the light-cone coordinates. In the light-cone coordinates the action takes the form \beqa\label{{lagran} S = {{2\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~\{{ - 2\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu} + i\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{-}\psi^{{\mu}_{{+} + i\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{+}\psi^{{\mu}_{{-} - {{1\over 2}F^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu}~~~\nonumber\\ ~~-{{1\over 2}\Omega (\Pi^2 -m^2) -  \omega (\Pi^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} +  i\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}) -i \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\xi_{{-} + i \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\xi_{{+}~\}. \eeqa As one can check in addition to the SUSY transformation (\ref{{susy}) this system is invariant under fermion transformation laws $\delta$ and $\bar{{\delta}$: \beqa \begin{{array}{{llllll}\label{{newsusy} \delta X^{{\mu} = 0,\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} = -2\epsilon_{{+}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu} ,\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}=0,\\ \delta F^{{\mu} =  -2i  \epsilon_{{+}   \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},\\ \delta \Pi^{{\mu} =  i\epsilon_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-},\\ \delta \eta^{{\mu}_{{-} = 0 ,\\ \delta \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} =  - \epsilon_{{+}\Phi^{{\mu}~ ,\\ \delta \Phi^{{\mu} = 0, \end{{array}~~~~~ \begin{{array}{{lll} \bar{{\delta} X^{{\mu} = 0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} = 0,\\ \bar{{\delta }\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}= -2\epsilon_{{-}\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu} ,\\ \bar{{\delta} F^{{\mu} =  2i  \epsilon_{{-}   \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-},\\ \bar{{\delta} \Pi^{{\mu} =  i\epsilon_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+},\\ \bar{{\delta}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-} =  \epsilon_{{-}\Phi^{{\mu}~ ,\\ \bar{{\delta}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+} = 0 ,\\ \bar{{\delta} \Phi^{{\mu} = 0, \end{{array}~~~~ \begin{{array}{{lll} \delta \omega =  i\epsilon_{{+}\xi_{{-},\\ \delta \xi_{{-} = 0,\\ \delta \xi_{{+} =  -\epsilon_{{+}\Omega,\\ \delta \Omega = 0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\omega = i\epsilon_{{-}\xi_{{+},\\ \bar{{\delta}\xi_{{-}= \epsilon_{{-}\Omega,\\ \bar{{\delta}\xi_{{+}=0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\Omega= 0, \end{{array} \eeqa The  algebra  obeyed by the fermionic symmetries is nilpotent and is very similar to BRST transformations \be\label{{brst} \delta_{{\epsilon}\delta_{{\acute{{\epsilon}} ~ (H)  = \bar{{\delta}_{{\epsilon}\bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}}~ (H)= 0,~~~~~(\delta_{{\epsilon} \bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}} - \bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}}\delta_{{\epsilon} )~ (H)=0. \ee where H is any of the fields $ (X,\Psi,F,\Pi,\eta,\Phi,\omega,\xi,\Omega)$. The important fact now is that the Lagrangian is a variation of the super-potentials $W$ and $\bar{{W}$ \be W = \Pi^{{\mu}~\partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} + {{1\over 2}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}~F^{{\mu},~~~~~ \bar{{W} =  \Pi^{{\mu}~\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} - {{1\over 2}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}~F^{{\mu}, \ee so that \be \delta W = \epsilon_{{+}{{\cal L},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \bar{{\delta} ~\bar{{W} =\epsilon_{{-}{{\cal L}. \ee It is also true that there exists a potential $V$ such that \beqa \delta ~V= -i\epsilon_{{+} \bar{{W},~~~~  ~\bar{{\delta} ~V =  i \epsilon_{{-} W,~~~~~V= {{1\over 2}\Pi^{{\mu} F^{{\mu}, \eeqa thus $$ i\delta \bar{{\delta}  V = \epsilon_{{+}\epsilon_{{-}{{\cal L}, ~~~~~~~i\bar{{\delta} \delta  V = \epsilon_{{+}\epsilon_{{-}{{\cal L}. $$ The constrains (II) can  also be represented by the $\bar{{\delta} \delta$ transformation and therefore the full Lagrangian in (\ref{{lagran}) can be represented as \be 2\epsilon_{{+}\epsilon_{{-}{{\cal L}_{{tot} = ~i\bar{{\delta} \delta~  \left(  \Pi^{{\mu} F^{{\mu} + \omega (\Pi^2 -m^2)   \right). \ee From (\ref{{brst}) is follows that the action is invariant under fermionic symmetries (\ref{{newsusy}) and can be represented as BRST commutator ${{\cal L} = \{{ Q, W   \}=\{{ \bar{{Q},\bar{{W }  \}$ where $\delta = \epsilon_+ Q, ~\bar{{\delta} = \epsilon_- \bar{{Q} $, as it takes place in topological field theories \cite{{witten}.  \section{{SUSY Solution} As one can see the SUSY solution of equations (\ref{{fullequationa}) is: $$ i) \Omega =\omega  =\xi =0 $$ and the rest of the equations (I) reduce to the following form \beqa (I)~~~~~\partial^2 \Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\eta^{{\mu}=0,~~~ \partial^2 X^{{\mu} =0,~~~ i\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} =0,~~~F^{{\mu}=\Phi^{{\mu}=0 \eeqa and should be accompanied by the constraints \beqa (II)~~~~~\Pi^2 -m^2 =0,~~~~\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\eta^{{\mu}=0,~~~~ \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu} =0. \eeqa In the light-cone coordinates these  equations  are easy to solve since they take the from \beqa \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-} \Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~\partial_{{\pm}\eta^{{\mu}_{{\mp}=0,~~~ \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}  X^{{\mu} =0,~~~ \partial_{{\pm}\psi^{{\mu}_{{\mp} =0,\nonumber\\ \Pi^2 -m^2 =0,~~~~\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-} - \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+} =0~~~~ \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm} =0. \eeqa The mass-shell supersymmetry transformation of the action \beqa \acute{{S} = {{2\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~\{{ - 2\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu} + i\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{-}\psi^{{\mu}_{{+} + i\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{+}\psi^{{\mu}_{{-} ~\} \eeqa is: \beqa\begin{{array}{{ll}\label{{resusy} (III)~~~\delta X^{{\mu} = i\epsilon_{{+}\psi^{{\mu}_{{-} - i\epsilon_{{-}\psi^{{\mu}_{{+},\\ ~~~~~~~~\delta \psi^{{\mu}_{{-} = -2 \epsilon_{{+}\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu}\\ ~~~~~~~~\delta \psi^{{\mu}_{{+} = 2 \epsilon_{{-}\partial_{{+} X^{{\mu} \end{{array} \begin{{array}{{ll} ~~~~~~~~\delta \Pi^{{\mu} = i\epsilon_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-} -i\epsilon_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+},\\ ~~~~~~~~\delta \eta^{{\mu}_{{-} = -2\epsilon_{{+} \partial_{{-} \Pi^{{\mu} \\ ~~~~~~~~\delta \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} = 2\epsilon_{{-} \partial_{{+} \Pi^{{\mu}. \end{{array} \eeqa The solution of fermionic fields can be represented in the form of mode expansion \beqa \eta^{{\mu}_{{+}= \sum c^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{+}},~~~~~ \psi^{{\mu}_{{+}= \sum d^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{+}}\nonumber\\ \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}= \sum \tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{-}},~~~~~ \psi^{{\mu}_{{-}= \sum \tilde{{d}^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{-}} \eeqa and the basic anti-commutators should be defined as: \beqa\begin{{array}{{lll} \{{ \eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm}(\zeta),\psi^{{\nu}_{{\pm}(\zeta^{{'})\}= 2\pi \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta(\zeta - \zeta^{{'}), \end{{array} \eeqa with all others equal to zero $\{{ \eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm}(\zeta),\eta^{{\nu}_{{\pm}(\zeta^{{'})\}= 0,~ \{{ \psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm}(\zeta),\psi^{{\nu}_{{\pm}(\zeta^{{'})\}= 0$. Substituting the mode expansion into the anti-commutators requires following relations between modes \beqa\label{{anticomm} \{{c^{{\mu}_{{n}, d^{{\nu}_{{k}\}= \eta^{{\mu\nu}\delta_{{n+k,0},~~~~ \{{c^{{\mu}_{{n}, c^{{\nu}_{{k}\}= 0,~~~~~\{{d^{{\mu}_{{n}, d^{{\nu}_{{k}\}= 0, \eeqa and similar ones for $\tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{n}$ and $\tilde{{d}^{{\mu}_{{n}$. The commutation relations for bosonic coordinates $X$ and $\Pi$ remain the same as in \cite{{gon3}.  Our aim now is to describe the ground state sector. Let us consider for that the fermion zero mode sector \beqa \{{c^{{\mu}_{{0}, d^{{\nu}_{{0}\}= \eta^{{\mu\nu},~~~~ \{{c^{{\mu}_{{0}, c^{{\nu}_{{0}\}= 0,~~~~~\{{d^{{\mu}_{{0}, d^{{\nu}_{{0}\}= 0,\\ \{{\tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{0}, \tilde{{d}^{{\mu}_{{0}\}= \eta^{{\mu\nu},~~~~ \{{\tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{0}, \tilde{{c}^{{\nu}_{{0}\}= 0,~~~~~\{{\tilde{{d}^{{\mu}_{{0}, \tilde{{d}^{{\nu}_{{0}\}= 0 \eeqa together with the constraint $\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-} - \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+} =0$, which for the ground state takes the form $c^{{\mu}_{{0}\tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{0} - \tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{0}c^{{\mu}_{{0} =0$. The nontrivial solution of the last equations  is: \beqa 2 c^{{\mu}_{{0} &= i\gamma^{{\mu} \grave{{\gamma}^{{D+1} + \grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu},~~~ 2 d^{{\mu}_{{0} = &i\gamma^{{\mu} \grave{{\gamma}^{{D+1} - \grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu} ,~~~\\ 2\tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{0} &= \gamma^{{\mu} + i \gamma^{{D+1} \grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu},~~~ 2\tilde{{d}^{{\mu}_{{0} = &- \gamma^{{\mu} +~~ i \gamma^{{D+1} \grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu} , \eeqa where  $[\gamma^{{\mu},\grave{{\gamma}^{{\nu}] =0$. The matrix $\gamma^{{D+1} \grave{{\gamma}^{{D+1}$ anticommutes  with all these matrices and therefore the nonzero modes should be multiplied by this matrix   to fulfill anticommutation relations between zero modes and nonzero modes. Thus we have the solution for boson \cite{{gon3} and fermion fields in the form \beqa \Pi^{{\mu} &=&   m e^{{\mu} +  k^{{\mu}\tau + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{oscil},~~~ X^{{\mu} =   x^{{\mu} +  {{1\over m}\pi^{{\mu}\tau + X^{{\mu}_{{oscil},\\ \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} &=& c^{{\mu}_{{0} + \eta^{{\mu}_{{+~oscil},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}=  \tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{0} + \eta^{{\mu}_{{-~oscil}, \eeqa where $[e^{{\mu}, \pi^{{\nu}]=[x^{{\mu}, k^{{\nu}] = i\eta^{{\mu\nu}$ is a pair of conjugate variables describing bosonic zero mode sector. The important difference between the standard string theory and the present one is the appearance of conjugate variables $e$ and $\pi$, where $e^{{\mu}$ is a polarization vector orthogonal to the momentum vector $k^{{\mu}$ ( $e^{{\mu} k^{{\mu}=0$ )~\cite{{gon3} . It is convenient to denote the ground state wave function as $|k,e,0>$, so that the  constraint $L_0 \Psi_{{phys} = \{{k \cdot \pi  + oscillators ....\}\Psi_{{phys}=0$, which take place in this theory ( see for details \cite{{gon3}), take the form \be\label{{subsidery} k \cdot \pi |k,e,0>= k \cdot \partial_e |k,e,0> =0. \ee The new constraints $\Pi \cdot\eta_{{\pm}~\Psi_{{phys}=0$, which appear now in supersymmetric case, on the ground state wave function $|k,e,0>$  will take the form \beqa\begin{{array}{{ll} (i\gamma^{{\mu} \grave{{\gamma}^{{D+1} + \grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu})k^{{\mu} |k,e,0>=0\\ (i\gamma^{{\mu} \grave{{\gamma}^{{D+1} + \grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu})e^{{\mu} |k,e,0>=0 \end{{array} \begin{{array}{{ll} (\gamma^{{\mu} + i \gamma^{{D+1} \grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu})k^{{\mu} |k,e,0>=0\\ (\gamma^{{\mu} + i \gamma^{{D+1} \grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu})e^{{\mu}|k,e,0>=0. \end{{array} \eeqa Expanding the ground wave function in $e^{{\mu}$ series \be |k,e,0> = \psi + e^{{\mu} ~\psi^{{\mu} + e^{{\mu_1} e^{{\mu_2}~\psi^{{\mu_1  \mu_2} + ... \ee we shall get Dirac equations on the spin tensor $\psi^{{\mu_1  \mu_2 ... \mu_J}$ \beqa (1+ \gamma^{{D+1} \grave{{\gamma}^{{D+1})\gamma^{{\mu} k^{{\mu}~\psi^{{\mu_1  \mu_2 ... \mu_J} =0\nonumber\\ (1+ \gamma^{{D+1} \grave{{\gamma}^{{D+1})\grave{{\gamma}^{{\mu} k^{{\mu}~\psi^{{\mu_1  \mu_2 ... \mu_J} =0 \eeqa together with the constraint (\ref{{subsidery}) \beqa k^{{\mu_1}~\psi^{{\mu_1  \mu_2 ... \mu_J} =0, \eeqa thus describing massless particles of half-integer spin $J+ 1/2 = 1/2, 3/2, .....$. One should study in great details full Hilbert space of exited states in order to learn more about complete spin content of the theory and to prove the absence of the negative norm states. The details will be given elsewhere.     \newpage \section{{Second Order Formulation} In this section we shall return back to the original action (\ref{{gaga}) with its unique variable $X^{{\mu}$. Using superfield formalism one can extend this form of the action to supersymmetric case as well. We need just one superfield $ \hat{{X}^{{\mu} =X^{{\mu} + \bar{{\vartheta} \Psi^{{\mu}+ {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta F^{{\mu}. $ The worldsheet supersymmecric action can be written in the form \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{secondordsusy} S = -{{im \over 2\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta d^{{2} \theta \sqrt{{(\bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu})^2}. \end{{eqnarray} Let us demonstrate now that classically it defines a model which is equivalent to (\ref{{firstordsusy}). Indeed the superfield equations which follow from (\ref{{firstordsusy}) are: \begin{{eqnarray} \bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu} - 4\hat{{\Omega} \hat{{\Pi}^{{\mu}=0 \nonumber\\ \bar{{D} D \hat{{\Pi}^{{\mu} =0 \nonumber\\ \hat{{\Pi}^2 -m^2 =0 \end{{eqnarray} and one can see that \begin{{eqnarray} \hat{{\Pi}^{{\mu} = {{1\over 4\hat{{\Omega}}\bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu}.\nonumber \end{{eqnarray} From the last equation it follows that \begin{{eqnarray}{{1\over 4\hat{{\Omega}}= {{m\over \sqrt{{(\bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu})^2}} \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} and field equations take the form \begin{{eqnarray}\bar{{D} D \{{ m {{\bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu}\over \sqrt{{(\bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu})^2}}  \}=0. \end{{eqnarray} The last equation simply follows from  (\ref{{secondordsusy}) by direct variation over $\hat{{X}$, thus these models are indeed classically equivalent.  In this formulation we have \begin{{eqnarray} (\bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu})^2 = 4(F^{{\mu}F^{{\mu} + 2i F^{{\mu} \bar{{\vartheta }\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} - \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta ~ F^{{\mu}\partial^2 X^{{\mu} - \bar{{\vartheta }\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} \bar{{\vartheta }\rho^{{b} \partial_{{b}\Psi^{{\mu})\nonumber \end{{eqnarray} so that \begin{{eqnarray} \sqrt{{(\bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu})^2} =  2 \sqrt{{F^{{\mu}F^{{\mu}} \{{~1 - \bar{{\vartheta}\vartheta ~ F^{{\mu}\partial^2 X^{{\mu}/2F^{{2} -(\bar{{\vartheta }\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu})^2/2F^{{2} +\nonumber\\ i \bar{{\vartheta }\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} F^{{\mu} /F^{{2}- (1/8)(2i \bar{{\vartheta }\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} F^{{\mu} /F^{{2})^2 ~\} \nonumber \end{{eqnarray} and \begin{{eqnarray}S ={{m \over \pi} \int d^{{2} \zeta {{1 \over \sqrt{{F^{{2}}} \{{ F^{{\mu}\partial^2 X^{{\mu} + {{1\over 2} \partial_{{a}\bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu}\rho^{{a} K^{{\mu\nu}  \rho^{{b} \partial_{{b}\Psi^{{\nu} \},~~~K^{{\mu\nu}=\eta^{{\mu\nu}-  {{F^{{\mu} F^{{\nu} \over F^2}. \end{{eqnarray} The supersymmetry transformation is: \begin{{eqnarray}\begin{{array}{{ll}\label{{trans} \delta X^{{\mu} = \bar{{\epsilon}\Psi^{{\mu},\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} X^{{\mu} ~\epsilon  ~+~F^{{\mu}~\epsilon ,\\ \delta F^{{\mu} = -i \bar{{\epsilon} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}. \end{{array} \end{{eqnarray} We can write the action  in terms of components in the following form \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{19} S=\frac{{2m}{{\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta \frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{F^{{2}}}\left\{{-2F^{{\mu}\partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu} +i\left[\partial_{{-}\Psi_{{+}^{{\mu}\partial_{{+} \Psi_{{-}^{{\nu} -  \partial_{{+} \Psi_{{-}^{{\mu}\partial_{{-}\Psi_{{+}^{{\nu}\right]K^{{\mu\nu}\right\} \end{{eqnarray} with the following equations of motion for $F^{{\mu},\Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm}$ and $X^{{\mu}$: \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{20} &&K^{{\mu\nu}\partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}X^{{\nu}-\frac{{i}{{2}\left[\partial_{{+} \Psi_{{-}^{{\nu}\partial_{{-}\Psi_{{+}^{{\lambda}-\partial_{{-} \Psi_{{+}^{{\nu}\partial_{{+}\Psi_{{-}^{{\lambda}\right] \frac{{F_{{\{{\mu}K_{{\nu\lambda\}}}{{F^{{2}}=0,\\ &&\partial_{{\pm}\left[\frac{{1}{{\sqrt{{F^{{2}}}K_{{\mu\nu}\partial_{{\mp} \Psi^{{\nu}_{{\pm}\right]=0, \label{{21}\\ &&\partial^{{2}\left(\frac{{F^{{\mu}}{{\sqrt{{F^{{2}}}\right)=0\label{{22}, \end{{eqnarray} where $\{{\mu\nu\lambda\}=\mu\nu\lambda+ \rm{{cycl. perm.}$. Solving Eq. (\ref{{21}) and using (\ref{{20}) we shall get the following solution and constraints for fermions \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{23}   &&\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}(\zeta^{{+},\zeta^{{-})=\psi^{{\mu}_{{+}(\zeta^{{+})+   \int^{{\zeta^{{-}}_{{0}   d\tilde{{\zeta}^{{-}\left(\frac{{1}{{m}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}(\tilde{{\zeta^{{-}}) \Lambda(\zeta^{{+}\tilde{{\zeta^{{-}})-\frac{{1}{{2}\Pi^{{\mu}(\zeta^{{+}\tilde{{\zeta^{{+}}) \xi_{{-}(\zeta^{{+}\tilde{{\zeta^{{-}})\right)\qquad\\ &&\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}(\zeta^{{+},\zeta^{{-})=\psi^{{\mu}_{{-}(\zeta^{{-})+ \int^{{\zeta^{{+}}_{{0} d\tilde{{\zeta}^{{+}\left(\frac{{1}{{m}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}(\tilde{{\zeta^{{+}}) \Lambda(\tilde{{\zeta^{{+}}\zeta^{{-})-\frac{{1}{{2}\Pi^{{\mu}(\tilde{{\zeta^{{+}}\ zeta^{{+})\xi_{{+}(\tilde{{\zeta^{{+}}\zeta^{{-})\right)\qquad\\ &&\Pi^{{\mu}\eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm}=0,\qquad \eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}-\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}=0 \label{{24} \end{{eqnarray} where we have introduced instead of vector  $F^{{\mu}$ the normalized variable $\Pi^{{\mu}=m\frac{{F^{{\mu}}{{\sqrt{{F^2}}$ and scalar variable $\Lambda=\sqrt{{F^{{2}}$ corresponding to the length of $F^{{\mu}$. The remaining equations in the bosonic sector are the same as in the ``first'' order formalism  described in the previous sections \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{25}   &&\partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}=0,\qquad \Pi^{{2} - m^2=0,\\ &&\partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}+\frac{{1}{{2}\Omega\Pi^{{\mu} +\frac{{i}{{2}\left(\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\xi_{{-}-\eta_{{-}\xi_{{+}\right)=0. \end{{eqnarray} From the action (\ref{{19}) we can derive the canonical momenta for  fermionic fields \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{momenta} P_{{\Psi_{{-}}^{{\mu}=\frac{{\overrightarrow{{\delta} L}{{\delta \partial_{{0}\Psi_{{-}^{{\mu}}=-\frac{{2m}{{\pi\sqrt{{F^{{2}}}K_{{\mu\nu}\partial_{{- }\Psi_{{+}\\ P_{{\Psi_{{+}}^{{\mu}=\frac{{\overleftarrow{{\delta} L}{{\delta \partial_{{0}\Psi_{{+}^{{\mu}}=-\frac{{2m}{{\pi\sqrt{{F^{{2}}}K_{{\mu\nu}\partial_{{+ }\Psi_{{-} \end{{eqnarray} Using solutions (\ref{{23}) and (\ref{{24}) we can  see that these momenta are equal to $\eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm}$,  and anti-commutators between $\eta$ and $\psi$ coincide with anti-commutation relations (\ref{{anticomm}) of the previous section.  The advantage of the last formalism is that it has less fields and therefore some hidden symmetries of the model  are much easier to detect. In particular, it is much easier to observe a surprising property of the action (\ref{{19}), that it is BRST exact and might be related to the topological nature of this supersymmetric extension. More precisely we can define the following set of nilpotent Grassmann odd  symmetries related with some part of supersymmetry transformations \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{36} &&{{\bf S}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}=\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}, \qquad {{\bf S}X^{{\mu}=0,\nonumber\\ &&{{\bf S}F^{{\mu}=-i\partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}, \qquad {{\bf S}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}=0,\label{{37}\nonumber\\ &&{{\mathbf S}^{{2}=0\label{{38} \end{{eqnarray} or the similar in left moving sector \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{39} &&{{\bf \bar{{S}}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}=\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}, \qquad {{\bf \bar{{S}}X^{{\mu}=0,\nonumber\\ &&{{\bf \bar{{S}}F^{{\mu}=i \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}, \qquad {{\bf \bar{{S}}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}=0,\label{{40}\nonumber\\ &&{{\bf \bar{{S}}^{{2}=0\label{{41} \end{{eqnarray} The action (\ref{{19}) can be expressed in the BRST exact form \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{42} S=\frac{{-4m}{{\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta {{\bf S} W= \frac{{-4m}{{\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta{{\bf \bar{{S}} \bar{{W} ,\end{{eqnarray} where we have introduced so called gauge fermions \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{43} W= \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}\frac{{F^{{\mu}}{{\sqrt{{F^{{2}}},~~~~~~~~~~~ \bar{{W}= \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}\frac{{F^{{\mu}}{{\sqrt{{F^{{2}}}. \end{{eqnarray} Then we can observe that these two nilpotent symmetries anticomute \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{44} \left\{{{{\mathbf S},{{\bf \bar{{S}}\right\}=0 \end{{eqnarray} and we can express our two gauge fermions in term of one gauge boson and generators of the second symmetry \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{45} W= {{\bf \bar{{S}}\sqrt{{F^{{2}},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \bar{{W}=-{{\mathbf S}\sqrt{{F^{{2}},\\ S=\frac{{-4m}{{\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta~ {{\bf S}{{\bf\bar{{S}}~\sqrt{{F^{{2}}.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \end{{eqnarray} So we can deduce that the action (\ref{{19}) is BRST and anti-BRST exact and somehow is equivalent to the sum of gauge fixing term and Faddeev-Popov determinant for some  gauge transformation of our fields (may be in this case nonlocal).  One can formally express the partition function in terms of singular determinant, if for a moment ignor its zero modes. Indeed, integrating in Z \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{46}   Z=\int \exp\left[iS\right] DF^{{\mu}D\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}D\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}D\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} \end{{eqnarray} over $\Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm}$ and $X^{{\mu}$ we shall get the following expression \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{47}   Z=\int \det\left[\partial_{{-}\frac{{\delta \Pi^{{\mu}}{{\delta   F^{{\mu}}\partial_{{+}\right]   \delta\left(\partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}\right)DF^{{\mu}, \end{{eqnarray} where $\Pi^{{\mu}=\frac{{F^{{\mu}}{{\sqrt{{F^{{2}}}$ and $\frac{{\delta \Pi^{{\mu}}{{\delta   F^{{\nu}}=\frac{{K^{{\mu\nu}}{{\sqrt{{F^{{2}}}$. It is clear that if one changes the integration variable $F^{{\mu}$ to a unit length function $\Pi^{{\mu}$ then two determinants will cancel each other and the partition function Z will be equal to one. But we have to notice that this transformation is degenerate because the corresponding Jacobian $\frac{{\delta \Pi^{{\mu}}{{\delta F^{{\mu}}$ is proportional to the projector $K^{{\mu\nu}$ and therefore one should properly account its zero modes.  As usually in the case of BRST exact actions \cite{{witten}, we can construct  observables. For any form $A=A\left(F\right)_{{\mu_{{1}....\mu_{{n}}dF^{{\mu_{{1}}\wedge....\wedge dF^{{\mu_{{n}}$ we can define  the corresponding operator ${{\cal O}_{{A}$ replacing $dF^{{\mu_{{i}}$ by the BRST  exact operator $\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu_{{i}}_{{+}$ \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{48} {{\cal O}_{{A}=A\left(F \right)_{{\mu_{{1}....\mu_{{n}}\partial_{{-} \Psi^{{\mu_{{1}}_{{+}~...~\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu_{{n}}_{{+}. \end{{eqnarray} From (\ref{{36}) it follows that \begin{{eqnarray}\label{{49} &&i\bar{{S}{{\cal O}_{{A}= {{\partial A_{{\mu_{{1}....\mu_{{n}}  \over \partial F^{{\mu_{{0}} } ~~\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu_{{0}}_{{+}~\partial_{{-} \Psi^{{\mu_{{1}}_{{+}~...~\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu_{{n}}_{{+}\\ &&i\bar{{S}{{\cal O}_{{A}={{\cal O}_{{dA} \end{{eqnarray} where $dA$ is the exterior derivative of A. Thus closed forms $dA =0$ induce BRST invariant operators ${{\cal O}_A$ and de Rham cohomology classes of forms transform to the BRST cohomology classes, and we have at our disposal a set of nontrivial invariant observables \cite{{witten}.    \begin{{thebibliography}{{99} \bibitem{{gon1}G.K.Savvidy and K.G.Savvidy, Mod.Phys.Lett.

Naive identification of standard string theory spectrum with hadronic spectrum encounters a number of conceptual problems connected with the appearance of massless states containing graviton in the string spectrum, soft behavior of high energy scattering amplitudes, opposite to what one should expect in parton-like picture of asymptotically free gauge theories and, not the least, higher dimensional space-time.\\  Essential progress was achieved in \cite{{Maldacena:1997re,Gubser:1998bc,Witten:1998qj,Aharony:1999ti} where the AdS/CFT correspondence was proposed relating the classical supergravity approximation $R^{{2}_{{AdS}/\alpha' \gg 1$ of closed IIB  strings moving on ten-dimensional curved space-time background  $AdS_5 \times S^5$ with large t'Hooft coupling regime of ${{\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory $R^{{4}_{{AdS}/\alpha'^{{2} = \lambda  \equiv  g^{{2}_{{YM}N$. In this duality map one side is weakly coupled, the other is strongly coupled and there is a natural prescription relating physical quantities in string and gauge theories, in particular, identifying  stringy states corresponding to the leading Regge trajectory with highly excited gauge theory operators \cite{{Polyakov:2001af, Berenstein:2002jq,Gubser:2002tv}. The conjecture was applied to calculate Wilson loops, anomalous dimensions, etc. on the gauge theory side at strong coupling regime.\\   If one adopts the strong form of the Maldacena conjecture stating that two theories are exactly the same for all values of coupling constants\cite{{Maldacena:1997re}, then it is important to understand what string theory is like in the opposite limit when the gauge theory is in the weak coupling regime \cite{{Haggi-Mani:2000ru,Sundborg:2000wp,Witten:2000,Klebanov:2002ja} . In that regime the string tension $T = 1/2\pi \alpha' = \sqrt{{\lambda}/R^{{2}_{{AdS}$ effectively tends to zero and it is natural to assume that free gauge theory, $\lambda \ll 1$, corresponds to zero tension string theory, that is to the string theory at extreme energies \cite{{gross,Moore:1993ns,Isberg:1993av}. The dual description of weakly interacting gauge theory states on the boundary, in particular, operators with minimal twist, consisting of bilinear high spin tensors, on the $AdS_5$ side are supposed to be expressed in terms of locally interacting massless gauge fields of arbitrarily high spin \cite{{Ferrara:1998jm,Haggi-Mani:2000ru,Sundborg:2000wp, Witten:2000,Vasiliev:1999ba,Sezgin:2001zs,Mikhailov:2002bp,Francia:2002aa}. The gauge theory correlation functions on the boundary define a high spin field theory in the bulk with nontrivial interaction vertices \cite{{Bengtsson:1983pg,Bengtsson:1983pd,Savvidy:1998sb}, and the resulting holographically dual classical gauge field theory would be the effective description of the desirable string theory in the bulk, celebrated symmetric phase of string theory \cite{{gross}.\\   This development initiates a fresh interest to the old problem of tensionless limit of the standard string theory and to the description of its genuine symmetries \cite{{gross,Haggi-Mani:2000ru,Sundborg:2000wp, Isberg:1993av,Savvidy:dv,DeVega:1992tm,Clark:2003wk}. In recent publications we approached this problem formulating tensionless strings by means of geometrical concept of surface perimeter, or its length \cite{{gon1,Savvidy:dv}. The perimeter action uniquely leads to tensionless theory. It was suggested that nonlinear world-sheet sigma model which describes tensionless limit is defined by the following action: \be\label{{funaction} S =m \cdot L=  m \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h}\sqrt{{K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}}, \ee here $m$ has dimension of mass, $h_{{ab}$ is the induced metric and $K^{{i}_{{ab}$ is the second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature) \footnote{{This action is essentially different in its geometrical meaning from the action considered in previous studies \cite{{polykov} where it is proportional to the spherical angle and has dimensionless coupling constant.}. Instead of being proportional to the area of the surfaces, as it is the case in the standard string theory: $$ A  \simeq {{1\over 2\pi \alpha '}\int \sqrt{{1 - V^{{2}_{{\bot}} ~dsdt, $$ the perimeter action (\ref{{funaction}) is proportional to the length of the surface. Due to the last property the model has two desirable features. First of all, when the surface degenerates into a single world line, the perimeter action (\ref{{funaction}) becomes proportional to the length of the world line \cite{{gon1,Savvidy:dv} \be\label{{limit} S ~~\simeq m \int\sqrt{{1 - V^{{2}_{{\bot}}\cdot K(s,t)  ~dsdt  \rightarrow ~~ m~ \int  \sqrt{{1 - V^{{2}_{{\bot}}~2\pi ~dt, \ee where $K(s,t) = d\varphi /ds$ is a string curvature. Thanks to this property the functional integral over surfaces simply transforms into the Feynman path integral for a point-like relativistic particle, naturally extending it to relativistic strings. Secondly, the action is equal to the perimeter of the flat Wilson loop $S=m(R+T)$, where R is space distance between quarks, therefore at the {{\it classical level string tension is equal to zero}. The action(\ref{{funaction}) can be written in the equivalent form \cite{{gon1,Savvidy:dv} \begin{{equation}\label{{conaction} S= {{m\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{h}\sqrt{{ \left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}}, \end{{equation} where ~$h_{{ab}=\partial_{{a}X_{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}$ ~is the induced metric,~$\Delta(h)= 1/\sqrt{{h}~\partial_{{a}\sqrt{{h}h^{{ab} \partial_{{b}$ ~is Laplace operator, \footnote{{The equivalence follows from the relations: $K^{{ia}_{{a} n^{{i}_{{\mu}= \Delta(h) X_{{\mu}$, where $n^{{\mu}_{{i}$  are the normals and $K^{{ia}_{{a}K^{{ib}_{{b}=\left(\Delta(h) X_{{\mu}\right)^{{2}, \quad i,j=1,2,...,D-2$} $a,b=1,2; \quad \mu=0,1,2,...,D-1$.\\  In the present work I shall consider so called model {{\it B} \cite{{Savvidy:dv}, in which two fields $h_{{ab}$- the world-sheet metric and $X^{{\mu}$ - the embedding  field are considered as independent, that is we abandon  the relation ~$h_{{ab}=\partial_{{a}X_{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X_{{\mu}$ ~ between them. At this stage there is no direct relation of the model with embedding into space-time and the model can be considered as two-dimensional quantum gravity interacting with scalar fields $X^{{\mu}$. We shall refer to the original theory, where fields are not independent, as to model {{\it A}. The interrelation between them is considered in \cite{{Savvidy:dv}.\\   We shall fix the conformal gauge $h_{{ab}=\rho\eta_{{ab}$ using the reparametrization invariance of the action (\ref{{conaction}) and represent it in two equivalent forms  \cite{{Savvidy:dv} \be\label{{gaga} S={{m\over\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta \sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2} X \right)^{{2}} ~~\Leftrightarrow~~\acute{{S} = {{1\over\pi}\int d^{{2}\zeta \{{~\Pi^{{\mu}~\partial^{{2} X^{{\mu} -  \Omega ~ ( \Pi^{{2} -m^2)~\}, \ee where we have introduced the independent field $\Pi^{{\mu}$ and the Lagrange multiplier  $\Omega$. The system of equations which follows from $\acute{{S}$ \beqa\label{{orig} (I)~~~~~~~~~~~~\partial^2 \Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~~~~~~ \partial^2 X^{{\mu} - 2\Omega \Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~~~~~~ \Pi^{{\mu}\Pi_{{\mu}~ = m^{{2} \eeqa is equivalent to the original equation for $X^{{\mu}$ which follows from $S$ \be\label{{confequa1} (I')~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\partial^{{2}\left(m \frac{{\partial^{{2}X_{{\mu}} {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X \right)^2}}\right) =0. \ee The $\Pi^{{\mu}$ field has the form $ \Pi^{{\mu} = m  \partial^{{2}X^{{\mu} / \sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X \right)^2}. $ In addition to the reparametrization invariance the system exhibits a new gauge symmetry. For a given parametrization the additional invariance has the form \cite{{Savvidy:dv} $$ \partial^{{2}X^{{\mu} \rightarrow \partial^{{2}X^{{\mu} + 2\omega \Pi^{{\mu} ,~~~\Pi^{{\mu} \rightarrow \Pi^{{\mu},~~~~~\Omega \rightarrow \Omega + \omega $$ where $\omega = \partial_a \omega^a$ and $\omega^a$ is arbitrary vector field on the world-sheet. The above gauge transformation \be\label{{newgauge} \partial^{{2} X^{{'}_{{\mu} = \left(1 +   \frac{{ 2\omega } {{\sqrt{{\left(\partial^{{2}X \right)^2}}\right) ~\partial^{{2} X_{{\mu} \ee defines a set of  fields $X_{{\mu}$ describing the same physics and can be seen as the gauge orbit of this extra symmetry. Notice that fields on a given gauge orbit are not related by reparametrization.  This gauge symmetry renders the  string space-time coordinate $X^{{\mu}$ "less" physical, not gauge invariant observable. Instead, the string momentum $P^{{\mu}=\partial_0 \Pi^{{\mu}$ is a gauge invariant quantity because $\Pi^{{'}_{{\mu} = \Pi_{{\mu}$.\\   Quantization of the bosonic string {{\it B} and its massless spectrum has been derived in \cite{{Savvidy:dv}. The absence of conformal anomaly requires the space-time to be 13-dimensional $D_c = 13$. In this string theory {{\it all particles, with arbitrary large integer spin, are massless}. This pure massless spectrum is consistent with the tensionless character of the model and it was conjectured in \cite{{Savvidy:dv} that it may describe unbroken phase of standard string theory  when $ \alpha^{{'} \rightarrow \infty$ and all masses tend to zero $M^{{2}_{{n} = {{1\over \alpha^{{'}}(n-1) \rightarrow 0$ \cite{{gross} .\\   Supersymmetric extension of the model {{\it B} with ${{\cal N}=1$ world-sheet supersymmetry was constructed in \cite{{Nichols:2002ux}. Here I shall demonstrate that actually it possesses enhanced fermionic symmetry which elevates ${{\cal N}=1 $ world-sheet supersymmetry to  ${{\cal N}=2 $ world-sheet supersymmetry. Indeed quantization of the supersymmetric model shows that its gauge algebra is identical with the well known ${{\cal N}=2 $ world-sheet superalgebra \cite{{Ademollo:1974fc}. This new field theory realization of the ${{\cal N}=2$ algebra is free from old problem \cite{{D'Adda:1987rx,Ooguri:1990ww,Ooguri:1991fp, Bershadsky:1993cx,Bershadsky:1993ta} connected with the introduction of second  space-time coordinate  $Y^{{\mu}$, which was introduced in addition to the coordinates $X^{{\mu}$ \cite{{Ademollo:1974fc}. Instead, in this model we have naturally two left-movers $q^{{\mu}_{{1}$ and $q^{{\mu}_{{2}$ and two right-movers $\tilde{{q}^{{~\mu}_{{1}$ and $\tilde{{q}^{{~\mu}_{{1}$ of the $X^{{\mu}$ field \cite{{Savvidy:dv} \beqa\label{{ritghleft} X^{{\mu}_{{L} = x^{{\mu} + {{1\over m}\pi^{{\mu}\zeta^{{+} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{{{2\over n m^2}}~ \{{q^{{\mu}_{{1n}\sin(n\zeta^{{+}) + q^{{\mu}_{{2n}\cos(n\zeta^{{+})\},\nonumber\\ X^{{\mu}_{{R} =   x^{{\mu} +  {{1\over m}\pi^{{\mu}\zeta^{{-} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{{{2\over  n m^2}}~ \{{\tilde{{q}^{{~\mu}_{{1n}\sin(n\zeta^{{-}) + \tilde{{q}^{{~\mu}_{{2n}\cos(n\zeta^{{-})\}.\nonumber \eeqa The conjugate field is described by a separate field $\Pi^{{\mu}$, \beqa \Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}=   m e^{{\mu} +  k^{{\mu}\zeta^{{+} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{{{2m^2\over n}} \{{ -p^{{\mu}_{{1n}\cos(n\zeta^{{+}) + p^{{\mu}_{{2n}\sin(n\zeta^{{+})\},\nonumber\\ \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}=   m e^{{\mu} + k^{{\mu}\zeta^{{-} + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1}\sqrt{{{{2m^2\over n}} \{{-\tilde{{p}^{{\mu}_{{1n}\cos(n\zeta^{{-}) + \tilde{{p}^{{\mu}_{{2n}\sin(n\zeta^{{-})\}, \nonumber \eeqa therefore we have two times more degrees of freedom than in the standard bosonic string theory. This result can be qualitatively understood if one takes into account the fact that the field equations here are of the fourth order (\ref{{confequa1}). Notice that there is also doubling of zero modes, the new zero mode coordinates are $e^{{\mu}$ and their conjugate variables are $\pi^{{\mu}$, they describe transversal polarizations \cite{{Savvidy:dv}.\\    In the first part of this article I shall review the quantization of the bosonic tensionless string and shall describe its symmetries. In the second part I shall present oscillator representation of the supersymmetric extension of the model and its quantization. In the last section the twisted topological string model will be constructed in analogy with the standard prescription for ${{\cal N }=2 $ superconformal field theories \cite{{witten,Labastida:1988zb,Montano:1988dr,eguchi,Ooguri:1995cp}.  \section{{Closed Bosonic Strings}  In this section I shall review some facts concerning solution and quantization of the closed bosonic string which was defined in the previous section and shall discuss algebraic structure of the corresponding gauge symmetries (\ref{{oldalgebra}),(\ref{{newalgebra1}) and (\ref{{newalgebra}). As we shall see they naturally contain Virasoro algebra as its subalgebra and additional new generators $\Theta_{{nk}$ associated with new gauge symmetry (\ref{{newgauge}) forming an Abelian subalgebra. The conformal algebra has here its classical form with twice larger central charge $2 \times {{D\over 12} = {{D\over 6}$. This result can be qualitatively understood if one takes into account the fact that the field equations here are of the fourth order and therefore we have two left and two right movers of $X^{{\mu}$ field, two times more degrees of freedom than in the standard bosonic string theory. Therefore it is not surprising that the absence of conformal anomaly requires the space-time to be 13-dimensional: $D_c = 13$.\\   For the closed bosonic strings the mode expansion of $X$ field (\ref{{ritghleft}) can be written in the form \cite{{Savvidy:dv}: \beqa\label{{decom} X^{{\mu}_{{L} = x^{{\mu} + {{1\over m}\pi^{{\mu}\zeta^{{+} + i\sum_{{n \neq 0}  {{1\over n }~ \beta^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-in\zeta^{{+}},\nonumber\\ X^{{\mu}_{{R} =   x^{{\mu} +  {{1\over m}\pi^{{\mu}\zeta^{{-} + i\sum_{{n \neq 0}  {{1\over n }~ \tilde{{\beta}^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-in\zeta^{{-}},\nonumber \eeqa where $ X^{{\mu}= {{1\over 2}(X^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^+) + X^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^-)), $ and in similar manner $\Pi^{{\mu}  = {{1\over 2}(\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}(\zeta^{{+}) + \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}(\zeta^{{-})) $ \beqa \Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}=   m e^{{\mu} +  k^{{\mu}\zeta^{{+} + i\sum_{{n \neq 0}  {{1\over n }~ \alpha^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-in\zeta^{{+}},\nonumber\\ \Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}=   m e^{{\mu} + k^{{\mu}\zeta^{{-} + i\sum_{{n \neq 0}  {{1\over n }~ \tilde{{\alpha}^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-in\zeta^{{-}}. \eeqa The nonzero commutator is $ [\partial_{{\pm} X^{{\mu}_{{L,R}(\zeta), \partial_{{\pm}\Pi^{{\nu}_{{L,R}(\zeta^{{'})]= 2\pi i~ \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta^{{~'} (\zeta  - \zeta^{{'}), $ with all others equal to zero. The momentum density operator is $2P^{{\mu}  = \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L} + \partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R} = P^{{\mu}_{{L} + P^{{\mu}_{{R}$. This canonical commutation among the fields imply also the following commutation relations among the coefficients of the Fourier expansion (\ref{{decom}): \beqa [e^{{\mu}, \pi^{{\nu}]=[x^{{\mu}, k^{{\nu}] =  i\eta^{{\mu\nu},~~~ ~[\alpha^{{\mu}_{{n}, \beta^{{\nu}_{{k}]= n~\eta^{{\mu\nu}\delta_{{n+k,0} \eeqa and similar ones for $\tilde{{\alpha}^{{\mu}_{{n}$ and $\tilde{{\beta}^{{\mu}_{{n}$. All other commutators are equal to zero.  They are connected with the creation and annihilation operators in the following way \beqa \alpha^{{\mu}_{{n}&=& m \sqrt{{n}~a^{{\mu}_{{n}, ~~~ n > 0,~~~~~\alpha^{{\mu}_{{0}=k^{{\mu};~~~ \beta^{{\mu}_{{n}= {{1\over m} \sqrt{{n}~b^{{\mu}_{{n},~~~ n > 0,~~~~~\beta^{{\mu}_{{0}=\pi^{{\mu}/m  \nonumber\\ \alpha^{{\mu}_{{-n}&=& m \sqrt{{n}~a^{{+\mu}_{{n}, ~~~ n > 0,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \beta^{{\mu}_{{-n}= {{1\over m} \sqrt{{n}~b^{{+\mu}_{{n},~~~ n > 0, \eeqa with nonzero commutator $ [a^{{\mu}_{{n},b^{{+\mu}_{{m}]= \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta_{{nm}. $  The Virasoro operators $L_n$  and new operators $\Theta_{{n,k}$ are defined as \be\label{{constcompo} L_{{n}  = <e^{{in\zeta^+} :P^{{\mu}_{{L}~\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L}: >,~~~~ \Theta_{{n,l}  =  <e^{{in\zeta^+ + il\zeta^-} :  \Pi^{{\mu}~\Pi^{{\mu} -m^2  :> \ee and have the form \beqa\label{{oscillators} L_{{n} &=&\sum_{{l}:\alpha_{{n-l} \cdot\beta_{{l}:~~~~~ \tilde{{L}_{{n} =\sum_{{l}: \tilde{{\alpha}_{{n-l} \cdot \tilde{{\beta}_{{l}:\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{0,0} &=& m^2( e^{{2} -1) + \sum_{{n \neq 0} {{1\over 4 n^2}:(\alpha_{{-n}~\alpha_{{n} + \tilde{{\alpha}_{{-n}~\tilde{{\alpha}_{{n}):\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{n,0} &=& {{im\over n}~e \cdot \alpha_{{n} -{{1\over 4}\sum_{{l \neq 0,n} {{1\over (n-l)l}:\alpha_{{n-l}\cdot\alpha_{{l}:~~~~~~~~~~~n=\pm1,\pm2,..\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{0,n} &=&{{im\over n}~e \cdot \tilde{{\alpha}_{{n} -{{1\over 4}\sum_{{l \neq 0,n} {{1\over (n-l)l}:\tilde{{\alpha}_{{n-l}\cdot\tilde{{\alpha}_{{l}: ~~~~~~~~~~~n=\pm1,\pm2,..\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{n,k} &=& -{{1\over 2 n k}:\alpha_{{n}\cdot\tilde{{\alpha}_{{k}: ~~~~~~~~~n,k= \pm 1, \pm 2,.... \eeqa The conformal algebra has here its classical form but with twice larger central charge \be\label{{oldalgebra} [L_n ~,~ L_k] = (n-k) L_{{n+k} + {{D\over 6}(n^3 -n)\delta_{{n+k,0} \ee and with the similar expression for right movers $\tilde{{L}_n$. The reason that the central charge is twice bigger than in the standard bosonic string theory $2 \times {{D\over 12} = {{D\over 6}$ is simply because we have two left and two right movers of $X_{{\mu}$ field. Such doubling of modes is reminiscent to the bosonic part of the ${{\cal N}=2$ superstring \cite{{Ademollo:1974fc}. In the last model there was an essential problem in identifying the $Y^{{\mu}$ coordinates which are introduced in addition to the normal coordinates $X^{{\mu}$ \cite{{Ademollo:1974fc}. In our model the coordinate field $X$ has simply two sets of commuting oscillators and the conjugate fields are described by the separate field $\Pi$ .  The full extended gauge symmetry algebra of constraints (\ref{{constcompo}) takes the form \beqa\label{{newalgebra1} ~[L_n  ~, \Theta_{{0,0}] &=& -2n  \Theta_{{n,0}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [\tilde{{L}_n  ~, \Theta_{{0,0}] = -2n \Theta_{{0,n} \nonumber\\ ~[L_n , \Theta_{{k,0}] &=& -(n+k) \Theta_{{n+k,0}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [\tilde{{L}_n , \Theta_{{k,0}] = -2n \Theta_{{k,n}\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , \Theta_{{0,k}] &=& -2n\Theta_{{n,k}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [\tilde{{L}_n ,  \Theta_{{0,k}] = -(n+k) \Theta_{{0,n+k} \nonumber\\ ~[L_{{n} , \Theta_{{k,l}] &=& -(n+k) \Theta_{{n+k,l}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [\tilde{{L}_n , \Theta_{{k,l}] = -(n+l) \Theta_{{k,n+l} \nonumber\\ \eeqa and one should stress that it is an essentially Abelian extension \be\label{{newalgebra}  [\Theta_{{n,k} , \Theta_{{l,p}] = 0,~~~~~n,k,l,p=0, \pm 1,\pm 2,... \ee One can easily check that Jacobi identities  between all these operators are satisfied, therefore the relations (\ref{{oldalgebra}), (\ref{{newalgebra1}) and (\ref{{newalgebra}) define Abelian extension of Virasoro algebra. The equations (\ref{{oscillators}) suggest its oscillator representation.   To define the physical Hilbert space we should first impose the Virasoro constraints \beqa\label{{physicalh} (L_0 +a)\Psi_{{phys} &=&0\\ %\{{ {{k \cdot \pi \over m }  +\sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} %n(a^{{+}_n b_n + b^{{+}_n a_n) +a\}\Psi_{{phys}=0\\ L_n \Psi_{{phys} &=& %\{{\sqrt{{n}~ {{k \cdot b_n \over m} + \sqrt{{n} ~\pi \cdot a_n %+ \sum^{{n-1}_{{k=1} \sqrt{{k(n-k)}  a_{{k} \cdot b_{{n-k}  \nonumber\\ %&+& \sum^{{\infty}_{{k=1} \sqrt{{k(n+k)}(  a^{{+}_{{k} \cdot b_{{n+k} + % b^{{+}_{{k} \cdot a_{{n+k}) \} %\Psi_{{phys} =0 0,~~~~~~n =1,2..\nonumber \eeqa and then our new constraint $\Theta$. The last operator has a linear and quadratic $\tau$ dependence which in fact uniquely define the spectrum of this string theory $$ (\Pi^2 -m^2) = k^2 ~\tau^2 + 2\{{m e \cdot k ~ + ~ k\cdot\Pi_{{oscil} \} \tau + \Pi^{{2}_{{oscil} + 2m e \cdot \Pi_{{oscil} + m^2( e^2 -1). $$ Indeed the first operator diverges quadratically with $\tau$ and the second one linearly. Therefore in order to have normalizable states in physical Hilbert-Fock space one should impose corresponding constraints. We are enforced to define the physical Hilbert space as \be\label{{newconst} k^2 ~ \Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~e \cdot k ~\Psi_{{phys} =0, ~~~k \cdot \alpha_{{n}  ~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~k \cdot \tilde{{\alpha}_{{n} ~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~~~n>0. \ee The first equation states that {{\it all physical states with different spins are massless}. This is consistent with the tensionless character of the theory. The rest of the constraints take the form \beqa\label{{newconstraints} %\Theta_{{0,0} \Psi_{{phys}&=&0\nonumber\\ %\Theta_{{n,0}\Psi_{{phys} &=& 0~~~~~~~~~~~~n= 1,2,....\nonumber\\ %\Theta_{{0,n}\Psi_{{phys} &=&0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~n= 1,2,....\nonumber\\ \Theta_{{n,k}\Psi_{{phys}  &=&0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~n,k= 0,1,2,.... %{{1\over m^2}\Theta_{{0,0} \Psi_{{phys}  &=& %\{{( e^{{2} -1) + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} %{{1\over 2n}(a^{{+}_{{n}~a_{{n} + %\tilde{{a}^{{+}_{{n}~\tilde{{a}_{{n}) \}\Psi_{{phys}= 0 %{{1 \over m^2}\Theta_{{n,0}\Psi_{{phys} &=& \{{{{i\over \sqrt{{n}} e \cdot a_{{n} %-{{1\over 4} \sum^{{n-1}_{{l=1} %{{a _{{l}~a_{{n-l}\over   \sqrt{{l(n-l)}}  -{{1\over 2} \sum^{{\infty}_{{l=1} %{{a^{{+}_{{l}~a_{{n+l}\over \sqrt{{l(n+l)}}  \}\Psi_{{phys} =0\nonumber\\ %{{1\over m^2}\Theta_{{0,n}\Psi_{{phys} &=& \{{{{i\over \sqrt{{n}}e \cdot \tilde{{a}_{{n} %-{{1\over 4} \sum^{{n-1}_{{l=1} %{{ \tilde{{a} _{{l}~\tilde{{a}_{{n-l} \over \sqrt{{l(n-l)} } - %{{1\over 2} \sum^{{\infty}_{{l=1} %{{\tilde{{a}^{{+}_{{l}~\tilde{{a}_{{n+l} \over \sqrt{{l(n+l)} }\}\Psi_{{phys} =0\nonumber\\ %{{1\over m^2}\Theta_{{n,k}\Psi_{{phys}  &=& \{{ - {{1\over 2\sqrt{{nk}} a_{{n}~\tilde{{a}_{{k} %\}\Psi_{{phys} =0 ~~~~~~~~~~~~n,k= 1,2,.... \eeqa Thus the the physical Hilbert space is defined by the equations (\ref{{physicalh}), (\ref{{newconst}) and (\ref{{newconstraints}). In the next section we shall consider ${{\cal N}=1$ world-sheet supersymmetric extension of the above model \cite{{Nichols:2002ux} and shall demonstrate that it actually exhibits the ${{\cal N}=2$ world-sheet supersymmetry.   \section{{${{\cal N} = 1$ World-sheet Supersymmetry}  In the recent article \cite{{Nichols:2002ux} the authors constructed the ${{\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric extension of the above model using world-sheet superfields \cite{{ramond,neveu,zumino,green,polchinski}. Both forms of the action (\ref{{gaga}) can be extended to the supersymmetric case as follows. For the basic fields~$(X,\Pi,\Omega)$ in (\ref{{gaga}) one should introduce the corresponding superfields \beqa \hat{{X}^{{\mu} &=& X^{{\mu} + \bar{{\vartheta} \Psi^{{\mu}+ {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta F^{{\mu}\nonumber\\ \hat{{\Pi}^{{\mu} &=& \Pi^{{\mu} + \bar{{\vartheta} \eta^{{\mu}+ {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \Phi^{{\mu}\nonumber\\ \hat{{\Omega}  &=&  \omega  + \bar{{\vartheta} \xi + {{1\over 2} \bar{{\vartheta} \vartheta \Omega , \eeqa where $\vartheta$ is an anti-commuting variable and shall define the supersymmetric action simply exchanging basic fields ~$(X,\Pi,\Omega)$ in (\ref{{gaga}) by corresponding superfields as follows \be\label{{firstordsusy} S = {{-i \over 2\pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta d^{{2} \theta \{{ ~\hat{{\Pi}^{{\mu} \bar{{D} D \hat{{X}^{{\mu} - 2\hat{{\Omega} ( \hat{{\Pi}^{{2} -m^2)~\}, \ee where \be D_A = {{ \partial \over \partial \bar{{\vartheta}^A} - i (\rho^{{a} \vartheta)_A \partial_{{a},~~~~ \Psi^{{\mu}_{{A}(\zeta) \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}(\zeta)\\      \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}(\zeta)      \end{{array} \right),~\eta^{{\mu}_{{A}(\zeta)      \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}(\zeta)\\      \eta^{{\mu}_{{+}(\zeta)      \end{{array} \right),~\xi_{{A}(\zeta)      \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \xi_{{-}(\zeta)\\      \xi_{{+}(\zeta)      \end{{array} \right), \ee $\mu$ is a space-time vector index, $A=1,2$ is a two-dimensional spinor index.  $\bar{{\Psi}^{{\mu} = \Psi^{{+\mu} \rho^{{0}= \Psi^{{T\mu} \rho^{{0}$ and $\rho^{{\alpha}$ are two-dimensional Dirac matrices \be \{{ \rho^{{a},\rho^{{b} \} =-2 \eta^{{a b}. \ee In Majorana basis the $\rho's$ are given by \be \rho^{{0} = \left( \begin{{array}{{cc}      0&-i\\      i&0      \end{{array} \right),~~~~\rho^{{1} = \left( \begin{{array}{{cc}      0&i\\      i&0      \end{{array} \right) \ee and $i\rho^{{\alpha}\partial_{{\alpha}$ is a real operator. The two-dimensional chiral fields are defined as $ \rho^{{3}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm} = \mp \Psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm}, $ where $\rho^{{3}=\rho^{{0}\rho^{{1}$. Substituting superfields one can get the following expression for the action \cite{{Nichols:2002ux} \beqa\label{{fullaction} S = {{1\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~\{{ ~\Pi^{{\mu}\partial^2 X^{{\mu} + i\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} -F^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu}~~\nonumber\\ ~~-\Omega (\Pi^2 -m^2) -  \omega (2\Pi^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} + \bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\eta^{{\mu}) - 2 \Pi^{{\mu}~\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\xi~\}. \eeqa The equations of motion are: \beqa\label{{fullequationa} (I)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\Phi^{{\mu} =0\nonumber\\ \partial^2 \Pi^{{\mu} =0\nonumber\\ i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\eta^{{\mu}=0\nonumber\\ 2 \omega \Pi^{{\mu} + F^{{\mu} =0\nonumber\\ \partial^2 X^{{\mu} - 2\Omega \Pi^{{\mu} -2\omega \Phi^{{\mu} -2\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\xi=0\nonumber\\ i\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} -2\Pi^{{\mu}\xi -2 \omega\eta^{{\mu}=0, \eeqa and the variation over Lagrange multipliers gives constraints \beqa\label{{fullconstrants} (II)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\Pi^2 -m^2 =0\nonumber\\ 2\Pi^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} + \bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\eta^{{\mu}=0\nonumber\\ 2 \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu} =0. \eeqa The first equation represents the constrain which appears in bosonic tensionless string theory and the last equation represents its fermionic partners. As we shall see the first one is the analog of Klein-Gordon equation and the second one is the analog of the Dirac equation. In some sense they are more important relations than the motion equations (I). The SUSY transformation is: \beqa \begin{{array}{{lll}\label{{susy} \delta X^{{\mu} = \bar{{\epsilon}\Psi^{{\mu},\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} X^{{\mu} ~\epsilon  ~+~F^{{\mu}~\epsilon ,\\ \delta F^{{\mu} = -i \bar{{\epsilon} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}, \end{{array} \begin{{array}{{lll} \delta \Pi^{{\mu} = \bar{{\epsilon}\eta^{{\mu},\\ \delta \eta^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} \Pi^{{\mu} ~\epsilon  ~+~\Phi^{{\mu}~\epsilon ,\\ \delta \Phi^{{\mu} = -i \bar{{\epsilon} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\eta^{{\mu},\\ \end{{array} \begin{{array}{{lll} \delta \omega = \bar{{\epsilon}\xi,\\ \delta \xi^{{\mu} = -i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a} \omega ~\epsilon  ~+~\Omega~\epsilon ,\\ \delta \Omega = -i \bar{{\epsilon} \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\xi, \end{{array} \eeqa where the anti-commuting parameter $\epsilon$ is a two-dimensional spinor \begin{{eqnarray}\epsilon \equiv \left( \begin{{array}{{c}      \epsilon_{{-}\\      \epsilon_{{+}      \end{{array} \right).\nonumber \end{{eqnarray} The action (\ref{{fullaction}), equations (\ref{{fullequationa}) and the constraints (\ref{{fullconstrants}) completely define the system which exhibits the supersymmetry (\ref{{susy}).  As we shall see bellow the action (\ref{{fullaction}) possesses enhanced fermionic symmetry which elevates ${{\cal N}=1 $ world-sheet supersymmetry up to  ${{\cal N}=2 $ world-sheet supersymmetry. It is convenient to work in light-cone coordinates. In the light-cone coordinates the action takes the form \beqa\label{{lagran} S = {{2\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~\{{ - 2\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu} + i\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{-}\psi^{{\mu}_{{+} + i\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{+}\psi^{{\mu}_{{-} - {{1\over 2}F^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu}~~~\nonumber\\ ~~-{{1\over 2}\Omega (\Pi^2 -m^2) -  \omega (\Pi^{{\mu}\Phi^{{\mu} +  i\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}) -i \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\xi_{{-} + i \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\xi_{{+}~\}. \eeqa and equations of motion can be solved. As one can see the SUSY solution of equations (\ref{{fullequationa}) is: $$ i) \Omega =\omega  =\xi =0 $$ and the rest of the equations (I) reduce to the following form \beqa (I)~~~~~\partial^2 \Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~i \rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\eta^{{\mu}=0,~~~ \partial^2 X^{{\mu} =0,~~~ i\rho^{{a} \partial_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} =0,~~~F^{{\mu}=\Phi^{{\mu}=0 \eeqa and should be accompanied by the constraints \beqa (II)~~~~~\Pi^2 -m^2 =0,~~~~\bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\eta^{{\mu}=0,~~~~ \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu} =0. \eeqa In the light-cone coordinates these  equations  are easy to solve since they take the from \beqa\label{{allequations} \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-} \Pi^{{\mu} =0,~~~\partial_{{\pm}\eta^{{\mu}_{{\mp}=0,~~~ \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}  X^{{\mu} =0,~~~ \partial_{{\pm}\psi^{{\mu}_{{\mp} =0,\nonumber\\ \Pi^2 -m^2 =0,~~~~\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-} - \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+} =0~~~~ \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm} =0. \eeqa The mode expansion of $X$ field with the appropriate boundary conditions for closed strings was given above (\ref{{decom}). The solution of fermionic fields can be represented in the form of mode expansion as well \beqa \eta^{{\mu}_{{+}= \sum c^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{+}},~~~~~ \psi^{{\mu}_{{+}= \sum d^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{+}}\nonumber\\ \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}= \sum \tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{-}},~~~~~ \psi^{{\mu}_{{-}= \sum \tilde{{d}^{{\mu}_{{n} e^{{-i n\zeta^{{-}} \eeqa with the basic anti-commutators \beqa\begin{{array}{{lll} \{{ \eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm}(\zeta),\psi^{{\nu}_{{\pm}(\zeta^{{'})\}= 2\pi \eta^{{\mu\nu} \delta(\zeta - \zeta^{{'}), \end{{array} \eeqa and all others equal to zero: $\{{ \eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm}(\zeta),\eta^{{\nu}_{{\pm}(\zeta^{{'})\}= 0,~ \{{ \psi^{{\mu}_{{\pm}(\zeta),\psi^{{\nu}_{{\pm}(\zeta^{{'})\}= 0$. Substituting the mode expansion into the anti-commutators requires following relations between modes \beqa\label{{anticomm} \{{c^{{\mu}_{{n}, d^{{\nu}_{{k}\}= \eta^{{\mu\nu}\delta_{{n+k,0},~~~~ \{{c^{{\mu}_{{n}, c^{{\nu}_{{k}\}= 0,~~~~~\{{d^{{\mu}_{{n}, d^{{\nu}_{{k}\}= 0, \eeqa and similar ones for $\tilde{{c}^{{\mu}_{{n}$ and $\tilde{{d}^{{\mu}_{{n}$.  \section{{Enhanced ${{\cal N} = 2$ World-sheet supersymmetry} Let us now consider conserved currents: energy momentum tensor and supercurrent \beqa T_{{ab} &=& ~\partial_{{\{{a } \Pi^{{\mu}~\partial_{{b\}} X^{{\mu} + i \bar{{\eta^{{\mu}}\rho_{{\{{a} \partial_{{b\}}\Psi^{{\mu}  -trace \nonumber\\ J_{{a} &=& {{1\over 2 }\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a} \Psi^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}\Pi^{{\mu}+{{1\over 2 }\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a} \eta^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu} \eeqa or in the light-cone coordinates \beqa T_{{++}&=&2\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu} + i \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} - {{i\over 2}\partial_{{+} ( \eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}) ,\nonumber\\ T_{{--}&=&2\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{-}X^{{\mu} + i \eta^{{\mu}_{{-} \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} - {{i\over 2}\partial_{{-} ( \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}) ,  \nonumber\\  J_+ &=& 2\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} + 2\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu},\nonumber\\ J_- &=& 2\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} + 2\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}, \eeqa Substituting solution (\ref{{decom}) into the last formulas one can get \beqa T_{{++}&=&{{1 \over 2}~\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}~\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L}+ {{i\over 2} \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} - {{i\over 2} \partial_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},\nonumber\\ T_{{--}&=&{{1 \over 2}~\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}~\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}_{{R} + {{i\over 2} \eta^{{\mu}_{{-} \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} - {{i\over 2}\partial_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} ,\nonumber\\ J_+ &=& \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}  + \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nonumber\\ J_- &=& \partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} + \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}_{{R}. \eeqa The mode expansion of these currents is equal to \beqa L_{{n}  &=& <e^{{in\zeta^+} T_{{++} >= \sum_{{l}:\alpha_{{n-l} \cdot\beta_{{l}: +\sum_{{l}:(l-{{n\over 2}) c_{{n-l} \cdot d_{{l}: \nonumber\\ F_{{n}  &=&  <e^{{in\zeta^+} J_{{+} >= \sum_{{l}\alpha_{{n-l} \cdot d_{{l}  + \sum_{{l}\beta_{{n-l} \cdot c_{{l}. \eeqa The standard computation of quantum commutation relations between these currents gives \beqa [L_n , L_m ] &=& (n-m) L_{{n+m} + {{D\over 4} m^3 \delta_{{n+m}\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , F_m ] &=& ({{n\over 2}-m) F_{{n+m}\nonumber\\ ~\{{F_n , F_m \} &=& 2 L_{{n+m} + D n^2 \delta_{{n+m}. \eeqa This is a standard  ${{\cal N}=1 $ superalgebra with the central charge twice larger than in the standard superstring theory. It is also clear from the expression for the full supercurrent $J_a$ that its two separate pieces $G^{{1}_a ={{1\over 2 }\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a} \eta^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}X^{{\mu}$ and $G^{{2}_a = {{1\over 2 }\rho^{{b}\rho_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu}\partial_{{b}\Pi^{{\mu}$ also represent conserved currents and therefore pointing to the fact that there should exist a higher symmetry group. In the light-cone coordinates these currents have the form \beqa\label{{N2generators} G^{{1}_+ &=& 2\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}~\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu},~~~~~~~~~~ G^{{2}_+ = 2\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},\nonumber\\ G^{{1}_- &=& 2\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}~\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}, ~~~~~~~~~~G^{{2}_- = 2\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}. \eeqa Mode expansion of these currents is defined as: \beqa G^{{1}_{{n}  &=&  <e^{{in\zeta^+} G^{{1}_{{+} >= \sum_{{l} \beta_{{n-l} \cdot c_{{l} \nonumber\\ G^{{2}_{{n}  &=&  <e^{{in\zeta^+} G^{{2}_{{+} >= \sum_{{l} \alpha_{{n-l} \cdot d_{{l} \eeqa therefore $$ F_n = G^{{1}_n + G^{{2}_n $$ These conserved currents form the following algebra \beqa ~[L_n , G^{{1}_m ] &=& ({{n\over 2}-m) G^{{1}_{{n+m},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(J=3/2)\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , G^{{2}_m ] &=& ({{n\over 2}-m) G^{{2}_{{n+m},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(J=3/2)\nonumber\\ ~\{{G^{{1}_n , G^{{1}_m \} &=&  0,~~~~~~~ \nonumber\\ ~\{{G^{{2}_n , G^{{2}_m \} &=&  0. \eeqa Here J denotes the conformal spin of the corresponding operators. The anti-commutator $\{{ G^{{1}_n , G^{{2}_m \}$ cannot be computed in closed form unless we introduce additional current \beqa\label{{u1current} T_{{a} = {{1\over 2 }~\bar{{\eta}^{{\mu} \rho_{{a}\Psi^{{\mu} \eeqa which appears to be also conserved as it is easy to check using equations of motion. This conserved current is connected with the $U(1)$ invariance of the action which rotates fermionic fields. Its components are $T_+ = -\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},~~T_- = -\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-},~~\partial_{{-} T_+ = \partial_{{+} T_- =0,$ and mode expansion is \beqa  T_{{n}  =  <e^{{in\zeta^+} T_{{+} > = -\sum_{{l}:c_{{n-l} \cdot d_{{l}:~. \eeqa Then we can compute the anti-commutator: $$ ~\{{G^{{1}_n , G^{{2}_m \} = L_{{n+m} +{{1\over 2}(n-m)T_{{n+m} + {{D\over 2}n^2 \delta_{{n+m,0} $$ and the rest of the algebra will take the form: \beqa ~[L_n , T_m ] &=&  -m T_{{n+m} ,~~~~~(J=1)\nonumber\\ ~[T_n , T_m ] &=& D n \delta_{{n+m,0} \nonumber\\ ~[T_n , G^{{1}_m ] &=& -G^{{1}_{{n+m}         \nonumber\\ ~[T_n , G^{{2}_m ] &=& +G^{{2}_{{n+m} \eeqa It is clear now that this is a well known ${{\cal N}=2$ superconformal algebra \cite{{Ademollo:1974fc} and that initially implemented ${{\cal N}=1$ SUSY transformation has been naturally enhanced to ${{\cal N}=2$ world-sheet supersymmetry. This symmetry can also be seen if one introduces the ${{\cal N}=2$ superfield as follows \beqa \hat{{X}^{{\mu}(\zeta,\vartheta_1 , \vartheta_2) = X^{{\mu} +  \vartheta_1 \Psi^{{\mu}+ \vartheta_2 \eta^{{\mu}  + \vartheta_2 \vartheta_1 \Pi^{{\mu}\nonumber\\ =X^{{\mu} +  \vartheta_1 \Psi^{{\mu} +\vartheta_2 ~(\eta^{{\mu}  +  \vartheta_1 \Pi^{{\mu}). \eeqa The important point is that there is no natural extensions of the superfield $\hat{{\Omega}$  to ${{\cal N}=2$ superfield, simply because the constrain $\Pi^2 -m^2 =0$ breaks the symmetry between $X$ and $\Pi$ fields. This can be seen as a sign that actually the whole system together with constraints breaks the ${{\cal N}=2$ down to ${{\cal N}=1$. This observation makes the computation of critical dimension more subtle here. In particular it is not obvious at all that it should be two, as it is the case for ${{\cal N}=2$ strings.  Let us now consider the  new superconstraints (II) (\ref{{allequations}) which appear in our case : $\Delta = \Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm}$ \be \Delta^{{\pm}_{{n,l} = <e^{{in\zeta^+ + il\zeta^-} :\Pi^{{\mu}~\eta^{{\mu}_{{\pm} :> \ee or in terms of oscillators \beqa\label{{susyconstraints} \Delta^{{+}_{{0,0} &=&  m e\cdot c_0 + \sum_{{n \neq 0}  \alpha_{{-n}~c_{{n},~~~~~~\Delta^{{-}_{{0,0} =  m e\cdot \tilde{{c}_0 + \sum_{{n \neq 0}  \tilde{{\alpha}_{{-n}~\tilde{{c}_{{n},\nonumber\\ \Delta^{{+}_{{n,0} &=& i\sum_{{l \neq 0,n} \alpha_{{n-l}\cdot c_{{l},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \Delta^{{-}_{{0,n} =i \sum_{{l \neq 0,n} \tilde{{\alpha}_{{n-l}\cdot\tilde{{c}_{{l} , ~~~~n=\pm 1,\pm 2,...\nonumber\\ \Delta^{{+}_{{n,l} &=&  \alpha_{{n}\cdot\tilde{{c}_{{l},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \Delta^{{-}_{{n,l} =  \tilde{{\alpha}_{{n}\cdot c_{{l},~~~~n,l=\pm 1,\pm 2,... \eeqa The important fact which uniquely defines the spectrum of this superstring theory is again the $\tau$ dependence of the operators $\Pi^2$ and $\Pi\cdot\eta_{{\pm} $ \beqa &(\Pi^2 -m^2) = k^2 ~\tau^2 + 2\{{m e \cdot k ~ + ~ k\cdot\Pi_{{oscil} \} \tau +  m^2( e^2 -1)+ 2m e \cdot \Pi_{{oscil}+\Pi^{{2}_{{oscil} ,\nonumber\\ &\Pi\cdot\eta_{{+}= (c_0\cdot k  + k\cdot\eta_{{+~oscil} ) \tau + m e\cdot c_0  + m e \cdot \eta_{{+~oscil} + \Pi_{{oscil}\cdot \eta_{{+~oscil},\nonumber\\ &\Pi\cdot\eta_{{-}= (\tilde{{c}_0\cdot k  + k\cdot\eta_{{-~oscil} ) \tau + m e\cdot \tilde{{c}_0  + m e \cdot \eta_{{-~oscil} + \Pi_{{oscil}\cdot \eta_{{-~oscil}. \eeqa The first operator diverges quadratically with $\tau$ and the second one linearly in bosonic sector and we have linear divergency of first operators in fermionic sector. Therefore in order to have normalizable states in physical Hilbert space one should impose corresponding constraints. We are enforced to define the physical Hilbert space as \beqa k^2 ~ \Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~c_0\cdot k~\Psi_{{phys} = 0,~~~\tilde{{c}_0\cdot k~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nonumber\\ k \cdot \alpha_{{n}  ~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~k \cdot \tilde{{\alpha}_{{n} ~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~ ~~~ k \cdot c_{{n}  ~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~k \cdot \tilde{{c}_{{n} ~\Psi_{{phys} =0,~~~~~n>0 ,\nonumber\\ e \cdot k ~\Psi_{{phys} =0.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \eeqa All these constraints can naturally be grouped  into three systems of equations. The first three equations are nothing else but massless  Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations and uniquely define the spectrum of the theory. We conclude that {{\it all physical states with integer and half integer spins are massless}. This is consistent with tensionless character of the theory. The second system of equations imposes important condition of transversality on fermion and boson oscillators.  Finally the last equation suggests that the  vector $e_{{\mu}$ should be interpreted as polarization vector transverse to the momentum vector $k_{{\mu}$.  We should  impose  the constraints of ${{\cal N}=2$ superconformal algebra \beqa\label{{last} (L_0 +a )\Psi_{{phys} &=&0\nonumber\\ L_n \Psi_{{phys}&=&0, ~~~~~~n=1,2,.. \nonumber\\ T_0 \Psi_{{phys}&=&0        \nonumber\\ T_n \Psi_{{phys}&=&0,~~~~~~n=1,2,.. \nonumber\\ %m L_0 \Psi_{{phys} = \{{k \cdot \pi  +m \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} %n(a^{{+}_n b_n + b^{{+}_n a_n) + m \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} %n(c^{{+}_n d_n + d^{{+}_n c_n)  \}\Psi_{{phys} &=&0\nonumber\\ %T_0 \Psi_{{phys}=\{{d_0 c_0 +  \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} %(d^{{+}_n c_n - c^{{+}_n d_n)\}\Psi_{{phys} &=&0        \nonumber\\ %L_n \Psi_{{phys}=0,~~~~~~T_n \Psi_{{phys}=0,~~~~~~ G^{{1}_n \Psi_{{phys}&=&0,~~~~~~n=1,2,.. \nonumber\\ G^{{2}_n \Psi_{{phys}&=&0,~~~~~~n=1,2,.. \eeqa together with the additional constraints $\Theta_{{k,l}$ (\ref{{newconstraints}) and fermionic constraints (\ref{{susyconstraints}) \beqa %\Delta^{{\pm}_{{0,0}\Psi_{{phys}&=&0\nonumber\\ %= \{{ c_0 \cdot e  + \sum^{{\infty}_{{n=1} %\sqrt{{n}(a^{{+}_{{n}~c_{{n} + c^{{+}_{{n}~a_{{n})\}\Psi_{{phys} %\Delta^{{\pm}_{{n,0}\Psi_{{phys}&=&0,~~~~~n=1,2,..\nonumber\\ %\Delta^{{\pm}_{{0,n}\Psi_{{phys}&=&0,~~~~~n=1,2,..\nonumber\\ \Delta^{{\pm}_{{n,l}\Psi_{{phys}&=&0,~~~~~n,l =0,1,2,... \eeqa One should study in great details this Hilbert space in order to learn more about content of the theory and to prove the absence of the negative norm states. We cannot also say anything certain about critical dimension of the model because we  have additional symmetries and the corresponding constraints, the influence of which on the calculation of the critical dimension at the moment is not quite well understood.  In the rest of the article we shall consider a close topological model which can be constructed by twisting \cite{{witten,Labastida:1988zb,Montano:1988dr,eguchi}. Indeed the redefinition of the energy momentum tensor by the total derivative of the U(1) current, leads to the topological theory. By this twisting operation the above ${{\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry transforms into BRST symmetry  as in \cite{{witten,eguchi}.   \section{{Twisted Topological Strings}  We shall obtain the topological version of the above ${{\cal N}=2$ theory by the redefinition of the energy momentum tensor T by $\hat{{T}$ as follows: $$ \hat{{T}_{{ab} = T_{{ab}  - {{i\over 2} \partial _{{a} J_b, $$ where $J_b$ is the U(1) current (\ref{{u1current}). In light-cone components we have \beqa \tilde{{T}_{{++}&=&2\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu} + i \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}, ~~~~~~~ \tilde{{T}_{{--}= 2\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu} \partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}+ i \eta^{{\mu}_{{-} \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} , \nonumber\\ F_+ &=& 2\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} + 2\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu},~~~~~~~~~~ F_-  =2\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}~\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}+ 2\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu},\nonumber\\ J_+ &=& - \eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ J_- = - \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}, \eeqa Substituting solutions (\ref{{decom}) into  the last formulas one can get \beqa \tilde{{T}_{{++}&=&{{1 \over 2}~\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}~\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L}+ i \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},\nonumber\\ \tilde{{T}_{{--}&=&{{1 \over 2}~\partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}~\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}_{{R} + i  \eta^{{\mu}_{{-} \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-},\nonumber\\ F^{{1}_+ &=& \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}  + \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\ F^{{1}_- &=& \partial_{{-}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{R}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} + \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}_{{R},\nonumber\\ J_+ &=& - \eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},  \nonumber\\ J_- &=& - \eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}, \eeqa Mode expansion of these currents is defined as: \beqa L_{{n}  &=& <e^{{in\zeta^+} \tilde{{T}_{{++} >= \sum_{{l}:\alpha_{{n-l} \cdot\beta_{{l}: +\sum_{{l}: l~  c_{{n-l} \cdot d_{{l}: \nonumber\\ F^{{1}_{{n}  &=&  <e^{{in\zeta^+} F_{{+} >= \sum_{{l}\alpha_{{n-l} \cdot d_{{l}  + \sum_{{l}\beta_{{n-l} \cdot c_{{l}  \nonumber\\ F^{{2}_{{n}  &=&  <e^{{in\zeta^+} F^{{2}_{{+} >= \sum_{{l} \alpha_{{n-l} \cdot d_{{l}  - \sum_{{l} \beta_{{n-l} \cdot c_{{l}  \nonumber\\ J_{{n}  &=&  <e^{{in\zeta^+} J_{{+} >= -\sum_{{l}:c_{{n-l} \cdot d_{{l}: \eeqa where we have introduced a new operator $F^{{2}_{{+}$ which is equal to the following expression \be F^{{2}_{{+} = \partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}_{{L} \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} - \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} \partial_{{+}X^{{\mu}_{{L}. \ee The necessity of introducing this operator comes from the fact that again when we compute the algebra between operators $T,F^{{1},J$  the algebra is closed only if we introduce this new operator. For these four operators the algebra is closed \beqa [L_n , L_m ] &=& (n-m) L_{{n+m},\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , F^{{1}_m ] &=& ({{n\over 2}-m) F^{{1}_{{n+m} - {{n\over 2} F^{{2}_{{n+m},\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , F^{{2}_{{m}] &=&  ({{n\over 2}-m) F^{{2}_{{n+m} - {{n\over 2}F^{{1}_{{n+m} ,\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , J_m ] &=&  -m J_{{n+m} - {{D \over 2}n(n+1)\delta_{{n+m,0}, \nonumber\\ ~[J_n , J_m ] &=& D n \delta_{{n+m,0} \nonumber\\ ~[J_n , F^{{1}_m ] &=& F^{{2}_{{n+m}         \nonumber\\ ~[J_n , F^{{2}_{{m} ] &=& F^{{1}_{{n+m}            \nonumber\\ ~\{{F^{{1}_n , F^{{1}_m \} &=&2L_{{n+m} +(n+m)J_{{n+m} + D~ n^2\delta_{{n+m,0} \nonumber\\ ~\{{F^{{1}_n , F^{{2}_{{m} \} &=&~~~~~~~~~-(n-m)J_{{n+m} + D~ n ~\delta_{{n+m,0}\nonumber\\ ~\{{F^{{2}_{{n}  , F^{{2}_{{m}  \} &= & -2L_{{n+m} -(n+m)J_{{n+m} - D~ n^2\delta_{{n+m,0} \eeqa There is no defined conformal dimensions for the fermion operators $F^{{1}$ and $F^{{2}$, they also do not have defined charges with respect to the $U(1)$ group. As it is easy to see the linear combination of these operators do have defined charges. Indeed we should introduce the linear combination of supercurrents as we did in  the previous model \be 2G_n = F^{{1}_n - F^{{2}_{{n},~~~~~2 Q_n =  F^{{1}_n + F^{{2}_{{n}, \ee in order to have diagonal form of supercurrent with respect to the conformal operator $L_n$. In coordinate space they look as (\ref{{N2generators}). For these conserved currents the algebra takes the form \beqa [L_n , L_m ] &=& (n-m) L_{{n+m},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(J=2)\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , G_m ] &=& (n-m) G_{{n+m},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(J=2)\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , Q_m ] &=&  -m Q_{{n+m},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(J=1)\nonumber\\ ~[L_n , J_m ] &=&  -m J_{{n+m} - {{D \over 2}n(n+1)\delta_{{n+m,0}~~~~~(J=1)\nonumber\\ ~[J_n , J_m ] &=& D m \delta_{{n+m,0} \nonumber\\ ~[J_n , G_m ] &=& -G_{{n+m}         \nonumber\\ ~[J_n , Q_m ] &=& +Q_{{n+m}            \nonumber\\ ~\{{G_n , G_m \} &=&  0,~~~~~~~ \nonumber\\ ~\{{Q_n , Q_m \} &=&  0,~~~~~~~ \nonumber\\ ~\{{G_n , Q_m \} &= & L_{{n+m} +mJ_{{n+m} + {{D\over 2}n(n+1)\delta_{{n+m,0} \eeqa which is well known in topological conformal field theory \cite{{eguchi}. One can see that we have here zero central charge and two nilpotent fermion operators $G$ and $Q$ which form the N=2 world-sheet supersymmetry. Two conserved supercurrents which appear above should have come from the explicit fermion symmetry of the theory. As we shall see in a moment these symmetries can be justified. One can check that the system is invariant under fermion transformation laws $\delta$ and $\bar{{\delta}$ defined as follows \cite{{Nichols:2002ux}: \beqa \begin{{array}{{llllll}\label{{newsusy} \delta X^{{\mu} = 0,\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} = -2\epsilon_{{+}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu} ,\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}=0,\\ \delta F^{{\mu} =  -2i  \epsilon_{{+}   \partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+},\\ \delta \Pi^{{\mu} =  i\epsilon_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-},\\ \delta \eta^{{\mu}_{{-} = 0 ,\\ \delta \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} =  - \epsilon_{{+}\Phi^{{\mu}~ ,\\ \delta \Phi^{{\mu} = 0, \end{{array}~~~~~ \begin{{array}{{lll} \bar{{\delta} X^{{\mu} = 0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} = 0,\\ \bar{{\delta }\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}= -2\epsilon_{{-}\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu} ,\\ \bar{{\delta} F^{{\mu} =  2i  \epsilon_{{-}   \partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-},\\ \bar{{\delta} \Pi^{{\mu} =  i\epsilon_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+},\\ \bar{{\delta}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-} =  \epsilon_{{-}\Phi^{{\mu}~ ,\\ \bar{{\delta}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+} = 0 ,\\ \bar{{\delta} \Phi^{{\mu} = 0, \end{{array}~~~~ \begin{{array}{{lll} \delta \omega =  i\epsilon_{{+}\xi_{{-},\\ \delta \xi_{{-} = 0,\\ \delta \xi_{{+} =  -\epsilon_{{+}\Omega,\\ \delta \Omega = 0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\omega = i\epsilon_{{-}\xi_{{+},\\ \bar{{\delta}\xi_{{-}= \epsilon_{{-}\Omega,\\ \bar{{\delta}\xi_{{+}=0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\Omega= 0, \end{{array} \eeqa The  algebra of these fermionic symmetries is nilpotent and is very similar to BRST transformations \be\label{{brst} \delta_{{\epsilon}\delta_{{\acute{{\epsilon}} ~ (H)  = \bar{{\delta}_{{\epsilon}\bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}}~ (H)= 0,~~~~~(\delta_{{\epsilon} \bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}} - \bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}}\delta_{{\epsilon} )~ (H)=0. \ee where H is any of the fields $ (X,\Psi,F,\Pi,\eta,\Phi,\omega,\xi,\Omega)$. From (\ref{{brst}) it follows that the action is invariant under fermionic symmetries (\ref{{newsusy}). We can compute  the current corresponding to this fermion symmetry. The variation of the action is \beqa \delta{{S} = {{2\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~\{{-2 i\epsilon_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-} \partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu} -i\epsilon_{{+}\Phi^{{\mu}\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} +i\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{+}(-2\epsilon_{{+}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}) \nonumber\\ -(1/2)(-2i\epsilon_{{+}\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+})\Phi^{{\mu} ~\}= -{{2i\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~G_{{-}~ \partial_{{+}(\epsilon_{{+}) \eeqa and supercurrent $G_{{-} = 2\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu}$ coincides with the one which appeared in the previous section. The important fact now is that the Lagrangian is a variation of the super-potentials $W$ and $\bar{{W}$ \be W = \Pi^{{\mu}~\partial_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} + {{1\over 2}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}~F^{{\mu},~~~~~ \bar{{W} =  \Pi^{{\mu}~\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} - {{1\over 2}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}~F^{{\mu}, \ee so that \be \delta W = \epsilon_{{+}{{\cal L},~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \bar{{\delta} ~\bar{{W} =\epsilon_{{-}{{\cal L}. \ee It is also true that there exists a potential $V$ such that \beqa \delta ~V= -i\epsilon_{{+} \bar{{W},~~~~  ~\bar{{\delta} ~V =  i \epsilon_{{-} W,~~~~~V= {{1\over 2}\Pi^{{\mu} F^{{\mu}, \eeqa thus $$ i\delta \bar{{\delta}  V = \epsilon_{{+}\epsilon_{{-}{{\cal L}, ~~~~~~~i\bar{{\delta} \delta  V = \epsilon_{{+}\epsilon_{{-}{{\cal L}. $$ The constrains (II) can  also be represented by the $\bar{{\delta} \delta$ transformation and therefore the full Lagrangian in (\ref{{lagran}) can be represented as \be 2\epsilon_{{+}\epsilon_{{-}{{\cal L}_{{tot} = ~i\bar{{\delta} \delta~  \left(  \Pi^{{\mu} F^{{\mu} + \omega (\Pi^2 -m^2)   \right). \ee Thus the action can be represented as BRST commutator ${{\cal L} = \{{ G_+ , W   \}=\{{  G_{{-},\bar{{W }  \}$. The above fermion symmetry allows to express some important operators as variation of others. In particular the energy momentum tensor is a variation of second supercurrent $Q$, but only up to the total derivative of $U(1)$ current $J_a$ \beqa \bar{{\delta}~Q_{{+}&=&-2\epsilon_- T_{{++} + 2i\epsilon_-\partial_{{+}J_{{+}  ,\nonumber\\ \delta~Q_{{-}&=&-2\epsilon_+ T_{{--}  + 2i\epsilon_+\partial_{{-}J_{{-}  , \eeqa Instead, the supercurrent $G$ introduced above is total variation of the vector $v_a = \Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{a} X^{{\mu}$ \beqa \bar{{\delta}~v_+ &=&i\epsilon_- G_+ ,~~~~~~~~~~~~v_+ = 2\Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{+} X^{{\mu}\nonumber\\ \delta~v_- &=& i\epsilon_+ G_- ,~~~~~~~~~~~~v_- = 2\Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{-} X^{{\mu}. \eeqa Let us consider the second fermion symmetry of the action \beqa \begin{{array}{{llllll}\label{{newsusyII} \delta X^{{\mu} = -i\epsilon_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}~ ,\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} = -\epsilon_{{-}F^{{\mu} ,\\ \delta \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}=0,\\ \delta F^{{\mu} =  0,\\ \delta \Pi^{{\mu} = 0,\\ \delta \eta^{{\mu}_{{-} = 0 ,\\ \delta \eta^{{\mu}_{{+} =  2 \epsilon_{{-}\partial_{{+} \Pi^{{\mu}~ ,\\ \delta \Phi^{{\mu} = -2i  \epsilon_{{-}   \partial_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}, \end{{array}~~~~~ \begin{{array}{{lll} \bar{{\delta} X^{{\mu} = -i\epsilon_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-}~,\\ \bar{{\delta}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-} = 0,\\ \bar{{\delta }\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}= \epsilon_{{+}F^{{\mu} ,\\ \bar{{\delta} F^{{\mu} =  0,\\ \bar{{\delta} \Pi^{{\mu} =  0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-} =  2 \epsilon_{{+}\partial_{{-} \Pi^{{\mu}~ ~ ,\\ \bar{{\delta}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+} = 0 ,\\ \bar{{\delta} \Phi^{{\mu} = 2i  \epsilon_{{+}   \partial_{{-}\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}, \end{{array}~~~~ \begin{{array}{{lll} \delta \omega =  0,\\ \delta \xi_{{-} = -\epsilon_{{-}\omega,\\ \delta \xi_{{+} = 0 ,\\ \delta \Omega = i\epsilon_{{-}\xi_{{+},\\ \bar{{\delta}\omega = 0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\xi_{{-}= 0,\\ \bar{{\delta}\xi_{{+}=\epsilon_{{+}\omega,\\ \bar{{\delta}\Omega= i\epsilon_{{+}\xi_{{-}, \end{{array} \eeqa The  algebra of these fermionic symmetries is nilpotent and is very similar to BRST transformations \be\label{{brst2} \delta_{{\epsilon}\delta_{{\acute{{\epsilon}} ~ (H)  = \bar{{\delta}_{{\epsilon}\bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}}~ (H)= 0,~~~~~(\delta_{{\epsilon} \bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}} - \bar{{\delta}_{{\acute{{\epsilon}}\delta_{{\epsilon} )~ (H)=0. \ee where H is any of the fields $ (X,\Psi,F,\Pi,\eta,\Phi,\omega,\xi,\Omega)$. Let us compute  the corresponding current. The variation of the action is \beqa \delta{{S} = {{2\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~\{{-2 \Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{+}\partial_{{-}(-i\epsilon_{{-} \Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}) +2i\epsilon_{{-}\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}\partial_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+} +\nonumber\\ i\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{+}(-\epsilon_{{-}F^{{\mu}) -(1/2)F^{{\mu} (-2i\epsilon_{{-}\partial_{{+}\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}) \}= -{{2i\over \pi} \int d^{{2}\zeta ~Q_{{+}~ (\partial_{{-}\epsilon_{{-}) \eeqa and $Q_{{+} = 2\partial_{{+}\Pi^{{\mu}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+}$ also appeared in the previous section. The important fact now is that the energy momentum tensor is BRST commutator with respect to the second fermion symmetry \beqa \delta ~G_+   &=& \delta ~(2\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\partial_{{+}X^{{\mu})   = 2\epsilon_{{-} T_{{++},~~~~\nonumber\\ \delta ~G_-   &=& \delta ~(2\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\partial_{{-}X^{{\mu})   = 2\epsilon_{{+} T_{{--}, \eeqa and supercurrent $Q$ ia a variation of $U(1)$ current $J_a$ \beqa \delta ~J_+   &=& \delta ~(-\eta^{{\mu}_{{+}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{+})   = -\epsilon_{{-} Q_{{+},\nonumber\\ \delta ~J_-   &=& \delta ~(-\eta^{{\mu}_{{-}\Psi^{{\mu}_{{-})   = -\epsilon_{{+} Q_{{-} \eeqa Thus the energy momentum tensor is a BRST commutator $T_{{++} = \{{ Q_+ , G_+  \}$ and its central charge vanishes, the model transforms into topological theory.
