We construct analogs of the flat space Kaluza-Klein monopoles 
in locally Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces for $D \ge 5+1$.  We show 
that unlike the flat space KK monopole, 
there are no five dimensional static KK monopoles in AdS
space. Thus, one needs at least two extra 
dimensions, one of which is compact, to get a static KK monopole 
for cosmological backgrounds.
