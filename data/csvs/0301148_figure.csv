\caption{\sf
Plots of the ratio ${\sf Hess}_{\phi_\mu}(V_\mu,V_\mu)/||V_\mu||_{H^1}^2$ against
$\mu$ for the first excited state $V_\mu$ of the Sturm-Liouville problem
(\ref{sturm}) with $\phi_\mu:z\rightarrow\mu z^n$, $n=1,2,3,4$. To facilitate
comparison of the curves, in each case the ratio has been normalized by its
value at $\mu=1$ ($0.30$, $0.74$, $1.17$ and $1.55$ respectively, to 2
decimal places). Note that only for $n=1$ does the ratio tend to 0 as
$\mu\rightarrow\infty$.
