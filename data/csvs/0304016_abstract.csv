In this work we construct two classes of exact solutions for the most
general time-dependent Dirac Hamiltonian in 1+1 dimensions. Some problems
regarding to some formal solutions in the literature are discussed. Finally
the existence of a generalized Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant connected with
such solutions is discussed.
