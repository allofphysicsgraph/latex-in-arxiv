A remarkable feature of D-branes is the appearance of a nonabelian
gauge theory in the description of several (nearly) coincident branes.
This nonabelian structure plays an important role in realizing various
geometric effects with D-branes. In particular, the branes' transverse
displacements are described by matrix-valued scalar fields and so
noncommutative geometry naturally appears in this framework.
I review the action governing this
nonabelian theory, as well as various related physical phenomena such
as the dielectric effect, giant gravitons and fuzzy funnels.
