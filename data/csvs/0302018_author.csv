In this paper a
class of multi-Chern-Simons field theories which
is relevant  to the statistical mechanics of polymer systems is investigated.
Motivated by the problems which one encounters in the treatment of these
theories, a general procedure is presented to eliminate the Chern-Simons
fields from their
action. In this way it has been possible to derive an expression
of the partition function of topologically linked polymers which depends
explicitly on the topological numbers and does not have intractable
nonlocal terms as it happened in previous approaches.
The new formulation of multi-Chern-Simons field theories
is then used to remove and clarify
some inconsistencies and ambiguities which  apparently affect
field theoretical models of
topologically linked polymers.
Finally, the limit of disentangled polymers is discussed.

\section{Foreword}
In this paper we study abelian
multi-Chern-Simons field theories
\cite{Wen:uk,Frohlich:wb,Lee:fw,Birmingham:1991ty,
Wesolowski:1993yk}
coupled to
charged scalar fields.
Models of this kind find a natural application in the statistical
mechanics of  closed polymer rings
 subjected to topological constraints
\cite{Ferrari:ts}
and are
relevant in the phenomenology of the fractional quantum
Hall effect \cite{Cornalba:1997gh}.
An important feature of  these theories is that they exhibit
the phenomenon of charge confinement, which
occurs via a topological mechanism explained in
\cite{Cornalba:1997gh,deWildPropitius:1997wu}.
The aim of this work is to solve
some problems, discussed below,
which arise in the field theoretical formulation
 of polymer systems.

Let us suppose that there are $N$ polymers with trajectories
$P_1,\ldots,P_N$ in a dilute solution. The topological state of the system
is specified in such a way that each trajectory $P_i$ winds up
around trajectory $P_j$ a number $m_{ij}$ of times, $i>j=1,\ldots,N$.
In principle,
it would be desirable to write down an expression of the polymer partition
function which depends on the Gauss linking
 numbers $m_{ij}$'s. In practice, however, it is only
possible to compute the partition function in the space of the Fourier
conjugated
variables $\lambda_{ij}$'s \cite{FKLnpol}.
All attempts to go back to the space of the real topological numbers
$m_{ij}$ 
with
an inverse Fourier transformation led so far to  field theories with
intractable non-local terms \cite{FKLnpol, tanaka}.
Even in the investigation of
the simplest case in which all the polymers
are disentangled, i.e. $m_{ij}=0$ for $i,j=1,\ldots,N$, one encounters
tremendous complications, which can be overcome only resorting to mean-field
like approximations \cite{brerevilgis}.
Moreover, it is also
hard to give a physical meaning to the parameters
 $\lambda_{ij}$. 
At a first sight, in multi-Chern-Simons polymer models
they play the role of
coupling constants and determine the ``strength'' of the 
topological interactions which are necessary to keep the polymer trajectories
in the given topological state.
However, 
there is some freedom in the choice of the
domain in which these parameters are defined, so that
this interpretation cannot be correct.
For example, each $\lambda_{ij}$ can be defined in the interval
$[-\pi,\pi]$, but any other interval of the kind $[l\pi,(l+2)\pi]$,
where $l$ is an arbitrary integer, is also allowed due to the properties
of Fourier transformations. Clearly, from the point of
view of field theories, it makes a great difference if $l=1$ or if
$l>>1$. Furthermore, also the range $(-\infty,+\infty)$
is justified if one starts from a model of open polymers and then
recovers the limit of closed polymers requiring that the ends of the
polymers coincide.


Unfortunately, it is not an easy task
to obtain a reasonably simple expression of the polymer partition
function in terms of the physical parameters $m_{ij}$ and to remove
the above ambiguities.
One problem is that topological interactions in polymer systems
are governed by
 Chern-Simons fields and the contribution of these fields to the partition
function is hard to evaluate. First of all, it is not possible to proceed
perturbatively, since the values of the ``coupling constants'' $\lambda_{ij}$
are not small. On the other side, the action of Chern-Simons is intrinsecally
defined in three dimensions, so that it is difficult
to exploit techniques like the $\epsilon-$expansion which require
its
extension to arbitrary dimensions \cite{Chaichian:1998tf}.
%For instance, it is well known that the application
%to Chern-Simons based models of
%a powerful
%tool like the $\epsilon-$expansion
% may give inconsistent results \cite .
Also from the point of view of numerical
 simulations the situation is not better, since
the lattice formulation of Chern-Simons field theories
encountered so far many obstacles \cite{Bietenholz:2002mt,Berruto:2000dp}.

In order to solve these problems, 
we rewrite the action of
multi-Chern-Simons field theories
with the help of
a Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation and successively eliminate the Chern-Simons fields.
The resulting field theories
contain only scalar fields and
a set of auxiliary
fields which have no dynamics. 
The procedure used is quite general, although it has been developed
for the special multi-Chern-Simons field theories which are relevant to
polymers.
Exploiting the new formulation of the polymer partition function,
we are able to prove that there are not
ambiguities in the field theoretical description of polymer systems,
because all the possible domains in which the coupling constants
$\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_\Gamma$
may be
defined lead to equivalent models. Finally,
we clarify the physical meaning of these coupling constants: They play the
role of Lagrange multipliers. The constraints which they impose are explicitly
computed.

The material presented in this paper is divided as follows.
In Section 2 we consider an action with two Chern-Simons
fields coupled with multiplets of charged scalar fields which are 
invariant
under a $U(n_1)\times U(n_2)$ group of global symmetry.
The relations of this model with the statistical mechanics of two
topologically linked polymers have been
discussed in details in \cite{Ferrari:ts,Ferrari:yz} and
are here only briefly summarized.
Starting from this simple example of
multi-Chern-Simons field theories,
we illustrate the problems which arise in polymer models.
In Section 3 it is shown how it is possible to eliminate
the Chern-Simons fields using a suitable Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.
In this way we obtain an expression of the partition
function of polymers in terms of the topological numbers $m_{ij}$
in which the action is polynomial in the fields. In previous approaches,
instead, the action contained non-polynomial and non-local terms.
In Section 4
we check that the
non-uniqueness  of the domain of integration of the coupling constants
disappears
due to a symmetry which was hidden in the original formulation in terms
of Chern-Simons fields.
Finally, in Sections 5 and 6
these results are generalized to the case of multi-Chern-Simons
field theories describing the statistical mechanics of an arbitrary
number of polymers.


\section{The Two-Polymers Model}
Let us consider the action:
\begin{eqnarray}
S(\lambda)&=&
\int d^3x\left[ %\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}
\imath\kappa\mbox{\bf B}\cdot(\mbox{\boldmath $\nabla$}\times \mbox{\bf A})+
|(\mbox{\boldmath $\nabla$}-\imath\kappa\mbox{\bf B})\Psi_1|^2+m_1^2|\Psi_1|^2\right]  
\nonumber\\
&+&\int d^3x\left[|(\mbox{\boldmath $\nabla$}-\imath\lambda\mbox{\bf A})\Psi_2|^2+m_2^2|\Psi_2|^2\right]
\label{acttwo}
\end{eqnarray}
In Eq.~(\ref{acttwo}) $\imath=\sqrt{-1}$ and
the symbols $\Psi_i,\Psi_i^*$, $i=1,2$, denote
multiplets of charged fields:"
