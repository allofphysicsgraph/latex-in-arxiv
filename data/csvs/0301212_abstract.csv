Gravity coupled to an arbitrary number of antisymmetric tensors and scalar
fields in arbitrary space-time dimensions is studied in a context of
general, static, spherically symmetric solutions with many orthogonally
intersecting branes.  Neither supersymmetry nor harmonic gauge
is assumed.  It is shown that the system reduces to a Toda-like system
after an adequate redefinition of transverse radial coordinate $r$. 
Duality $r 
\rightarrow 1/r$ in the set of solutions is observed.
