In this paper I review some old and new works on the computation
of two-loop 4-particle amplitude in superstring theory. I also
present the proof  by Iengo, showing the vanishing of the term
related to the two-loop correction to the $R^4$ term. Finally I
will present some recent works on two-loop computation in
hyperelliptic language following the new gauging fixing method of
D'Hoker and Phong.
