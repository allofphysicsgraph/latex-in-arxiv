We find a new class of time-dependent brane solutions in supergravities
in arbitrary dimensions $D$. These are general intersecting light-like
branes (null-branes), and their superposition and intersection rules
are obtained. This is achieved by directly solving bosonic
field equations for supergravity coupled to a dilaton and antisymmetric
tensor fields. We discuss their possible significance.
