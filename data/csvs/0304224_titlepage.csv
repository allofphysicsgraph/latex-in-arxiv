{\bf Abstract}\\

\end{center}
We propose a new interpretation of the $c\!=\!1$ matrix model as the world-line theory of
$N$ unstable D-particles, in which the hermitian matrix is provided by the non-abelian
open string tachyon. For D-particles in 1+1-d string theory, we find a direct quantitative
match between the closed string emission due to a rolling tachyon
and that due to a rolling eigenvalue in the matrix model. We explain the origin
of the double-scaling limit, and interpret it as an extreme representative of
a large equivalence class of dual theories. Finally, we define a concrete
decoupling limit of unstable D-particles in IIB string theory that reduces to
the $c\! =\! 1$ matrix model, suggesting that 1+1-d string theory represents
the near-horizon limit of an ultra-dense gas of IIB D-particles.
