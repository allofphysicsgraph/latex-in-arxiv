A set of Markov processes corresponding to systems of
 hard-core particles interacting   along the line
are shown to be solvable via a dynamic matrix product
ansatz (DMPA). We show that quantum spin Hamiltonians
can be treated by the DMPA as well, and demonstrate how
the DMPA, originally formulated for systems with open 
ends,  works for periodic systems.
