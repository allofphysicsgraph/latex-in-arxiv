\item{the Casimir $C_2$ of the de Sitter isometry group ${\rm SO}(1,4)$, which measures the scalar mass spectrum in units of $\Lambda$  \cite{kallosh}, has an integer spectrum on the scalar excitations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle C_2\rangle = \frac{m^2}{H^2}=\frac{3\, m^2}{\Lambda}=k\in
\mathbb{Z}\,. \label{casimir}
\end{eqnarray}

\item{there was always a tachyon with $k=-6$ and therefore all these solutions were unstable \cite{kallosh:linde1}.}

\item{There have to exist vector fields transforming under $\mathcal{G}$ in the co--adjoint representation. They will become gauge vectors associated with the generators of $\mathcal{G}$}\item{Minimal couplings are introduced by substituting ordinary derivatives with covariant ones. A different coupling constant
$e_k$
 is associated with each simple factor in $\mathcal{G}$.}
\item{Supersymmetry invariance of the theory requires the addition to the action of fermion mass terms and of a scalar potential $V(\phi)\neq 0$ while the fermion supersymmetry transformations have to be modified by adding suitable shifts (fermion shifts).}

\item{Choice of a Special K{\""a}hler manifold of the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{M}_{SK}&=&\frac{{\rm SU}(1,1)}{{\rm U}(1)}\times\frac{{\rm
SO}(2,n-1)}{{\rm SO}(2)\times {\rm SO}(n-1)}
\end{eqnarray}
to parametrize using the Calabi--Vesentini coordinates
$\{z^\alpha\}=\{S,\,y^a\}$ ($a=0,\dots, n-2$) in terms of which the upper
and lower components of the symplectic section have the form:
\begin{eqnarray}
X^\Lambda(z^\alpha)&=&\left(\matrix{\frac{1}{2}(1+y^2)\cr \frac{{\rm
i}}{2}(1-y^2)\cr y^a }\right)\,;\,\,\,\,F_\Lambda(z^\alpha)=S \,
\eta_{\Lambda\Sigma}\,X^\Sigma\,;\nonumber\\
\eta_{\Lambda\Sigma}&=&{\rm diag}(+,+,\stackrel{n-1}{\overbrace{-,\dots,-
}})\, \,\,;\,\,\,\,y^2=(y^0)^2+\dots +(y^{n-2})^2\,.

\item{The presence in the gauge group $\mathcal{G}\subset\mathbb{G}={\rm SU}(1,1)\times {\rm SO}(2,n-1)$ of two simple factors $\mathcal{G}_0\times \mathcal{G}_1$  of which $\mathcal{G}_0$, with coupling constant $e_0$, has to be {\it non--compact} and {\it non--abelian} and $ \mathcal{G}_1$, with coupling constant $e_1$, has to admit a Fayet--Iliopoulos term. The only choice for $\mathcal{G}_0$ is ${\rm SO}(2,1)$ while $ \mathcal{G}_1$ can be either ${\rm U}(1)$ or ${\rm SO}(3)$. The F. I. term corresponding to $ \mathcal{G}_1$ has then to be added to the Lagrangian}
\item{Generalize the choice of the symplectic section by rotating the symplectic embedding of $\mathcal{G}_1$ with respect to $\mathcal{G}_0$. This is done
by means of a rotation ${\bf R}(\theta)$ which acts on the symplectic section $V(z)$ and has the  following properties:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf R}(\theta) \in {\rm Sp}(2n +2, \mathbb{R})/\mathbb{G}\,;\qquad {\bf
R}(\alpha)^{-1}\, \mathcal{G}\,{\bf R}(\theta)=\mathcal{G}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Since by construction ${\bf R}(\theta)$ is not in $\mathbb{G}$, its
effect is to map theories that are equivalent at the {\em ungauged}
level. A similar rotation was introduced by de Roo and Wagemans in the
context of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supergravity \cite{deRoo:Wagemans} to
generalize the construction of models with (unstable) de Sitter and
anti--de Sitter vacua.}
