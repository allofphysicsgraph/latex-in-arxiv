\vskip8mm

Bound and scattering state Schr\""odinger  functions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
as representation matrix elements of space and time
are embedded into residual representations of
spacetime as generalizations of Feynman propagators.
The representation invariants arise as singularities
of rational representation functions
in the complex energy and
complex momentum plane. The homogeneous space
$\GL(\C^2)/\U(2)$ with rank 2, the orientation manifold of the unitary
hypercharge-isospin group,
is taken as model of nonlinear spacetime. Its representations
are characterized by two continuous invariants whose ratio will be related to
gauge field coupling constants
as residues of the related representation functions. Invariants of product representations
define
unitary Poincar\'e group representations with masses for free particles
in  tangent Minkowski spacetime.
