Many solutions of General Relativity appear to allow the possibility of time travel.  This was initially a fascinating discovery, but geometries of this type violate causality, a basic physical law which is believed to be fundamental.  Although string theory is a proposed fundamental theory of quantum gravity, geometries with closed time-like curves have resurfaced as solutions to its low energy equations of motion.  In this paper, we will study the class of solutions to low energy effective supergravity theories related to the BMPV black hole and the rotating wave--D1--D5--brane system.   Time travel appears to be possible in these geometries.  We will attempt to build the causality violating regions and propose that stringy effects prohibit their construction.  The proposed chronology protection agent for these geometries mirrors a mechanism string theory employs to resolve a class of naked time-like singularities.
