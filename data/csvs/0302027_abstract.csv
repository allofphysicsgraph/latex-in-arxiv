We derive
anticommutators of supercharges 
with a brane charge 
for
a D-particle
 in  AdS$_2\times$S$^2$ and  pp-wave backgrounds.
A coset $GL(2{\mid}2)/(GL(1))^4$ and its Penrose limit are
used with the supermatrix-valued coordinates
for the AdS and the pp-wave spaces respectively.
The brane charges have position dependence, 
and can be absorbed into bosonic generators by shift of momenta
which results in closure of the superalgebras.
