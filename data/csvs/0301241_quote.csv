The standard quantum states of $n$ complex Grassmann variables with a
free-particle Lagrangian transform as a spinor of $SO(2n)$. However, the
same `free-fermion' model has a non-linearly realized $SU(n|1)$ symmetry;
it can be viewed as the mechanics of a `particle' on the Grassmann-odd
coset space $SU(n|1)/U(n)$. We implement a quantization of this model for
which the states with non-zero norm transform as a representation of
$SU(n|1)$, the representation depending on the $U(1)$ charge of
the wave-function. For $n=2$ the wave-function can be interpreted
as a BRST superfield.
