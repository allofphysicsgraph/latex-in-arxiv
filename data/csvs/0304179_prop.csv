6,"\begin{prop} The reflection of an interior point about a secant
line coincides with the reflection of the same interior point about 
an exterior point. Moreover, since any motion of the hyperbolic plane 
is a product of line reflections about secant lines, any motion of the 
hyperbolic plane is generated by reflections about exterior points.
