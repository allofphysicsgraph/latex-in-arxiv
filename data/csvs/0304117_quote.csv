4D Einstein gravity coupled to scalars and abelian gauge fields 
in its 2-Killing vector reduction is shown to be quasi-renormalizable 
to all loop orders at the expense of introducing infinitely many 
essential couplings. 
The latter can be combined into one or two functions of the `area 
radius' associated with the two Killing vectors. The renormalization 
flow of these couplings 
is governed by beta functionals expressible in closed form 
in terms of the (one coupling) beta function of a symmetric space 
sigma-model. Generically the matter coupled systems are asymptotically 
safe, that is the flow possesses a non-trivial UV stable fixed point 
at which the trace anomaly vanishes. The main exception is a minimal 
coupling of 4D Einstein gravity to massless free scalars, 
in which case the scalars decouple from gravity at the fixed point.
