We study the unitarity bounds of the scattering amplitudes in 
 the 
 extra dimensional gauge theory 
 where the gauge symmetry is broken by the boundary 
 condition. 
The estimation of the amplitude of 
 the diagram including four massive gauge 
 bosons in the external lines 
 shows that the asymptotic power behavior of the 
 amplitude is canceled. 
The calculation will be done 
 in the 5 dimensional 
 standard model and the $SU(5)$ grand unified theory, 
 whose 5th dimensional coordinate 
 is compactified 
 on $S^1/Z_2$. 
The broken gauge theories through 
 the orbifolding preserve the 
 unitarity at high energies 
 similarly to 
 the broken gauge theories 
 where the gauge bosons obtain their 
 masses through the Higgs mechanism. 
We show that the contributions of 
 the Kaluza-Klein states
 play a crucial 
 role in conserving the unitarity.
