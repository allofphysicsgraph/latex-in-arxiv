\noindent 
We construct the cubic interaction vertex and dynamically
generated supercharges in light-cone superstring field theory for a large class
half-supersymmetric D-branes in the plane-wave background. We show that these satisfy
the plane-wave superalgebra at first order in string coupling. 
The cubic interaction vertex and dynamical supercharges presented here are given explicitly
in terms of oscilators and can be used to compute three-point functions of open
strings with endpoints on half-supersymmetric D-branes.
