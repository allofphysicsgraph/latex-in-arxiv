This paper discusses Skyrmions on the $3$-sphere coupled to
fermions. The resulting Dirac equation commutes with a generalized angular
momentum ${\bf G}$. For $G = 0$ the Dirac equation can be solved
explicitly for a constant Skyrme configuration and also for a
$SO(4)$ symmetric hedgehog configuration. 
We discuss how the spectrum changes due to the presence of a non-trivial 
winding number, and also consider more general Skyrme configurations 
numerically.
