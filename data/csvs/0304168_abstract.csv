We study cosmological solutions to the low-energy effective action of heterotic
string theory including possible leading order $\alpha'$ corrections and a potential
for the dilaton. We consider the possibility that including such stringy corrections can 
resolve the initial cosmological singularity. Since the exact form
of these corrections is not known the higher-derivative terms are constructed so that they vanish
only when the metric is de Sitter spacetime. The constructed terms
are compatible with known restrictions from scattering amplitude and string worldsheet
beta-function calculations. Analytic and numerical techniques
are used to construct a singularity-free cosmological solution. At late times and 
low-curvatures the metric is asymptotically Minkowski and
the dilaton is frozen. In the high-curvature regime the universe enters a de Sitter phase.
