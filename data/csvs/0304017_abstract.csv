The ``little group'' for massless particles (namely, the Lorentz
transformations $\Lambda$ that leave a null vector invariant) is
isomorphic to the Euclidean group E2: translations and rotations
in a plane. We show how to obtain explicitly the rotation angle of
E2 as a function of $\Lambda$ and we relate that angle to Berry's
topological phase. Some particles admit both signs of helicity,
and it is then possible to define a reduced density matrix for their
polarization. However, that density matrix is physically meaningless,
because it has no transformation law under the Lorentz group, even
under ordinary rotations.
