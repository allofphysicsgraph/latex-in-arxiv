\caption{\label{diagram}Schematic diagram displaying positronium dynamics in an 
intense laser field. The bound system depicted by the density of its 
wave function may ionize in the laser field. Once free, both electron $e$ and 
positron $p$ could be described as classical particles. Their trajectories are 
shown by the solid lines. The electric field ${\bf E}$ accelerates both particles in
opposite directions while the Lorentz force due to the magnetic field ${\bf H}$
leads to an identical drift in the propagation direction ${\bf k_L}$. Without an initial
center-of-mass motion these trajectories are symmetric and thus both particles
overlap periodically giving rise to possible recombinations and annihilations and thus
high-frequency light emission.

in a laser pulse with vector potential $A=194.0$a.u. and angular frequency $\omega=0.0091$a.u. 
(corresponding to a laser intensity of 8.5 $\times 10^{12}$ W/cm${^2}$
and the second harmonic of a CO$_2$ laser with wavelenth 10 $\mu m$) and pulse shape parameters $c_1=1.0$ and $c_2=5.0$.
The symbols $c_1$ and $c_2$ denote the  number of cycles of ${\rm sin}^2$ turn-on/turn-off phases and of the intermediate cycles at full amplitude, respectively. The initial positronium velocity is
for a) $V_x=V_z=0.0001$a.u. and for b) $V_x=V_z=13.7$a.u. corresponding to 10$\%$ of the speed of 
light.

Feynman diagrams displaying $\gamma$-photon emission via electron-positron annihilation by 
a) multiphoton annihilation in super strong laser fields at $\xi \gtrsim 100$ with emission of 
$n\gtrsim 10^{6}$ laser photons along with one $\gamma $-quantum; 
b) annihilation in a laser field at $\xi \ll 100$ with emission of laser photons along with two
$\gamma $-quanta; 
c) annihilation of ortho-positronium with emission of three photons without laser field.
Bold lines correspond to the electron (positron) Volkov states, i.e. in the presence of the laser field,
dashed lines to the emitted  photons.}
