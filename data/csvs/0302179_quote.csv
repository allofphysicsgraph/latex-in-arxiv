In this paper, the BRST symmetry transformation is presented for
the noncommutative $U(N)$ gauge theory. The nilpotency of the
charge associated to this symmetry is then proved. As a
consequence for the space-like non-commutativity parameter, the
Hilbert space of physical states is determined by the cohomology
space of the BRST operator as in the commutative case. Further,
the unitarity of the S-matrix elements projected onto the
subspace of physical states is deduced.
