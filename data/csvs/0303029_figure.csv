\caption{
The top two panels show the behaviour of the $n=5$ and $n=10$ QNM
frequencies in the complex $\omega$ plane. The $n=10$ mode ``spirals
in'' towards its value in the extremal charge limit; the number of
spirals described by each mode increases roughly as the mode order
$n$. The panels in the second row show how the $n=10$ spiral
``unwinds'' as the angular index $l$ is increased (in other words, the
asymptotic behaviour sets in later for larger $l$'s). Finally, the
bottom panel shows a high-$l$ mode trajectory ``pointing'' to its
limit as the charge becomes extremal. In all cases, we have marked by
an arrow the frequency corresponding to the Schwarzschild limit
($Q=0$).

Real part of the RN QNM frequencies as a function of charge for
$n=5,~10,~30,~60,~5000,~10000,~100000$. As the mode order increases
the computation becomes more and more time consuming, the oscillations
become faster, and a good numerical sampling is rather difficult to
achieve; therefore in the last plot we use different symbols (small
squares, circles and triangles) to display the actually computed
points. For $n=5000,~10000,~100000$ we also compare to the prediction
of the analytic formula (\ref{MNf}) derived by Motl and Neitzke
\cite{MN}. The oscillatory behaviour is reproduced extremely well by
their formula, but the disagreement increases for small charge:
formula (\ref{MNf}) does not yield the correct Schwarzschild limit.

extremely well, but the disagreement with our numerical data increases
for small charge.

The left panel corresponds to $l=3,~n=15$ and the right panel to

in the RN case. We have marked by an arrow the point in the plane

Relative error in the formula for the asymptotic frequency conjectured
by Hod. The plots shows $E=(\omega_R-\tilde \omega_R)/\tilde
\omega_R$, where $\tilde \omega_R$ is defined in formula (\ref{conj}),
for increasing values of the mode index $n$, namely $n=12,~30,~40,~50$

asymptotic formula tends to be larger and larger.
