   \item{}Each null membrane is considered as a universe that satisfy the cosmological principle during its evolution.  If the RHS of (\ref{5}) is zero, then the universes are causally disconnected.

   \item{}If (\ref{5}) is different from zero, then the universes interact harmonically implying infrared-ultraviolet shifts. The periodic fluctuations of the universe could be a source of anisotropy, maybe, it could explain the presently observed anisotropy.

   \item{}The periodic motion among universes is a source of gravitational waves with frequencies extremely tiny. 
   
    \item{} The noncommutativity is an effect that could be attributed to a primordial magnetic field.
