An exact representation of the Euclidean fermion determinant in two
dimensions for centrally symmetric, finite-ranged Abelian background
fields is derived. Input data are the wave function inside the field's
range and the scattering phase shift with their momenta rotated to the
positive imaginary axis and fixed at the fermion mass for each
partial-wave. The determinant's asymptotic limit for strong coupling
and small fermion mass for square-integrable, unidirecitonal magnetic
fields is shown to depend only on the chiral anomaly. The concept of
duality is extended from one to two-variable fields, thereby relating
the two-dimensional Euclidean determinant for a class of background
magnetic fields to the pair production probability in four dimensions
for a related class of electric pulses. Additionally, the
``diamagnetic'' bound on the two-dimensional Euclidean determinant is
related to the negative sign of
$\partial \text{Im}S_{\text{eff}}/\partial m^2$ in four dimensions in
the strong coupling, small mass limit, where $S_{\text{eff}}$ is the
one-loop effective action.
