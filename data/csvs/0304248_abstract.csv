We consider a toy metric in four dimensional space-time defined in terms
of a recursive hierarchical prescription. The matter distribution turns
out to be extremely inhomogeneous. Surprisingly, for very large samples
the average mass density tends (very slowly) to a constant. There is
no trace of fractal dimension left.
