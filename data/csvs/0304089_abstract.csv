M-theory compactifies on a seven-dimensional time-dependent hyperbolic or flat
space to a four-dimensional FLRW cosmology undergoing a period of accelerated
expansion in Einstein conformal frame. The strong energy condition is violated
by the scalar fields produced in the compactification, as is necessary to evade
the no-go theorem for time-independent compactifications. The four-form field
strength of eleven-dimensional supergravity smoothly switches on during the
period of accelerated expansion in hyperbolic compactifications, whereas in
flat compactifications, the three-form potential smoothly changes its sign.
For small acceleration times, this behaviour is like a phase transition of the
three-form potential, during which the cosmological scale factor approximately
doubles.
