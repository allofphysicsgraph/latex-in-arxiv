The decay constant of the QCD axion is required by observation to
be small compared to the Planck scale. In theories of ``natural
inflation,"" and certain proposed anthropic solutions of the
cosmological constant problem, it would be interesting to obtain a {\it
large} decay constant for axion-like fields
from microscopic physics. String theory is
the only context in which one can sensibly address this question.
Here we survey a number of periodic fields in string
theory in a variety of string vacua.
In some examples, the decay constant {\it can} be parameterically
larger than the Planck scale
but the effective action then contains appreciable harmonics of order
$f_A/M_p$.  As a result, these fields are no better inflaton candidates
than Planck scale axions.
