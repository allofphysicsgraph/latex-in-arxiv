$\left \langle R^{(2)}(z_{2})\Phi^{q*}(z_{3})R^{(1)}(z_{1}) \right \rangle$

Here, $R^{(1)}(z_{1})$ is a disorder operator whose module is
supposed to be completely degenerate at level 1/2, i.e.,
$R^{(1)}(z_{1})=\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1,2)(1,\ldots,1)} (z_{1})$ or
$\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,2)}(z_{1})$. The operator
$R^{(2)}(z_{2})$ is a generic disorder operator, and
$\Phi^{q*}(z_{3})$ with $q^*=0,\pm r^*$ is a singlet or a doublet
$r^*$ operator (we remind that $r^*$ is the $Z_N$ charge in the notation
(\ref{Qnotation})).

The necessary condition for the
above function  to be non-zero is given by the following equation
on the dimensions of the operators $R^{(1)}$, $R^{(2)}$ and $\Phi^{q*}$:
\beq
 \Delta_{R^{(2)}}-\Delta_{\Phi^{q*}}+\frac{1}{(N-1)}
 \left(1-\frac{2}{N}\delta_{q^*,r^*}\right)
 \Delta_{R^{(1)}}=
 (-1)^{\delta_{q^*,r^*}}\frac{N}{N-1}\frac{h^{(2)}_{1}}{h^{(1)}_{1}}
 \Delta_{R^{(1)}}.
 \label{char0}
\eeq
The values  $h^{(1)}_{1}$ and $h^{(2)}_{1}$ are the zero mode
eigenvalues of the operators $R^{(1)}$ and $R^{(2)}$, as defined in
Eq.~(\ref{Rzero1}). While  $h^{(1)}_{1}$  has been  fixed by the
computations presented in Section~2, we do not know the eigenvalue
$h^{(2)}_{1}$ for a generic disorder operator. If we set
$R^{(2)}=\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1,2)(1,\ldots,1)}$ or
$R^{(2)}=\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,2)}$, the eigenvalue
$h_{1}^{(2)}$ in Eq.~(\ref{char0}) is known and the dimension
$\Delta_{\Phi^{q*}}$ can be easily calculated for each of the two
channels $q^*=0$ and $q^*=r^*$.

Let us discuss, for example, the case
$R^{(1)}=R^{(2)}=\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,2)}$. In this case we
obtain:
\beq
 \Delta_{\Phi^{0}}=\Delta_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1)}=0,
 \qquad \Delta_{\Phi^{r*}}=\Delta_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,3)}.
\eeq
This  result is in agreement both with the fact that
$\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,3)}$ was deduced to be a doublet $r^*$, see
Eq.~(\ref{posconj}), and with the value of the boundary term
$B_{D^{r*}}=(N-1)/8N $. Note also that the
Coulomb gas fusin rules are well respected. Indeed, as discussed previously,
we expect that the fusion $\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,2)} \cdot
\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,2)}$
produces in the principal channel the operator with
$\vec{\beta}_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,3)}=
 \vec{\beta}_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,2)}+
 \vec{\beta}_{(1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1,2)}$.
The $q^*=0$ channel, corresponding to the identity operator, follows the
principal one by a shift
realised by the combination $-\sum_{k=1}^{r} k\vec{e}_{k}$ of
screening vectors.

Actually, even when $h_{1}^{(2)}$ is unknown, we can still do some amount of
verification by using Eq.~(\ref{char0}). Indeed, one of the two channels of
this equation could be used to define $h^{(2)}_{1}$, by assuming a given value
of $\Delta_{\Phi^{0}}$ for instance, chosen at a particular position in the
Kac table. The other channel, with $\Phi^{r*}$, in which enters the same
$h^{(2)}_{1}$, could then serve to check for the presence of
$\Delta_{\Phi^{r*}}$ at the appropriate position in the Kac table, having the
value calculated from the characteristic equation (\ref{char0}). We have in
this way verified the compatibility of the theory with Eq.~(\ref{char0}).

\item $\left \langle \Phi^{r}_{(2)}\Phi^{0}\Phi^{-r}_{(1)}
 \right \rangle$

The module of the operator $\Phi^{-r}_{(1)}$ is supposed to be degenerate at
levels $\delta_{r-1}^{r}$ and $1$, i.e.,
$\Phi^{-r}_{(1)}=\Phi_{(2,1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1)}$ or
$\Phi^{-r}_{(1)}=\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2,1,\ldots,1)}$ (see Section~2).
We derive the following equation for the dimensions:
\beq
 \Delta_{\Phi^{0}}-\Delta_{\Phi^{r}_{(2)}}-\frac{1}{N-1}
 \Delta_{\Phi^{r}_{(1)}}=
 -\frac{N}{N-1}\frac{h^{(2)}_{1}}{h^{(1)}_{1}}\Delta_{\Phi^{r}_{(1)}},
 \label{char1}
\eeq
where $h^{(2)}_{1}$ and $h^{(1)}_{1}$ are respectively the eigenvalues
of the operators $\Phi^{r}_{(2)}$ and $\Phi^{-r}_{(1)}$, as defined in
Eq.~(\ref{zeroeigen}).

We consider the operators $\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n,1,\ldots,1)}$ and
$\Phi_{(2n,1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1)}$, with $n$ integer.
The above operators have $Z_N$ charge $q=r$, as it can be seen
from Eq.~(\ref{filling}). We know from the reflection-type arguments
that these operators are degenerate at level $\delta_{r-1}^{r}$. If we set
$\Phi^{r}_{(2)}= \Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n,1,\ldots,1)}$  or
$\Phi^{r}_{(2)}= \Phi_{(2n,1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1)}$, then the
correspondent eigenvalue $h^{(2)}_{1}$ is determined by
Eq.~(\ref{fixeig2}). In this case, Eq.~(\ref{char1}) has
respectively the solutions:
\beq
 \Delta_{\Phi^{0}}=\Delta_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n-1,1,\ldots,1)} \mbox{ and }
 \Delta_{\Phi^{0}}=\Delta_{(2n-1,1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1)}.
\eeq
We conclude that the singlets $\Phi_{(2n-1,1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1)}$
and $\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n-1,1,\ldots,1)}$ are produced in a non principal
channel of the fusion
$\Phi^{r}_{(2)}\cdot\Phi^{-r}_{(1)}$. This is in agreement with the
Coulomb gas rules and with the filling of the weight lattice that we have
given previously.

\item $\left \langle \Phi^{r}_{(2)}\Phi^{1}\Phi^{r}_{(1)}
 \right \rangle.$

In the above function we suppose
$\Phi^{r}_{(1)}=\Phi_{(2,1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1)}$ or
$\Phi^{r}_{(1)}=\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2,1,\ldots,1)}$, and
$\Phi^{r}_{(2)}=\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n,1,\ldots,1)}$ or
$\Phi^{r}_{(2)}=\Phi_{(2n,1,\ldots,1)(1,\ldots,1)}$.
Taking into account that the modules of these
operators are degenerate at level $\delta_{r-1}^{r}$, we obtain the
characteristic equation:
\beq
 \Delta_{\Phi^{1}}=\Delta_{\Phi^{r}_{(2)}}+\frac{N-3}{N-1}
 \Delta_{\Phi^{r}_{(1)}}.
 \label{char2}
\eeq
Once again, the above equation is consistent with the theory. For
example, if we consider the fusion
$\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2,1,\ldots,1)}\cdot\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n,1,\ldots,1)}$
we have from Eq.~(\ref{char2}) that
\beq
 \Delta_{\Phi^{1}}=\Delta_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n-1,2,1,\ldots,1)}.
\eeq
The doublet 1 operator $\Phi_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n-1,2,1,\ldots,1)}$
is expected to be produced in a non-principal channel of the
fusion considered above, since
\beq
 \vec{\beta}_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n-1,2,1,\ldots,1)}=
 \vec{\beta}_{(1,\ldots,1)(2,1,\ldots,1)}+
 \vec{\beta}_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n,1,\ldots,1)}-\vec{e}_1.
\eeq
The placing of the doublet $1$ operator at the position
$\vec{\beta}_{(1,\ldots,1)(2n-1,2,1,\ldots,1)}$
is confirmed by the above result.
