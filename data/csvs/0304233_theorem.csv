$bc$-type, the billiard is the fundamental Weyl chamber of the
Kac-Moody algebra ${\cal F}^{\wedge \wedge}$ (overextension of the
maximal split subalgebra ${\cal F}$);

(ii) If the restricted root system is $bc_r$, the billiard is the
fundamental Weyl chamber of the Kac-Moody algebra
$A_{2r}^{(2)\wedge}$.
