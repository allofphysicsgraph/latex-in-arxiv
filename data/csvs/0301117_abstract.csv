After a pedagogical review of elementary cosmology,
I go on to discuss some obstacles to obtaining
inflationary  or accelerating universes in M/String Theory.
In particular, I  give an account of an old ``No-Go Theorem''
to this effect.
I then   describe some recent ideas about the
possible r\^ole
of the tachyon in cosmology. I stress that
there are many objections  to a naive inflationary  model
based on the tachyon, but
there remains the possiblity that the tachyon
was important in a possible pre-inflationary
``Open-String Era '' preceeding our present ``Closed String Era''.
