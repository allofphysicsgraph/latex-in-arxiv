0,"\begin{eqnarray*}
n(t)&=&n_0(t)+n_1(t)+n_2(t)+\ldots
\\
&=&
n_0(t)+ 4\pi \int_0^{t}n_{0}(t')(t-t')^2 dt'
+ 4\pi \int_0^{t}n_{1}(t')(t-t')^2 dt'+\ldots
\\
&=&
n_0(t)+ 4\pi \int_0^{t}[n_0(t')+n_1(t')+n_2(t')+\ldots](t-t')^2 dt'
\end{eqnarray*}
Or:
\begin{equation}\label{eq7}
n(t)=4\pi t^2+ 4\pi\int_0^{t}n(t')(t-t')^2 dt'
\end{equation}

Calculating the third derivative over $t$ of $n(t)$ defined by eq. (\ref{eq7}),
we get the equivalent differential equation:
\begin{equation}\label{eq8}
n'''(t)=8\pi n(t)
\end{equation}
with the initial conditions:
     \begin{equation}\label{eq8a}
n(0)=0,\quad n'(0)=0,\quad n''(0)=8\pi.
     \end{equation}
The solution of eq. (\ref{eq8}) satisfying the initial conditions (\ref{eq8a})
has the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq8b}
n(t)=\frac{2\pi^{1/3}}{3}\exp(2 \pi^{1/3} t)
-\frac{2\pi^{1/3}}{3}\exp(- \pi^{1/3} t)\left[\cos(\sqrt{3}\pi^{1/3} t)
+\sqrt{3}\sin(\sqrt{3}\pi^{1/3} t)\right],
\end{equation}
that can be checked by the direct substitution.

The decomposition of (\ref{eq8b}) in the Taylor series reads:
$$
n(t)=4\pi t^2+ (4\pi)^2\frac{t^5}{30} +(4\pi)^3\frac{t^8}{5040}+\ldots
$$
that indeed coincides with the sum $n(t)=n_0(t)+n_1(t)+n_2(t)+\ldots$.


Now we calculate $k(t)=\sum_k k n_k(t)$.
Namely, according to eq. (\ref{eq5}), $n(t)$ is given by the sum:
$$
n(t)= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}  c_{k} t^{2+3k}
$$
and similarly for $k(t)$:
$$
k(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}  k n_k(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k c_{k} t^{2+3k}.
$$
Calculating the first derivative of $n(t)$ over $t$, we get:
$$
n'(t)= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (2+3k) c_{k} t^{2+3k-1}=
\frac{2}{t}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_{k}  t^{2+3k}
+\frac{3}{t}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k c_{k} t^{2+3k}
=\frac{2}{t}n(t)+\frac{3}{t}k(t).
$$
That is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq9}
k(t)=\frac{1}{3}\left[t n'(t)-2n(t)\right]
\end{equation}
    From (\ref{eq0}) and (\ref{eq9}) we find $\bar{k}(t)$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq10}
\bar{k}(t)=\sum_k k w_k(t)=\frac{\sum_k k n_k(t)}{n(t)}=
\frac{k(t)}{n(t)}=\frac{1}{3}\left[\frac{t n'(t)}{n(t)}-2\right].
\end{equation}
Substituting here, for $t\to \infty$, the leading term of the
expression (\ref{eq8b}) for $n(t)$:
$$
n(t)|_{t\to\infty}\approx\frac{2\pi^{1/3}}{3}\exp(2 \pi^{1/3} t)
$$
we get:
$$
\bar{k}(t)|_{t\to\infty}=\frac{2\pi^{1/3}}{3}t.
$$
For large $t$,  the average number of events linearly increases
with $t$, like for the Poisson distribution.

The average time between events is
$$
\bar{t}=\frac{t}{\bar{k}(t)}=\frac{3}{2\pi^{1/3}}.
$$

    From here we obtain the average distance between two events
$\bar{r}=c\bar{t}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq11}
\bar{r}=\frac{3}{2\pi^{1/3}} \ell_0.
\end{equation}
Numerically it gives:
$$
\bar{r}=1.02418 \,\ell_0,
$$
a value close to the Compton length.

\section{Conclusions}
In conclusion, the following remarks seem relevant.

     It turned out that we had to suppose that the scattering
     wave v.s. the distance $r$ from the scattering center be decreased
as $1/r$, eq. (\ref{rw1}).
     It looks like the diffusion of a spherical wave which seems  natural,
but, at first glance, it has no any hint to relativity.
However, if, instead of $1/r$, we would take another function of $r$, we
would not reproduce the propagator, but also would loose the relativistic
invariance. In this case we would obtain an expression depending on $t$ and
$r$ taken separately, not in the invariant combination $\tau^2=t^2-r^2$.
This ``no choice'' seems unexpected and intriguing.

      On the other hand, in the stochastic motion of our particle, at each
change of its direction, we supposed that its scattering mimics
resonance S-wave scattering with an amplitude $f=-1$ and a $ \pi/2
$ phase shift. One can say that the ""scatterings"" which result in
the propagator take place at very small distances, so that higher
partial waves are suppressed.


     Moreover it is interesting to compare the 1-D case with the 3-D one.
     In the 1-D case the average path
between events was found to be exactly the Compton length
$\ell_0$, whereas in this 3-D study it gets
$\dfrac{3}{2\pi^{1/3}}\ell_0 \approx 1.02418 \,\ell_0$. This gives
an example, how a  fundamental characteristic of elementary
particle can be calculated and expressed through simple  numbers,
like $2,3,\pi, \ldots$. Other examples can be found in
\cite{P.Noyes}.

    We have clearly shown that the model is very constrained by our
assumptions. We
think that obtaining the same propagator for the particle as in
standard  quantum
fields theory is not a pure accident. For sure, one should try to find
out physical reasons resulting in the scatterings of the propagating particle
on its path. As already said, some  hypothesis have been advanced in many
papers but it was, at present, beyond the scope of this work.  It would be also
interesting to see how to introduce the spin property in our 3-D model .

We can also,
obtain the integral
equation for the sum $S(\tau)=I_2(\tau)+I_3(\tau)+I_4(\tau)+\ldots$,
using the recurrence relation (\ref{rw5}):
$$
S(\tau)=I_2 -\frac{1}{\ell_{0}^{2}} \int_{0}^{\tau}
S\bigl({{\tau^{\prime}}}\bigr)\dfrac{(\tau^{2}-
{\tau^{\prime}}^{2})}{2 \tau^{2}}\tau^{\prime}\text{d} {\tau^{\prime}}
$$
It is easy to check that the function $-4\pi\ell_{0}\tau S(\tau)$
satisfies the equation for the Bessel function
$J_{1}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ell_{0}}\right)$, that is:
$$
S(\tau)=-\frac{1}{4\pi{\ell_{0}}^{2}}
\frac{\ell_{0}}{\tau} J_{1}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ell_{0}}\right)
$$
that again gives the equation (\ref{rw5c})."
