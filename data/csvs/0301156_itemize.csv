\item{Adding solutions to concrete problems (which cannot even be
respectably addressed in the conventional HS formalism) to the RHS's
formal achievements in the area of intrinsic irreversibility
(including intrinsic irreversibility on the microphysical
level~\cite{qat1,qat2,qat3}).}
\item{Demonstrating how it is possible using our variant of
the RHS quantum formalisms
to incorporate genuine mathematical hyperbolicity into quantum
dynamics.  This leads to notions of quantum dynamics which have
attributes analogous to the non-linear dynamics, chaos, fractals,
etc., of the contemporary dynamical systems literature.  This is
categorically incompatible with von Neumann's HS formalism.}
\item{The variant of the RHS formalism which we adopt admits a field
theory interpretation, and from the dynamics alone of 2, 3 and 4
correlated fields respectively.}
\item{We will require a complex plane structure in our ring of
  scalars, making the algebraic field $\C$ unsuitable for technical
  mathematical reasons, including uniqueness.  This will be covered in
  length in installment two~\cite{II}.}
