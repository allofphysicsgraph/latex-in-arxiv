\caption{ Plot showing $K$, the scalar curvature invariant, measured from the string ($\lambda = 3.9$) compared to the cone prediction. The ratio is also shown, and we see good agreement slightly away from the apex, where finite $\lambda$ `resolves' the cone. Moving far from the cone ie. $z<2.1$ or $r>0.4$ the cone is no longer a good approximation, the actual curvature becoming more homogeneous in $z$.

\caption{ Plots of $\sin{\chi}$ on the $z = L_n$ axis measured from string solutions with $\lambda = 1.5, 3.9$. For the larger $\lambda$ we see the curve become more `constant', and furthermore, the value is remarkably consistent with one, the cone prediction.

\caption{ Plots of remaining metric components $c1, c2$ computed from the numerical solution with $\lambda = 3.9$ using the `corrected' $\sin{\chi}$. The cone predicts that $c1 = c2 = e^{2 B}$ which is also plotted for comparison. Very good agreement is seen, given that the underlying data is on a lattice of only approximately $20*20$ and resolution effects may give significant numerical errors.

  The off-diagonal metric component $c3$ which the cone predicts to be
  zero. Away from the resolved apex, we see it is indeed much smaller
  than the values of $c1, c2$ in the previous plot, again being
  consistent with the cone ansatz.
