the winding around the asymptotic circle of the cigar. This translates
to the restriction $\frac{M+\bar{M}}{k}$ is an integer $n-w$.  We will
also see that correlation functions depend only on this combination,
and not on $n$ and $w$ separately. We conclude therefore that without
loss of generality one can start with the unflowed representations of
\ensuremath{S\!L(2,\mathbb{R})}\ --- the winding will be generated using the compact scalar
$\phi$ \footnote{This construction of vertex operators of $\ensuremath{S\!L(2,\mathbb{R})}$, was
sketched in \cite{MO3}, using the language of parafermions, where the
last fact is more transparent.}.

The vertex operator has conformal weights (with respect to the
unflowed $L_0, \bar{L_0}$),
\begin{eqnarray}
    h_{J p n } & = & -\frac{J(J-1)}{k-2} + \frac{(p + nk)^2}{4k},
    \nonumber\\ \bar h_{J p n } & = & -\frac{J(J-1)}{k-2} + \frac{(p -
    n k)^2}{4k},
\end{eqnarray}
where we denote $p=m-\bar{m}$ to be the momentum around the asymptotic
circle. This is the spectrum found in \cite{DVV}.  Note that it is the
Casimir operator with restricted domain which appears in the mass
formulas,
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta = L_0 + \bar{L_0} - 1 &=& -\frac{J(J-1)}{k-2} +
    \frac{p^2}{2k}+ \frac{kn^2}{2}, \nonumber\\
         L_0 - \bar{L_0} &=& pn.
\end{eqnarray}
This justifies the interpretation of $p$, $n$ as momentum and winding,
respectively, around the Euclidean time direction.

We are interested in exploring correlators as a function of the
Euclidean momentum $p$. It is therefore essential not to restrict the
possible values of $p$. For that reason we choose $n=0$; otherwise the
level matching condition will make it difficult to construct a series
of allowed vertex operators with the different momenta, to be
interpreted as Fourier modes of a single object\footnote{Such vertex
operators will have to involve oscillator excitations which are
left-right asymmetric, and generally carry spacetime quantum numbers.}.
It may be expected that the set of observables does not change at
finite temperature, and the quantum number $n$ has no clear zero
temperature limit in the boundary theory.

However, we will see that the set of observables with $n=0$ does not
allow exploration of all possible momenta (for finite $k$). This is
essentially due to the same bound on the allowed off-shell momenta
found in \cite{gk}. In the present context, this puzzle may eventually
be resolved by making use of observables with $n \neq 0$.  We comment
further on this point below.

We therefore choose to work with graviton vertex operators, which in
addition to the wave function in the $\ensuremath{S\!L(2,\mathbb{R})}/U(1)$ part have oscillator
excitations in the left and right moving sectors of the free CFT on
$\mathbb{R}^5$. The $\mathbb{S}^3$ part remains in its ground state.

\subsection{Worldsheet Supersymmetry}

To supersymmetrize the theory, eight Majorana-Weyl fermions are added
to each sector of the model. These fermions are free after a suitable
chiral rotation.

The addition of fermions changes the scaling dimension of vertex
operators. Since the zero point energy on the world-sheet is altered,
the term $\frac{2J(J-1)}{k(k-2)}$ is added to both $h_{Jpn}$ and $\bar
h_{Jpn}$ so that this scaling becomes
\begin{equation}
    h_{J p n } = -\frac{J(J-1)}{k} + \frac{(p + nk)^2}{4k}
\end{equation}
and likewise for $\bar h_{J p n }$.

The GSO projection used here breaks spacetime supersymmetry because it
imposes different periodicity conditions on spacetime bosons and
fermions around the compact Euclidean time direction. Spacetime
fermions are anti-periodic while bosons are periodic.

Requiring spacetime fermions to be anti-periodic, together with
modular invariance, introduces new phase factors into the sum over
spin structures. This was done by Atick and Witten \cite{AW} using the
functions $U_i(p, n)$, which modify the usual phases of Type II
strings at zero temperature. Explicitly\footnote{We are using here
the flat space result since we will be mainly interested in the
leading results in the large $k$ limit, and in the limit $k\rightarrow
\infty$ one recovers a flat space.}, these four functions are
\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
    U_1(p,n) &=& \frac{1}{2}\left(-1 + (-1)^p + (-1)^n + (-1)^{p+n}\right), \\ \nonumber
    U_2(p,n) &=& \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 - (-1)^p + (-1)^n + (-1)^{p+n}\right), \\ \nonumber
    U_3(p,n) &=& \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 + (-1)^p + (-1)^n - (-1)^{p+n}\right), \\
    U_4(p,n) &=& \frac{1}{2}\left( 1 + (-1)^p - (-1)^n + (-1)^{p+n}\right).
\end{eqnarray}
Using the definition $U_i = U_i(p, n)$ for states with momentum $p$
and winding $n$ the desired one loop partition function is given by
the modular invariant trace
\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
  && {\rm Tr} \left( e^{i\tau \mathcal{H}}
      \left[    \vphantom{(-1)^{\tilde F_{\sigma}}}
          U_3
            - (-1)^{F_{\tau}}U_4
            - (-1)^{F_{\sigma}}U_2
            - (-1)^{F_{\sigma}+F_{\tau}}U_1
        \right] \right. \\ \nonumber
    && \hphantom{{\rm Tr} \left( e^{i\tau \mathcal{H}}\right.} \left.   
        \left[
          U_3
            - (-1)^{\tilde F_{\tau}}U_4
            - (-1)^{\tilde F_{\sigma}}U_2
            \pm (-1)^{\tilde F_{\sigma} + \tilde F_{\tau}}U_1
        \right]
    \right),
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_{\sigma, \tau}$ are the left-moving fermion number operators acting in
the $\sigma, \tau$ directions and $\mathcal{H}= L_0 + \bar{L_0}$ is the
Hamiltonian. The signs between the terms have been chosen to
correspond to the Type IIA,B string.

The vertex operators we are interested in survive the zero temperature
GSO projection.  The analysis in the previous  section confirms that all
momentum modes of them survive, enabling us to discuss the two point
function as an analytic function of frequency.

\subsection{Mass-Shell Conditions}

Each one of our vertex operator carries quantum numbers corresponding
to its dependence on various coordinates.  One of the general
properties of holography is the relation between on-shell bulk
quantities and off-shell boundary correlators. For this to be
possible, it is essential that the observables have a sufficient range
of bulk quantum numbers which are invisible from the boundary
perspective. One should be able to solve the bulk mass-shell
conditions for each value of the boundary quantum numbers.  In our
case the latter include the spatial momenta $q_i$, and the Matsubara
frequencies $p$. Even in the zero temperature analysis of
\cite{gk} this proves to be impossible, and we will see similar issues
arise here.

The graviton vertex operator in the full target space is given by
\begin{equation}
    g_{ij}(q_i, p) = e^{-\phi-\bar\phi} \psi_{(i} \bar{\psi_{j)}}
    e^{iq_iX^i} \Phi_{J p },
\end{equation}
where $\phi$, $\bar\phi$ are the bosonized superghost fields and $X^i$,
$\psi_i$, $\bar{\psi_i}$ are the free bosons and fermions in the
$\mathbb{R}^5$ component of the full CFT. The indices $i$, $j$ in this
expression are symmetrized. The vertex operator $\Phi_{Jp}$ is the
$\ensuremath{S\!L(2,\mathbb{R})}/U(1)$ vertex operator discussed above, with the winding set to zero.
 
In writing $g_{ij}(q_i, p)$ as a function of $q_i$, $p$ only we imply
that other quantum numbers are to be regarded as implicit function of
those, given by the mass-shell condition. The mass-shell condition
arises as the requirement that $g_{ij}$ be a conformally invariant
vertex operator. Specifically,
\begin{equation}
\label{mass}
     \frac{q^2}{2} - \frac{ J(J-1)}{k} + \frac{p^2}{4k} = 0,
\end{equation}
so that $J$ is a function of the off-shell quantum numbers $q_i$,
$p$. In particular, the bound on $J$ translates here to a bound on
those quantum numbers, exactly as in \cite{gk}.

\section{Correlation Functions}

We are now ready to exhibit the thermal two-point functions of the
operators we are interested in. The ingredients of this calculation
were performed in \cite{teschner}, and reviewed in \cite{gk, MO3}.

In the notation of \cite{MO3} the two-point correlator of functions
(tachyon vertex operators) on $S\!L(2,\mathbb{C})/U(1)$, the Euclidean
version of
\ensuremath{S\!L(2,\mathbb{R})}, can be calculated in the $x$-space (defined below) as
\begin{equation}
    \left<\Phi_J(x_1)\Phi_J'(x_2)\right> = \frac{\delta(J-J')B(J)}
    {|z_{12}|^{2h}|\bar z_{12}|^{2\bar h}|x_{12}|^{4J}},
\end{equation}
where $h,\bar{h}$ are the conformal weights, and $x_{12} = x_1-x_2$.
The $x$ basis is related to the $M$ basis, used in the present paper,
via
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{JM\bar M}=\int\frac{d^2x}{|x|^2}x^{J-M}x^{J-\bar
    M}\Phi_J(x).
\end{equation}
This gives \cite{MO3}
\begin{equation}
\label{tes}
    \left<\Phi_{JM\bar M}\Phi_{J'M'\bar M'}\right> =
    \frac{\pi\delta^2(M+M')\delta(J-J)B(J)} {|z_{12}|^{2h}|\bar
    z_{12}|^{2\bar h}\gamma(2J)} \frac{\Gamma(J+M)\Gamma(J-\bar M)}
    {\Gamma(1-J+M)\Gamma(1-J-\bar M)}.
\end{equation}

The functions $B(J)$ and $\gamma(2J)$ are defined in
\cite{teschner,gk}:
\begin{equation}
    B(J) = \frac{k\nu^{1-2J}}{\pi\gamma(\frac{2J-1}{k})},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(x) = \frac{\Gamma(x)}{\Gamma(1-x)}.
\end{equation}
The constant $\nu$ and the function $B(J)$ both equal $1$ in the large
$k$ limit we are taking.

In calculating the spacetime two point function, one has to divide by
the volume of the conformal group. This normally makes the two point
function vanish, but in this context it is compensated by the volume
of target space \cite{seib, kutasov, MO3}. This leaves a finite piece,
which was calculated in \cite{MO3}.

In making the correlation function of our vertex operators $g_{ij}$,
the additional ingredients will make little difference. They will
modify the conformal weights in the denominator of (\ref{tes}), and
will multiply the correlator by a polarization dependent tensor in the
flat spatial directions.

The two point function of the vertex operators $g_{ij}(q_i, p)$ is
then given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left<g_{ij}(q_i, p)g_{kl}(q'_i, p')\right> \propto \,
 (\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} + \delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}) \delta^5(q+q')\,
 \delta(p+p') \, \times \nonumber \\ \times \,
 \frac{1}{2J-1}\,\frac{1}{\gamma(2J)}\,\frac{\Gamma(J+M)\Gamma(J-\bar
 M)} {\Gamma(1-J+M)\Gamma(1-J-\bar M)}
\end{eqnarray}

Here $M, \bar{M}$ and $J$ are regarded as functions of the quantum
numbers $q_i$, $p$. We now proceed to comment on the structure of this
result and its analytic continuation to real frequencies.

\subsection{Euclidean Space}

The temperature Green's function can be written as a function of the
Matsubara frequencies $p$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{corr}
  \mathcal{G} \sim \frac{1}{\gamma(1 + \sqrt{1+2kq^2+p^2})} \,
  \frac{\Gamma^2(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+2kq^2+p^2}+\frac{p}{2})} {\Gamma^2(\frac{1}{2}
  - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+2kq^2+p^2}+\frac{p}{2})}.
\end{equation}
This is found using the conditions $M=p/2$, $\bar M=-p/2$, and the
solution
\begin{equation}
    J = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+2kq^2+p^2}
\end{equation}
to the mass-shell condition (\ref{mass}).

A second solution to the mass-shell condition is discarded as it
violates the lower bound on $J$. The upper bound imposes a constraint
on a combination of the Euclidean energy $p$ and the transverse
momentum $q$,
\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{1+2kq^2+p^2}<k-2.
\end{equation}

There is an additional condition $M=J-n=p/2$, for $n$ an integer of
definite sign, since those are the allowed values in the discrete
representations. Positive $n$ corresponds to a highest-weight
representation, while negative $n$ corresponds to a lowest-weight
representation. This translates, using the mass-shell condition, to
\begin{equation}
  \frac{kq^2}{2}+n^2 = J(2n-1).
\end{equation}
Since $J$ is positive it is clear that $n$ must be positive as well,
so only the highest-weight representations are allowed.

So we see that only a discrete set of points in the frequency-momentum
space is obtained by the Euclidean string theory calculation. Our
approach is to analytically continue the result as needed, and attempt
interpretation of the correlator as a function of Lorentzian
frequencies\footnote{We note that the original derivation of the
correlators \cite{teschner} utilizes analytic continuation as well. It
would be interesting to explore alternative Lorentzian continuations,
along the lines of \cite{steve}.}.

\subsection{Minkowski Space}

The temperature Green's function $\mathcal{G}(p)$ can be analytically continued
to the retarded Green's function $G_R(\omega)$ using $p\to
-i\omega+\delta$. The analytic continuation of $\mathcal{G}$ is not unique
since it can, for example, be multiplied by a phase which vanishes at the
poles. Typically one requires a fall-off condition for large Euclidean
frequencies in order to fix the analytic continuation uniquely.

These fall-off conditions require knowledge of the correlators at
arbitrarily high Euclidean frequencies. As our frequencies are a
priori bounded (for any finite $k$), we are unable to discuss those
fall-off conditions. Even without modifying the correlator found by
Teschner (which is exact in tree level string theory), it is possible
that small modifications to the mass shell condition (\ref{mass}) will
result in satisfying the asymptotic fall-off conditions. We assume
this to be the case; as mentioned in the introduction a real time
calculation of the retarded Green's function will be useful to confirm
or refute this point.

We assume therefore that the form of the correlator (\ref{corr})
applies to Lorentzian frequencies as well.  The retarded Green's
function is therefore taken to be
\begin{equation}
  G_R \sim \frac{\Gamma(-\sqrt{1+2kq^2-\omega^2}) \Gamma^2(\frac{1}{2} +
  \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+2kq^2-\omega^2}+\frac{i\omega}{2})} {\Gamma(1 +
  \sqrt{1+2kq^2-\omega^2}) \Gamma^2(\frac{1}{2} -
  \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1+2kq^2-\omega^2}+\frac{i\omega}{2})}.
\end{equation}

In a retarded Green's function an instability will manifest itself as a
pole (or other type of singularity, for more complex instabilities)
below the real axis. This will be a process which grows, rather than
decays, as a function of time. As we are looking for modes which may
destabilize the system upon including arbitrarily small corrections,
the interesting structure for our purposes occurs on the real
axis. This structure represents modes that are stable in the thermal
ensemble, an unusual feature.

The retarded Green's function found above has only one set of
singularities, coming from the factor
$\Gamma(-\sqrt{1+2kq^2-\omega^2})$. The singularities are located at
\begin{equation}
  \omega = \pm\sqrt{1+2kq^2-n^2},
\end{equation}
where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. These points are located along the
real and imaginary axes.  The points along the real axis are bounded
(for generic\footnote{There are some more possibilities at
special kinematic points, but as those will be sensitive to small
corrections, we concentrate on generic kinematics.} spatial momenta
$q_i$),
\begin{equation}
    |\omega| < \sqrt{1+2kq^2}.
\end{equation}

We see that a large number of possible instabilities is present for
non-zero spatial momenta $q^2$, a number of order ${k q^2}$. We note
that the holographic dual to LST contains a continuum of modes above a
gap, whose role in the theory is unclear. A typical momentum of those
modes, just above the gap, is $q^2 \sim \frac{1}{k}$. Therefore there
are order $k$ possible ``nearly destabilizing'' modes, and nearly
all of them are above the gap. The frequencies of those modes are much
smaller than $k$ (where our analysis is expected to receive corrections).

On the other hand, for zero spatial momentum there is only one such
possible mode, at $|\omega| = 1$\footnote{An additional potential
pole at $\omega=0$ is eliminated by a zero at that frequency.}. We see
a similar picture to the one suggested in \cite{kutasov}, where the
instability depends on the spatial volume (or the spatial momentum in
our case).

The retarded Green's function also has a set of zeros. These are on
the imaginary axis, so in particular they can eliminate a possible
divergence only for special values of $q_i$, the spatial momentum.
