Decoherence associated with super-Hubble modes in de Sitter space may
have a dual description, in which it is attributed to interaction 
of sub-Hubble modes with an ``environment'' residing just inside the
observer's horizon. We present a version of such description, together 
with some consistency checks, which it is shown to pass. \\
