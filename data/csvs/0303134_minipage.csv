Using the nonlinear realizations of the Virasoro group we
construct the action of the Conformal Quantum Mechanics (CQM) with
additional harmonic potential. We show that $SL(2,R)$ invariance
group of this action is nontrivially embedded in the
reparametrization group of the time which is isomorphic to the
centerless Virasoro group. We generalize the consideration to the
Ermakov systems and construct the action for the time dependent
oscillator. Its symmetry group is also the $SL(2,R) \sim SU(1,1)$
group embedded in the Virasoro group in a more complicated way.
