We derive a local, gauge invariant action for the $SU(N)$ non-linear
$\sigma$-model in $2+1$ dimensions. In this setting, the model is
defined in terms of a self-interacting pseudo-vector field
$\theta_\mu$, with values in the Lie algebra of the group $SU(N)$.
Thanks to a non-trivially realized gauge invariance, the model has the
correct number of physical degrees of freedom: only one polarization
of $\theta_\mu$, like in the case of the familiar Yang-Mills theory in
$2+1$ dimensions.  Moreover, since $\theta_\mu$ is a pseudo-vector,
the physical content corresponds to one massless {\em pseudo-scalar\/}
field in the Lie algebra of $SU(N)$, as in the standard representation
of the model.  We show that the dynamics of the physical polarization
corresponds to that of the $SU(N)$ non-linear $\sigma$-model in the
standard representation, and also construct the corresponding BRST
invariant gauge-fixed action.
