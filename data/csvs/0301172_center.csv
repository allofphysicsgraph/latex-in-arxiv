\caption{Parameter surface leading to anti-de Sitter spacetime in the
$(\alpha,\varepsilon,\beta)$ space. The green region refers to
parameters leading to $v_\zero < 1/4$ where the second derivative of
the Higgs field is well defined at $\radim=0$, while the red region
corresponds to $ 1/4< v_\zero < 1$, where only the first derivative is
finite in the string core. The thick curve gives the points leading to
$v_\zero=1$ along which all the derivatives of the Higgs field are
well defined. We have also represented in purple the parameter area
giving $v_\zero=1 \pm 0.1$. The shaded region is associated with
$v_\zero > 1$ and is thus not physical.}

the regimes where $v_\zero < 1/4$, $ 1/4< v_\zero < 1$ and $v_\zero

the left picture, the warp factors are plotted in the middle one,
while the right plot represents the field $\radim l/2$ involved in the
constraint equation (\ref{eq:l0num}), with the warp function
$v(\radim)$ and $f(\radim)/\radim$.} \label{fig:solgrav}
