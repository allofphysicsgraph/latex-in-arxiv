We study the direct interaction of an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond
field with a scalar particle derived from a gauge principle. The
method outlined in this paper to define a covariant derivative is
applied to a simple model leading to a linear coupling between the
fields. Although no conserved Noether charge exists, a conserved
topological current comes out from the antisymmetry properties of
the Kalb-Ramond field. Some interesting features of this current
are pointed out.
