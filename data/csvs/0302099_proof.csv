%{\it Proof.}
Proceed by induction on $n = \dim T-\dim W$.  If $n=0$, then $T\subseteq
S$ and we can take $Y=X$.  If $n>0$, then $\dim W < \dim T$, and since we
assumed that
\[ T_{W,w} = T_{T,w}\cap T_{S,w}, \]
we conclude that $T_{T,w}$ is not contained in $T_{S,w}$.

Observe that $T_{S,w}$ is the intersection of the (Zariski) tangent
spaces $T_{X',w}$ of all the local hypersurfaces $X'$ through $w$ that
contain $S$. Since $T_{T,w}$ is not
contained in $T_{S,w}$, there exists a hypersurface $X'$ that contains
$S$ and such that $T_{T,w}\not\subseteq T_{X',w}$.  Thus $X'$ and $T'
= T\cap X$ are smooth at $w$, of dimensions $\dim X - 1$ and $\dim T
-1$, respectively, and $S\subseteq X'$.  We have
\[ S\cap T' = S\cap (X'\cap T) = (S\cap X')\cap T = S\cap T = W, \]
thus we are in the same situation as before, but with
$\dim T'-\dim W = n-1$.  By the induction hypothesis we can find $Y$
in $X'$ satisfying the conditions of the proposition.  Considering $Y$
inside of $X$ instead of $X'$ still satisfies (a) and (b), and we have
\begin{align*}
\dim Y+\dim T-\dim X & = \dim Y+(\dim T' + 1) - (\dim X'+1) \\
& = \dim Y+\dim T'-\dim X' = \dim W. 
\end{align*}

1,"\begin{proof}
Since the question is local and $T$ is locally a complete
intersection, we can use the Koszul resolution with respect to the
normal bundle to obtain a locally free resolution of ${\cal O}_T$
\[ \cdots\rightarrow \Lambda^{q+1} {\cal G}^{\vee} \rightarrow \Lambda^q {\cal G}^{\vee} 
\rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow {\cal G}^{\vee} \rightarrow {\cal O}_X \rightarrow {\cal O}_T \rightarrow 0 \] 
around every point of $T$, where ${\cal G}$ is locally free on $X$
and ${\cal G}|_T\simeq {\cal N}_{T/X}$.  
To compute $\mbox{Tor}_q^X({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T)$ we
tensor this resolution by ${\cal O}_S$, which has the effect of restricting
all the bundles to $S$ and making all the maps in the complex zero,
hence the result.
\"
2,"\begin{proof}
By Proposition~\ref{app:prop1}, around every point of $W$ we can find
$Y$ smooth such that $S$ is contained in $Y$, $T$ and $Y$ intersect
in the expected dimension, and $W=T\cap Y$.  

Since $T$ and $Y$ intersect in the expected dimension, using
Proposition~\ref{app:prop3} we see that the change-of-rings spectral
sequence~\cite[Exercise A3.45]{Eis}
\[ \mbox{Tor}_q^Y({\cal O}_S, \mbox{Tor}_p^X({\cal O}_T, {\cal O}_Y)) \Longrightarrow
\mbox{Tor}_{p+q}^X({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T) \]
consists of the single column
\[ \mbox{Tor}_q^Y({\cal O}_S, \mbox{Tor}_0^X({\cal O}_T, {\cal O}_Y)) = \mbox{Tor}_q^Y({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_W) =
\Lambda^q {\cal N}_{S/Y}^{\vee}|_W, \]
where the last equality is Proposition~\ref{app:prop2}.  In other
words,
\[ \mbox{Tor}_q^X({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T) = \Lambda^q {\cal N}_{S/Y}^{\vee}|_W. \]

At each $w\in W$, the composition of maps
\[ {\cal N}_{S/Y,w} = T_{Y,w}/T_{S,w} \rightarrow T_{X,w}/T_{S,w} \rightarrow 
T_{X,w}/(T_{S,w}+T_{T,w}) = \tilde{N}_w \]
is injective, because a tangent vector to $Y$ will be tangent to $T$
only if it is tangent to $W$, and then it is tangent to $S$.  Comparing
dimensions, we see that the natural map ${\cal N}_{S/Y}\to
\tilde{N}$ is therefore an isomorphism.
Finally,
one can trace through the identifications and see that the local
isomorphism
\[ \mbox{Tor}_q^X({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T) \cong \Lambda^q \tilde{N}^{\vee} \]
does not depend on the choice of $Y$, hence it lifts to a global
isomorphism. 

As this calculation can be tedious, we supplement this argument with
an alternative approach.  The claimed result is elementary to check
directly for $q=0$.  For $q=1$ this is also straightforward: using the
exact sequence
\[
0\to \mathcal{I}_S\to \mathcal{O}_X\to \mathcal{O}_S\to 0,
\]
we compute that $\mbox{Tor}_1^X({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T)$ is isomorphic
to the kernel of the map
\[
\mathcal{I}_S\otimes\mathcal{O}_T\to \mathcal{O}_T,
\]
namely 
\[
\frac{\mathcal{I}_S\cap\mathcal{I}_T}{\mathcal{I}_S\mathcal{I}_T}.
\]
But this can be seen directly to be isomorphic to $\tilde{N}^{\vee}$; the
isomorphism is induced by the natural map
$(\mathcal{I}_S\cap\mathcal{I}_T)/(\mathcal{I}_S\mathcal{I}_T)\to 
\tilde{N}^{\vee}$ taking a class represented by a function
$f$ to the linear functional on $\tilde{N}$ induced
by $df$.

For $q>1$ we note the existence of a natural map
\begin{equation}
\label{higherq}
\Lambda^q\mbox{Tor}_1^X({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T)\to
\mbox{Tor}_q^X({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T).
\end{equation}
This alternating product is constructed by using the exterior algebra
structure on any local Koszul resolution and the multiplication on 
$\mathcal{O}_T$.  As the algebra structure on the Koszul complex is 
canonical (a change of regular sequence induces a canonical isomorphism
of algebras), the map (\ref{higherq}) is canonical, independent of the
choice of local defining equations yielding the Koszul complex.  Then
our earlier local calculations show that (\ref{higherq}) is an isomorphism.

3,"\begin{proof}
By the projection formula~(\cite[2.3.5]{andreithesis},~\cite[II.5.6]{HarRD}) we have
\[ j_* \mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E} = i_*{\cal E} \stackrel{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_X j_* {\cal O}_T. \]
On the other hand, since $j_*$ is exact, we have
\[ {\cal H}_q (j_* \mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E}) = j_* {\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E}), \]
and thus
\[ {\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E}) = j^* {\cal H}_q (j_* \mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E}) = j^*
{\cal H}_q(i_*{\cal E} \stackrel{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_X j_* {\cal O}_T). \] 
(Here we have used the fact that for a sheaf or twisted sheaf, pulling
back {\em in the underived way} its push-forward by a closed embedding
yields back the original sheaf.)  Using the projection formula again
for $i_*$ we have
\[ i_* {\cal E} \stackrel{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_X j_* {\cal O}_T = i_* ({\cal E} \otimes_S \mathbf{L} i^* j_*
{\cal O}_T), \]
and since ${\cal E}$ is locally free on $S$ we get
\[ {\cal H}_q(i_* {\cal E} \stackrel{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_X j_* {\cal O}_T) = i_* {\cal H}_q({\cal E} \otimes_S \mathbf{L} i^* j_*
{\cal O}_T) = i_* ({\cal E} \otimes_S {\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} i^* j_* {\cal O}_T)). \]
But for {\em sheaves} and {\em underived operations}, $j^* i_* = l_*
k^*$.  Therefore
\begin{eqnarray*}
{\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E}) & = & j^* i_* ({\cal E} \otimes_S {\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} i^* j_*
{\cal O}_T))  \\
 & = & l_* k^* ({\cal E} \otimes_S {\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} i^* j_* {\cal O}_T)) \\
 & = & l_*
({\cal E}|_W \otimes {\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} i^* j_* {\cal O}_T)|_W), 
\end{eqnarray*}
which is the first result.  Applying again the projection formula we have
\[ {\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} i^* j_* {\cal O}_T) = i^* {\cal H}_q(i_* {\cal O}_S \stackrel{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes}_X j_*
{\cal O}_T) = i^*\mbox{Tor}_q^X( {\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T). \]
By Proposition~\ref{app:prop4}, 
\[ \mbox{Tor}_q^X({\cal O}_S, {\cal O}_T) = \Lambda^q \tilde{N}^{\vee}, \]
hence the second result.
\"
4,"\begin{proof}
To prove the first statement it is enough to show that there exist
natural local isomorphisms 
\[ \mathbf{R}\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_U(l_* {\cal G} |_U,  {\cal F} |_U) = l_* \mathbf{R}\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_V( {\cal G} |_V, l^!( {\cal F} |_V)) \]
for $U$ an open set of $T$, sufficiently small to trivialize $\alpha$,
and $V=U\cap W$.  (Here we work with either the analytic or the
\'etale topology, as the Zariski topology is not fine enough for the
Brauer group to be interesting.)  In this form, the above isomorphism
is nothing else than duality for a finite morphism~(\cite[III.7.3,
III.6.7 and Definition after III.1.3]{HarRD}; see~\cite{BanSta} for
similar statements for morphisms of analytic spaces).

The second statement follows immediately from the fact that 
\[ \mathbf{R}\Gamma(T, \mathbf{R}\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_T(\,\cdot\,, \,\cdot\,)) = \mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _T(\,\cdot\,, \,\cdot\,)
\]
for $\alpha$-twisted sheaves~\cite[2.3.2]{andreithesis}.
\"
5,"\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{app:mainthm}]
{\it Proof of the main theorem.}
The functor $\mathbf{L} j^*$ is left adjoint to
$j_*$~(\cite[2.3.9]{andreithesis},~\cite[II.5.11]{HarRD}), so we have
\[  \mbox{Ext} ^{p+q}_X(i_*{\cal E}, j_*  {\cal F} ) = {\cal H}^{p+q}\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _X(i_*{\cal E}, j_* {\cal F} ) =
{\cal H}^{p+q}\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _T(\mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E}, {\cal F}). \] 
Writing down the Grothendieck spectral sequence for the composition of
the two functors $\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _T(\,\cdot\,, {\cal F})$ (contravariant) and $\mathbf{L} j^*
i_*(\,\cdot\,)$ (covariant) yields the convergent spectral sequence
\[ {}^2E^{pq} = {\cal H}^p\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _T({\cal H}_q(\mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E}), {\cal F}) \Longrightarrow
{\cal H}^{p+q}\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _T(\mathbf{L} j^* i_* {\cal E}, {\cal F}). \]
(Note the implicit change of sign in $q$, due to the fact that
$\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _T(\,\cdot\,,  {\cal F} )$ is contravariant.)  Using
Proposition~\ref{app:prop5} we get that 
\[ {}^2E^{pq} = {\cal H}^p\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _T(l_*({\cal E}|_W \otimes \Lambda^q \tilde{N}^{\vee}), {\cal F}),
\]
which by Grothendieck duality (Proposition~\ref{app:prop6}) gives
\[ {}^2E^{pq} = {\cal H}^p\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _W({\cal E}|_W \otimes \Lambda^q \tilde{N}^{\vee}, {\cal F}|_W
\otimes \Lambda^{m} {\cal N}_{W/T}[-m]). \]
But ${\cal E}$ and $\Lambda^q \tilde{N}^{\vee}$ are locally free, so 
\begin{align*}
{}^2E^{pq} & = {\cal H}^p\mathbf{R} \mbox{Hom} _W({\cal E}|_W \otimes \Lambda^q \tilde{N}^{\vee}, {\cal F}|_W
\otimes \Lambda^{m} {\cal N}_{W/T}[-m]) \\
& = H^{p-m}(W, {\cal E}^{\vee}|_W \otimes {\cal F}|_W \otimes \Lambda^{top} 
{\cal N}_{W/T} \otimes \Lambda^q \tilde{N}). 
\end{align*}
Renumbering and putting it all together we arrive at our result: there
exists a convergent spectral sequence
\[ {}^2E^{pq} = H^p(W, {\cal E}^{\vee}|_W \otimes {\cal F}|_W \otimes
\Lambda^{m} {\cal N}_{W/T} \otimes \Lambda^{q-m} \tilde{N}) \Longrightarrow
 \mbox{Ext} ^{p+q}_X(i_*{\cal E}, j_* {\cal F}). \]
