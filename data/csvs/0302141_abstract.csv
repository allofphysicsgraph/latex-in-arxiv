Towards describing color confinement, we derive an effective Abelian 
gauge theory (EAGT) of a modified $SU(2)$ gluodynamics.  
The modification is made by explicitly introducing 
mass terms of the off-diagonal gluon fields into pure $SU(2)$ gluodynamics, 
or $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory,  
in order that Abelian dominance at a long-distance scale is realized 
in $SU(2)$ QCD. 
In deriving the EAGT, the off-diagonal gluon fields involving 
longitudinal modes are treated as 
fields that produce quantum effects on the diagonal gluon field and 
other fields relevant at a long-distance scale.  
Unlike earlier papers, a necessary gauge fixing is carried out 
without spoiling the global $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. 
We show that the EAGT allows a composite of the Yukawa and 
the linear potentials which also occurs in an extended dual Abelian 
Higgs model. This composite potential is understood to be 
a static potential between color-electric charges, whose  
origin may be assigned to the gluon fields. 
In addition, we point out that the EAGT involves the Skyrme-Faddeev 
model.
