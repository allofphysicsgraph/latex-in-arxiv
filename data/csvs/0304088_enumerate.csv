\item The results presented here particularly the one-loop eight mass-dimensional effective Lagrangian await further simplification. While the antisymmetry of the fieldstrength tensor and the freedom to throw away total derivatives allowed us to obtain the most we can do to obtain the present simplified form of ${\cal L}^{(1)[8]}$, the identities (\ref{id-frst})-(\ref{id-last})
will hopefully reduce the present form (\ref{L8}) into 17 linearly independent invariant monomials as they have been obtained by van de Ven\cite{ven} via the heat kernel approach.
%
%
\item The prescriptions described in Chapter 4 to obtain ${\cal L}^{(1)[10]}$ and ${\cal L}^{(1)[12]}$ await similar reduction process. If such reduced Lagrangians are to be consistent with Ref. \cite{Mue} monomial counting for a specific mass-dimensions, there should be 79 linearly independent invariant monomials for ${\cal L}^{(1)[10]}$ as it has been worked completely in Ref. \cite{ven} and 554 such invariant monomials for ${\cal L}^{(1)[12]}$ as it has been counted by Ref. \cite{Mue}. Both effective Lagrangians remain to be worked out explicitly in the spirit of background field formalism.
%
%
\item The following options are left arbitrary throughout our calculation. Fixing them can be considered an extension to our present work.
%
\subitem Gauge group. This would facilitate in the reduction process and express one-loop effective Lagrangians in terms of linearly independent invariant monomials. Particularly, the minimal set upon which the reduction scheme will be based would be chosen by group representation methods rather than by hand.
\subitem Mass-Dimensions (higher than 12). This means accommodating higher order corrections. Mathematically, this is equivalent to handling higher powers of momentum and higher folds of proper-time integrations.
\subitem Further relaxation on the covariant restrictions in the fieldstrength tensor ($n>4$) and in the background matrix potential ($l>4$)
%
%
\item The following options can be changed.
%
\subitem Euclidean spacetime metric to a conformally flat metric, or in general curved spacetime metric that may be relevant in quantum gravity and early universe theories.

Also, the assumption of strong and slowly varying background fields as indicated after Eqn. \ref{G} can be changed to weak but rapidly changing one. Calculating mass-dimensional one-loop effective Lagrangians in this line of assumption remains an open problem.
%
\item The most interesting extension of this thesis is the application of the results to a specific field theory.
This is done simply by determining the relevant background connection $N_\mu$ so that the following quantities can be defined:
\begin{eqnarray*}
X&\equiv& M-N_\mu N_\mu     \\
    Y_{\mu\nu}&\equiv&
     N_{\nu,\mu}- N_{\mu,\nu}
    +[N_\mu,N_\nu]
\end{eqnarray*}
as these are given in (\ref{X}), and (\ref{Y})
and the covariant derivative
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\cal D}_\mu T &\equiv & \partial_\mu T + \left[N_\mu,T\right]
\\
 {\cal D}_\mu \phi &\equiv & \partial_\mu \phi + N_\mu \phi
\end{eqnarray}
for any tensor $T$, and scalar $\phi$.
One may alternatively determine these quantities if the relevant second order operator
\begin{eqnarray}
 \Delta \equiv (\partial + N_\mu)^2 + X
\end{eqnarray}
is identified. This is the operator part of (\ref{Grnf}). Here, $X = -m^2 +{\cal X}$.

Showing only the relevant second order operator\cite{Rodf-Diss,Tiam} for the following field theories:
\subitem \textbf{Pure Yang-Mills theory}
\begin{eqnarray}
 (\Delta^{\mathrm{vector}})^{ab}_{\alpha\beta}
   &=&
  \left(\partial_\mu\delta^{ab}\delta_{\alpha\beta}
        - g f^{abc} A^c_\mu \delta_{\alpha\beta} - 2g f^{abc} F^c_{\alpha\beta}
  \right)
\\
 (\Delta^{\mathrm{ghost}})^{ab}
  &=&
 \left(\partial_\mu \delta^{ab} - g f^{abc} A^c_\mu \right)
\end{eqnarray}
These are the vector and ghost operators, where
\begin{eqnarray}
 F^a_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^c_\nu
\end{eqnarray}
\subitem \textbf{Scalar bosons in a Yang-Mills background}
\begin{eqnarray}
 \Delta^{\mathrm{boson}}
 \equiv
 (\partial_\mu - ig T^a_s A^a_\mu)^2 +m^2_s
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
 \mathrm{Tr}\left(T^a_sT^b_s\right) = T_s \delta^{ab}
\end{eqnarray}
to normalize the generators of the fundamental representation.
\subitem \textbf{Dirac fermions in a Yang-Mills background}
\begin{eqnarray}
 \Delta^{\mathrm{fermion}}
 \equiv
 \gamma_\mu(\partial_\mu - ig T^a_f A^a_\mu)^2 + i m_f \mathbf{1}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left\{\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu\right\} &=& 2 \delta_{\mu\nu} \mathbf{1}
\\
 \sigma_{\mu\nu} &=& \frac{i}{2}\left[\gamma_\mu,\gamma_\nu,\right]
\\
\mathrm{Tr}\mathbf{1} &=& 2^{D/2}
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
 \mathrm{Tr}\left(T^a_fT^b_f\right) = T_f \delta^{ab}
\end{eqnarray}
to normalize the generators of the fundamental representation.
Here, $\gamma_\mu$ represents a $2^{[D/2]}\times 2^{[D/2]}$ Dirac matrix normalized as above.

See Refs. \cite{Rodf-Diss,Tiam} for details on the results of this thesis can be applied to Yang-Mills theory interacting with matter.

\item All calculations described since then are all up to one-loop. One may consider calculating higher loop effective Lagrangians.
\item All covariant derivatives are of integer type. One may consider calculating with fractional derivatives.
