\section{Introduction}
%
One of the most important developments in string theory of late
has been the realization that it contains many kinds of extended
objects like D$p$-branes. In many situations these objects can be
treated much like elementary particles, in that they carry a
generalised mass and charge and these give rise to mutual forces
which govern their relative motion.

This observation is all the more interesting when the dimension of
the brane exceeds three, since then the moving branes can contain
an entire world inside of themselves (possibly including us). In
this kind of picture the collision of D$p$-branes can be
interpreted as colliding universes. This observation has recently
been used to propose several novel scenarios for the very-early
universe, giving rise to inflation
or alternatives to inflation
\cite{BI,OurBI,dvali,GRZ,BIO,majumdar,Ekpyrosis,cyclic,rev},
 allowing in both
cases an attractive geometrical and stringy interpretation of the
various cosmologically-active scalar fields.

Perhaps the best-studied brane interactions are brane collisions,
which in the particular case of branes and antibranes can lead to
brane annihilation (for which  insights have come from
recent studies of tachyon condensation). However these kinds of
direct collisions only begin to explore the rich kinds of physics
which are possible when particles and branes mutually interact. A
different --- and for D$p$-branes as yet largely unexplored ---
possibility is the development of bound orbits, such as commonly
arise for particles interacting through central forces.

In this paper we begin the study of the properties of the brane
generalisation of such bound orbits. We do so partly motivated by
the potential applications of such a study to brane-world
cosmology. In particular we could imagine the brane which makes up
our own universe being in a closed orbit around another brane due
to the mutually attractive forces which act between them. But
regardless of these applications, we regard brane bound states to
be of interest in their own right inasmuch as they add to our
understanding of how branes and strings can interact.

We start this study here with a discussion of the bound states
which are possible for brane/antibrane systems. These are among
the simplest to use in applications, partly because of the
triviality of the various consistency conditions which would
otherwise arise when trying to construct brane configurations
inside compact extra dimensions. We call this kind of bound state
`branonium' due to its obvious similarity with the analogous
electron/positron system: positronium.

Our discussion is couched in terms of a test antibrane which is
moving within the fields sourced by a system of $N$ parallel
branes. We set up the effective brane lagrangian for this motion
and analyse the features of the resulting bound orbits. It happens
that despite the many complications of the resulting effective
Lagrangian, it is still possible to solve explicitly for the
trajectory of the extended test brane, with a result which is very
similar to those obtained for nonrelativistic motion in a central
force. In particular we find the conditions for the existence of
stable closed orbits, and show that these include nontrivial
systems of D-branes, with perfectly elliptical (non-precessing)
orbits being possible if the branes move in three transverse
dimensions.

Finally, we give a preliminary study of the stability of the
system due to different sources, including radiation reaction due
to radiation of bulk and brane modes, as well as nonperturbative
instabilities and tachyonic modes.
The dominant instability appears to be towards radiation into
massless modes, and we compute the orbital decay time for this
process.

\section{Probe-Brane Analysis}
%
We start by setting up and solving the equations which are
relevant to the motion of a probe antibrane moving within the
background of $N$ parallel branes. To do so we first examine the
fields which the $N$ source branes set up, and then examine the
equations of motion which they imply for a test brane or
antibrane. We show how these equations may be solved for the
motion of the test-brane centre of mass when all other brane modes
are frozen. (We return to the question of {\it why} these modes
should be frozen in the next section.) Finally we examine the
bound-state orbits and identify the surprising special class for
which the exact {\it relativistic} orbits are ordinary conic
sections, and we study the properties of the orbits in this
special case in some detail.

\subsection{The Fields Due to $N$ Source Branes}
%
Let us first consider the gravitational, dilaton and
`electromagnetic' fields which are set up by a set of $N$ parallel
$p$-branes in $D$-dimensional spacetime. We take the action for
these fields to be given in the Einstein Frame by
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:EFbulkaction}
    S_s = - \int d^Dx \, \sqrt{- g} \left[ \frac12 \, g^{MN} \Bigl(
    R_{MN} + \partial_M \, \phi \, \partial_N \, \phi \Bigr) + {1
    \over 2 \, n!} \;e^{\alpha \phi} \, F_{M_1...M_n} \, F^{M_1...M_n}
    \right]\,,
\end{equation}
%
where the $n$-form field strength is related to its $(n-1)$-form
gauge potential in the usual way $F_{[n]} = dA_{[n-1]}$. Here $n$
is related to the spacetime dimension $d$ of the $N$ $p$-branes by
$d = p + 1 = n - 1$. We denote the $d$ coordinates parallel to the
branes by $x^\mu$ and the $D-d$ transverse coordinates by $y^m$.

The constant $\alpha$ depends on which kind of brane is being
considered. For instance, if $A_{[n-1]}$ were to arise from a
string-frame action
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:saction}
    S_{\rm SF} = - \, {1 \over 2 \, n!} \int d^Dx \,
    \sqrt{- \hat{g}} \;e^{\alpha_s \phi}
    \, F_{\hat{M}_1...\hat{M}_n} \, F^{\hat{M}_1...\hat{M}_n} \, ,
\end{equation}
%
with the string-frame metric given by $\hat{g}_{MN} = e^{\lambda
\phi} \, g_{MN}$ for $\lambda = 4/(D-2)$, then $\alpha = \alpha_s
+ 2 - \lambda(n-1)$. Two cases of particular interest are: ($i$)
NS-NS fields (like the fields rising in the gravity supermultiplet
in various dimensions), for which $\alpha_s = -2$ and so $\alpha =
\alpha_{NS} = -4(n-1)/(D-2)$; ($ii$) R-R fields, for which
$\alpha_s = 0$ and so $\alpha = \alpha_R = 2(D-2n)/(D-2)$. In the
special case $D=10$ we have $\lambda = "
