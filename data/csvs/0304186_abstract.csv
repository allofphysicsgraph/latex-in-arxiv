Alice electrodynamics (AED) is a theory of electrodynamics in which
charge conjugation is a local gauge symmetry. In this paper we
investigate a charge instability in alice electrodynamics in
(2+1)-dimensions due to this local charge conjugation. The instability
manifests itself through the creation of a pair of alice fluxes. The
final state is one in which the charge is completely delocalized,
i.e., it is carried as cheshire charge by the flux pair that gets
infinitely separated. We determine the decay rate in terms of the
parameters of the model. The relation of this phenomenon with other
salient features of 2-dimensional compact QED, such as linear
confinement due to instantons/monopoles, is discussed.
