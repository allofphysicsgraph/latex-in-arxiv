With a special choice of gauge the operator of the
Klein-Fock-Gordon equation in homogeneous electric field respects
boost symmetry. Using this symmetry we obtain solutions for the
scalar massive field equation in such a background (boost modes in
the electric field). We calculate the spectrum of particles
created by the electric field, as seen by an accelerated observer
at spatial infinity of the right wedge of Minkowski spacetime. It
is shown that the spectrum and the total number of created pairs
measured by a remote uniformly accelerated observer in Minkowski
spacetime are precisely the same as for inertial observers.
