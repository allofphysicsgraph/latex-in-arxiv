We give an elementary introduction to the structure of supergravity
theories. This leads to a table with an overview of supergravity and
supersymmetry theories in dimensions 4 to 11. The basic steps in
constructing supergravity theories are considered: determination of the

\section{Introduction}

Supergravity is now mostly known as an ingredient of superstring theory,
the theory that tells that the elementary particles are vibrations of a
fundamental string. This theory offers a magnificent framework to study
all particles and all interactions. Since 1994 there is an extended
framework connecting all the superstring theories and supergravities,
which is called M-theory. Many unexpected connections now emerge every
year from the study of superstrings and supergravities, increasing
continuously our capabilities to construct realistic models, to perform
calculations on gauge theories, to discuss models of cosmology and to
connect many different aspects of our knowledge of physics and
mathematics.

For many applications of string theory we just need to know the structure
of supergravity theories. The elementary particles that emerge from any
superstring theory and that are not hidden to us by being extremely
massive, nicely fit in supergravity theories. In this review, we will
consider supergravity in its own right, i.e.\ independent of its role in
superstring theory. We will consider the supergravities with fields that
occur in the action up to two derivatives. This corresponds only to the
first order in an $\alpha '$ perturbation theory of superstrings.

The part of the theory that describes the spinless fields is very
illustrative for the structure of such a supergravity theory. These
scalar fields determine the vacua of the theory. In the context of
superstring theory they are the moduli of deformations of the
compactifying dimensions. The scalar fields define a geometry, the
structure of which determines also a large part of the full action due to
the supersymmetry relations. We will at the end of this review consider
these geometries. It turns out that the richest geometric structures are
those that appear when there are 8 supersymmetries.

In the next section, we will review the basic ingredients of supergravity
theory at the bosonic side: the fields that are mostly $n$-forms with
gauge transformations, and dualities between their field strengths. The
mechanism of compensating fields will be shown and we will show how
Poincar{\'e} gravity is obtained as a gauge theory.

The fermionic side is introduced in section~\ref{ss:Clifford}. The
possibilities for supersymmetries are determined by a table of Clifford
algebras with specific properties. The classification of these lead to a
map of possible supergravities and supersymmetric theories that is
explained in section~\ref{ss:mapsusy}.

We can divide the discussion on supergravity theories in 4 steps. First,
in section~\ref{ss:salgebra}, we consider the algebra of the
transformations that leave the action invariant. We discuss the
super-Poincar{\'e} algebra, but also generalizations as central charges, the
(anti-)de Sitter algebra, the conformal algebra and their supersymmetric
extensions. Apart from the spacetime symmetries and the supersymmetries,
other bosonic gauge symmetries play a role. In particular there is the
R-symmetry, for which the supersymmetries form a non-trivial
representation. At the end of this section we show how these algebras are
used in constructing supergravity theories

The second step (section~\ref{ss:multiplets}) brings in the fields as
representations of the algebra. Such a set of fields is a
\emph{multiplet}, and there is a balance between bosonic and fermionic
fields with an \emph{on-shell counting}, but often also with an
\emph{off-shell counting}. We first explain this difference, and then
discuss the most important multiplet in various dimensions and with
various supersymmetry extensions.

In section~\ref{ss:actions} we look at the third step: the construction
of an action and its properties. We explain the duality transformations
in 4 dimensions, and how the kinetic terms of the scalars determine a
scalar geometry. We summarize how isometries generalize to hidden
symmetries of the action, often related to duality transformations, and
how a subgroup of them can be gauged.

The final step (section~\ref{ss:solutions}) involves the properties of
some solutions of the supergravity theories. The concept of BPS solutions
will appear, with charges that are at the boundary of an allowed domain.

As mentioned, the scalars of supergravity theories define a geometry, and
their kinetic terms in the action determine a metric. Often these are
symmetric spaces. An interesting subclass of supergravities, those with 8
supersymmetries, define \emph{special geometries}, which can be real,
K{\""a}hler or quaternionic manifolds. These geometric aspects are reviewed in
section~\ref{ss:scalGeom}, before concluding with some final remarks in
section~\ref{ss:final}.

\section{The ingredients: fields and gauge symmetry} \label{ss:bosIngred}

The bosonic fields that occur in supergravity theories are mostly
antisymmetric tensors (i.e. components of $n$-forms), with gauge
symmetries. There are exceptions, but for most theories one can restrict
to these types of bosonic fields. We will repeat the relevant general
formulae for gauge theories. These fields determine massless particles.
Masses for fields with spin 1 or higher appear by considering
spontaneously broken symmetries. The construction of Poincar{\'e} gravity as
a gauge theory needs already a special treatment.

Symmetries in field theories should be distinguished in different
categories. The simplest ones are \emph{rigid symmetries}. These are
transformations of the fields with a parameter, say $\Lambda $, that is
the same everywhere in spacetime. E.g.\ a rotation of the reference frame
is such a transformation. The second type are the \emph{local symmetries}
or \emph{gauge symmetries}, where this parameter can be taken differently
in any point of spacetime: $\Lambda (x)$, where $x$ denotes the spacetime
point. Furthermore, one should say what is left invariant under
`symmetries'. One can consider symmetries of the action, symmetries of
field equations (transforming a field equation in a linear combination of
field equations), or symmetries of solutions. A symmetry of the action
will also be a symmetry of the field equations but the reverse is not
necessarily true. Such symmetries are not necessarily symmetries of a
solution, and that is the concept of a \emph{spontaneously broken
symmetry}.

We now restrict ourselves to symmetries of the action. When we consider a
rigid symmetry, and try to promote it to a local symmetry, the action $S$
will in general not be invariant due to terms that show the
$x$-dependence of the parameter, i.e.\ $\delta S$ is proportional to
$\partial _\mu \Lambda (x)$,
\begin{equation}
  \delta (\Lambda ) S =\int \rmd^Dx\, J^\mu\,\partial _\mu \Lambda (x)\,,
 \label{delSJdLambda}
\end{equation}
for a $J^\mu $ (`Noether current'). $\mu=0,1,\ldots ,D-1$ labels
spacetime coordinates. To compensate these terms, one needs a field
$A_\mu (x)$ (gauge field) with
\begin{equation}
  S_{\rm new}= S - \int\rmd^Dx\, J^\mu\, A_\mu \,,\qquad
  \delta A_\mu(x) =\partial _\mu \Lambda (x)\,.
 \label{SwithA}
\end{equation}
This is the first step in an iterative procedure to construct invariant
actions (`Noether procedure'). The simplest example of a gauge field is
the Maxwell field that appears when promoting phase transformations of
complex fields that are proportional to their electric charges, to a
local symmetry. The gauge field induces a force between the particles
that transform under the symmetry.

Apart from the scalar fields, all bosonic fields that appear here are
gauge fields. The Maxwell field above can be seen as a 1-form $A=A_\mu
\rmd x^\mu $, and its transformation is $\delta A=\rmd \Lambda$. The
other bosonic fields will be $n$-forms $A^{(n)}$ with a symmetry
parameter that is an $n-1$ form: $\delta A^{(n)}=\rmd \Lambda^{(n-1)}$.
Not all the components of $\Lambda^{(n-1)}=\frac{1}{(n-1)!} \Lambda _{\mu
_1\ldots \mu _{n-1}}\rmd x^{\mu _1}\ldots \rmd x^{\mu _{n-1}}$ are
independent symmetries, as all transformations where
$\Lambda^{(n-1)}=\rmd \Lambda ^{\prime\,(n-2)}$ are not effective.
Counting the remaining gauge-invariant components of an $n$ form gives
\begin{equation}
  {D\choose n} - {D \choose n-1} + {D \choose n-2} - \ldots = {D-1\choose
  n}\,,
 \label{compnform}
\end{equation}
the number of components of an $n$-form in $D-1$ dimensions. This is a
general feature: the independent components form a representation of
$\mathop{\rm SO}(D-1)$. If furthermore the field equations of massless fields are
used, the independent components form representations of $\mathop{\rm SO}(D-2)$. The
former is called \emph{off-shell counting}, while the latter is called
\emph{on-shell counting}.  The number of off-shell components is also
equal to the number of components of a massive field. Indeed, the massive
physical fields are also characterized by $\mathop{\rm SO}(D-1)$ representations, as
that is the little group for a massive state, while $\mathop{\rm SO}(D-2)$ is the
little group of massless states.

The gauge invariant degrees of freedom for an $n$ form reside in an
$(n+1)$-form field strength $F^{(n+1)}=\rmd A^{(n)}$. This obviously
satisfies a Bianchi identity $\rmd F^{(n+1)}=0$, while, for the standard
Lagrangian proportional to $F^{\mu _1\ldots \mu _{n+1}}F_{\mu _1\ldots
\mu _{n+1}}$,  the field equation gives $\rmd {}^*F=0$. This shows that
${}^* F$ satisfies the same equations as a Bianchi identity for a
$(D-n-1)$-form field strength. Thus, it can be considered as the field
strength of a $(D-n-2)$-form. This shows the \emph{duality} between
$n$-forms and $(D-n-2)$-forms. E.g.\ in 4 dimensions this shows that a
2-form gives physically the same as a scalar, and we can thus restrict
ourselves to scalars and vectors. However, the arguments above are only
true for the simplest actions, i.e.\ with abelian gauge fields. In
non-abelian field theories, antisymmetric tensors can lead to
non-equivalent theories. The duality transformations on vectors is a
\emph{self-duality} between the components of the field strengths $F_{\mu
\nu }$ and transforms electric in magnetic components.

The usual gauge symmetries with 1-form gauge fields are the most
important ingredients of supergravity theories. For a set of gauge
transformations labelled by an index $A$, we write the transformations as
$\delta_A (\Lambda ^A)$ where $\Lambda ^A(x)$ denote the parameters. They
form an algebra as
\begin{equation}
  [\delta_A( \Lambda_1^A),\delta_B(\Lambda_2^B)] =\delta_C\left(
\Lambda_2^B\Lambda_1^A f_{AB{}^C}\right).
 \label{commutator}
\end{equation}
We discuss here bosonic transformations, but the formulas are also valid
when the parameters are fermionic, i.e.\ for supersymmetries. We need a
gauge field for any symmetry: $A_\mu{^A}$, which appear in
\emph{covariant derivatives}
\begin{equation}
 D_\mu =\partial _\mu -\delta_A(A_\mu ^A)\,, \qquad
  \delta(\Lambda) A_\mu{^A}=
\partial_\mu\Lambda^A +\Lambda^C A_\mu{^B} f_{BC{}^A}\,.
 \label{covder}
\end{equation}
The covariant derivatives involve a sum over all the symmetries.
Replacing ordinary derivatives with these covariant derivatives
eliminates the $\partial \Lambda $ terms in the variation of the action
that were discussed higher. The commutator between these covariant
derivatives give rise to \emph{curvatures}, which are the \emph{field
strength} 2-forms that we mentioned\footnote{(Anti)symmetrization is
always made with `total weight' 1, which means that
$\partial_{[\mu}A_{\nu]}="
