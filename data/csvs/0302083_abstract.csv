We study ${\cal N}=2$ $SO(2N+1)$ SYM theory in the context of matrix model.
By adding a superpotential of the scalar multiplet, $W(\Phi)$, of
degree $2N+2$, we reduce the theory to  ${\cal N}=1$.
The $2N+1$ distinct critical points of $W(\Phi)$
allow us to choose a vacuum in such a way to break the gauge group to
its maximal abelian subgroup.
We compute the free energy of the corresponding matrix model in the
planar limit and up to two vertices. This result is then used to work out
the effective superpotential of ${\cal N}=1$ theory up to one-instanton
correction. At the final step, by scaling the superpotential to zero,
the effective $U(1)$ couplings and the prepotential of the ${\cal N}=2$
theory is calculated which are in accord with the previous results.
