\abstract{A new approach to the inverse scattering problem proposed by

  two-particle scattering is described by the given $S_2$. These
  fields are polarization-free in the sense that they create one-particle states from the vacuum without polarization clouds. Thus they provide examples of temperate polarization-free generators in the presence of non-trivial interaction.}

\section{Introduction}
%==============================================================================

Within the context of collision theory the inverse scattering
problem, i.e. the reconstruction of a relativistic quantum field
theory from its scattering matrix, is one of a few remaining challenges. This
question is important for the construction of field-theoretic models
and is addressed in the framework of integrable theories in the so-called form-factor program \cite{ff}.\\
It was realized by Schroer \cite{S97} that in certain models of this
type an
intermediate step from the S-matrix to the
local quantum fields might be possible. These models admit an algebra of particle creation and annihilation operators satisfying exchange relations involving the two-particle S-matrix \cite{zamo}. Schroer argued that these operators can be combined to yield Bose-type fields which are localized in wedge-shaped regions and which create single particle states from the vacuum without accompanying polarization clouds ({\bf p}olarization-{\bf f}ree {\bf g}enerators). Because of their relations to the S-matrix, they promised to provide a
new tool in the inverse scattering problem in quantum field theory.\\
A model-independent analysis of these new objects was carried out in
\cite{BBS}. It turned out that polarization-free generators exist in
any local theory, but their subtle domain properties render them useless, in general. Assuming for example certain mild temperateness conditions, which are inevitable if one wants to do scattering theory, it was shown in \cite{BBS} that the underlying S-matrix must be trivial if the space-time dimension is larger than two. The results obtained for the
two-dimensional case indicated that temperate PFGs might well exist in
theories with a factorizing S-matrix.\\
Based on the ideas by Schroer \cite{S97, schroer}, we prove in this
article by an explicit construction, cf. also \cite{diplom}, that there are indeed two-dimensional,
factorizing theories with non-trivial interaction which allow for temperate PFGs localized in wedge regions. For notational
simplicity, we consider only one type of massive, scalar particles. Given a two-particle S-matrix $S_2$ which has to
satisfy well-known physical requirements and additionally
analyticity in the physical sheet, we construct temperate polarization-free
generators as semi-local Wightman fields which give rise to a
wedge-local theory whose two-particle scattering is described by $S_2$.\\
Section 2 introduces Zamolodchikov's algebra which is the basis for
our construction and a representation of this algebra on a Hilbert
space similar to the bosonic Fock space. In section 3 we define and
analyze the wedge-local field. Collision processes of two particles
are studied in section 4.

\section{The Zamolodchikov algebra}
%======================================================================

The starting point of our construction is the well-known
Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra \cite{zamo} which is commonly used in
the context of two-dimensional, integrable models \cite{abda}. This
algebra is described by quadratic exchange relations involving an
operator $S_2$ which is closely related to the two-particle S-matrix. Since we are dealing with the inverse
scattering problem, $S_2$ is assumed to be given.\\
We define the Zamoldchikov algebra in a somewhat abstract manner: Let
$H$ be a Hilbert space with an antiunitary involution 
$J_0=J_0^{-1}=J_0^*$
acting on it and let $S_2:H\otimes H\to H\otimes H$ be a unitary
operator which fulfills the following exchange relations with $J_0$
and the ``flip operator'' $t:H\otimes H\to H \otimes H$,
$t(\psi\otimes\varphi):=\varphi\otimes\psi$:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{scon}
  S_2 t = tS_2^*,\qquad\qquad S_2J_0^{\otimes 2}=J_0^{\otimes 2}S_2^*\;.
\end{eqnarray}
Here and in the following $A^{\otimes n}$ denotes the $n$-fold tensor
product of an operator $A$ on $H$, and $H^{\otimes n}$ is the $n$-fold
tensor product of $H$. The constraints (\ref{scon}) will translate to
physically significant properties of the two-particle S-matrix in the
representation of the Zamolodchikov algebra given below.\\
Consider the free $*$-algebra generated
by the symbols $1$, $Z(\psi),Z^{\dagger}(\psi)$, $\psi\in H$ and
$(Z\times Z)(\psi^{(2)})$, $(Z^{\dagger}\timesZ^{\dagger})(\psi^{(2)})$,
$(Z\timesZ^{\dagger})(\psi^{(2)})$, $(Z^{\dagger}\times Z)(\psi^{(2)})$,
$\psi^{(2)}\in H^{\otimes 2}$. The Zamolodchikov algebra $\mathcal{Z}(H,J_0,S_2)$ is
obtained by imposing several additional relations on this free
algebra: All symbols are assumed to depend complex linearly on
$\psi\in H$ and $\psi^{(2)}\in H^{\otimes 2}$, respectively. With respect to
multiplication in $\mathcal{Z}$ we have $1$ as the neutral element and
\begin{eqnarray}\label{z-mult}
  Z^{\dagger}(\psi)Z(\varphi) = (Z^{\dagger}\times Z)(\psi\otimes\varphi),\qquad\quad\psi,\varphi\in H,
\end{eqnarray}
and analogously for the other symbols. The star operation on $\mathcal{Z}$ is
fixed by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{star}
  1^* = 1,\qquad Z(\psi)^* = Z^{\dagger}(J_0\psi),\qquad\psi\in H\,.
\end{eqnarray}
The definition of the algebraic structure of $\mathcal{Z}$ is completed by
requiring the relations ($\varphi,\psi\in H$)
\begin{eqnarray}
  Z^{\dagger}(\varphi)Z^{\dagger}(\psi) &=& (Z^{\dagger}\times 
Z^{\dagger})(S_2^*(\psi\otimes\varphi))\label{z1}\;,\\
  Z(\varphi)Z^{\dagger}(\psi) &=& (Z^{\dagger}\times
  Z)(S_2(\psi\otimes\varphi)) + \langle J_0\varphi,\psi\rangle
  \cdot 1\;. \label{z2}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\langle.\,,\,.\rangle$ denotes the scalar product in $H$.
It should be mentioned that under the assumptions  made the exchange relation
$Z(\varphi)Z(\psi)=(Z\times Z)(S_2^*(\psi\otimes\varphi))$ holds true as
well. All these equalities are consistent because of the properties
(\ref{scon}) of $S_2$.\\ 
\\
Having defined the abstract Zamolodchikov algebra, we now turn to the
construction of a field theoretic model based on a specific
representation of $\mathcal{Z}$. For the sake of simplicity we consider here
only the case of one type of scalar particles of mass $m$, although
our results apply to a more complicated particle spectrum as well.\\
It is convenient to parametrize the momentum $p$ of a particle by the rapidity $\theta$,
\begin{equation}
 p(\theta) = m\left(
   \begin{array}{c}
     \cosh\theta\\\sinh\theta
   \end{array}
   \right)\;.
\end{equation}
We choose as our Hilbert space the rapidity space of a particle of
mass $m$, $H:=\mathcal{H}_1:=L^2({"
