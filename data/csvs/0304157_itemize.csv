\item      $r$ vacua with 
   $SU(r)  \times   U(1)^{n_c-r+1} $  gauge group  occur     only   for
$$   r  <   {n_f \over  2  }.$$
This can be understood as due to the      sign-flip of the  beta  function:    
\begin{equation}   b_0^{(dual)} \propto   -  2 \, r  +   n_f  >  0,   
\qquad       b_{0} \propto  -  2 \, n_c +    n_f  <     0,      
\label{betafund}  \end{equation} 
so that the low energy $SU(r)$ interactions are infrared-free.  Note that for this to happen 
the flavor-dressing of the monopoles  is   essential.

\item   When this sign flip is  not possible for some reason,  such as in   pure ${ N}=2$ YM or in   generic points of QMS  of ${
N}=2$  theories,       dynamical Abelianization occurs.

\item   These questions are  related to the  resolution of the old  Dirac-quantization-vs-Renormalization-Group  puzzle   (i.e., why the 
quantization condition 
 $$  g_e (\mu)  \cdot g_m(\mu) = 2 \pi n, \qquad \forall \mu   $$
is valid at any scale $\mu$?) 
in the Seiberg-Witten model.   


\item The boundary,     $r= {n_f \over 2}$ case,     is a    SCFT  (nontrivial  IR  fixed point):
    non-Abelian monopoles and dyons   still  show up as recognizable low-energy effective degrees of freedom,  although  their interactions are
nonlocal.

\item As the quark masses are chosen unequal, $m_i\ne m_j$, each of $r$  vacua  splits into  $  {n_f \choose  r}$   points in QMS.   
This is very suggestive of a possibility that the massless monopoles in each vacuum is an   (Abelian)  monopole in ${\underline  {n_f
\choose  r}}$  representation   of the global   
$SU(n_f)$. This is precisely what happens in  the  $SU(2)$  theory with  $n_f=1,2,3$. 
This would however (for generic $SU(n_c)$  theories)  lead  to an effective action 
  with an  accidental   global  $SU({n_f \choose  r})$ symmetry and hence to an enormous  number of Nambu-Golstone bosons   
when these field condense. 

\item   Actually this does not happen. The system avoids this  awkward  situation by having 
  non-Abelian  monopoles in ${\underline  {  r}}$   of  dual  color $SU(r)$, and  in the fundamental representation   ${\underline  { n_f
}}$   of  the   global 
$SU(n_f)$.    They      condense \cite{CKMP}     in color-flavor diagonal fashion
\begin{equation}   \langle  q_{\alpha }^i \rangle    =   \delta_{\alpha }^i \,  v, \qquad   \alpha =1,2,\ldots, r, \quad i=1,2,\ldots n_f
\end{equation}    
(``Color-Flavor-Locking""), breaking the global symmetry as
\begin{equation}  G_F = SU(N_f) \times U(1)  \Rightarrow   U(r) \times U(n_f-r).  \label {symbr} \end{equation} 

   
\item  The non-Abelian monopoles may be regarded as baryonic constituents of  the Abelian monopole, 
$$   U(1) \, {\hbox{\rm monopole}}   \sim   \epsilon^{a_1   \ldots  a_r} {q_{a_1}^{i_1}  q_{a_2}^{i_2}
\ldots q_{a_r}^{i_r} }.     $$
The Abelian monopole,   $SU(r)$ being  infrared free, breaks up into the former!

\item  As $u, v \to 0$,  the bitorus degenerates.   
 If the branch points   $\{ b,c,d,e,f,g  \} $  collapse to  $  ( a,a,a, 0,1,\infty) $ then  $\tau$  becomes diagonal with 
(Lebowitz \cite{lebowitz})
 $$
a={{ {\vartheta}_3}^4(0  \, |  \tau_{22} )
 \over{{ \vartheta}_2}^4(0\, | \tau_{22}   ) }; \qquad   
\frac{c-b}{d-
b}= { {{\vartheta}_3}^4(0  \, |  \tau_{11} )
 \over{{ \vartheta}_2}^4(0\, | \tau_{11}   ) }.$$


\item   In our sextet vacua the curve has the singular  form 
 $$ y^2=(x^3-u x -v)^2-x^4\to    x^4   (x+1) (x-1). $$
By an apporpriate change of the variable $x$,  one finds for 
the modular parameter   of the large  torus:   $\tau_{22} \to 1  $  (weakly interacting $U(1)$ theory);

\item  As for  the small torus  ( $SU(2)$ ),       $\tau_{11}$  apparently  depends on the way  $u,\, v $ are taken to $0$.  

\item  By studying the simplified  curve  $ (x^2-u x -v)(x^2+u x +v)=0 $  with  variable change, 
$$  v=\epsilon^2; \qquad    u=\epsilon \rho;
\qquad     x=\epsilon z; \qquad    y=\epsilon^2 w,   $$ 
one  finds that    $\tau_{11}$  depends only  on  $\rho.$  
\item In other words,   different sections  of the   linked rings  at different phase of  $\epsilon $   
are  different  ($SU(2,Z)$-related)    descriptions of the same physics!

\item  Each of the six  ${ N}=1$ theories    is  a local $U(1)^2$  theory with  a pair of massless  Abelian monopoles  $M_i, {\tilde
M}_i,$    ($i=1,2$)  carrying each unit charge with respect to one of the $U(1)$ factors; 
altogether there are  12  massless hypermultiplets (as in the SCFT);   
\item   The effect of ${ N}=1$ perturbation   $\mu \, {\hbox{\rm Tr}}  \, \Phi^2 $  can be studied in a  well-known way,   in
terms of  an effective superpotential:    
\begin{equation}  { P} =   \sum_{i=1}^2   \sqrt {2}   \, A_{D_i}  \,   M_i  {\tilde M}_i  +  \mu \,  U (A_{D1}, A_{D2})  + {\hbox {\rm mass terms }} 
\end{equation}
which leads to      $\langle M_i\rangle\ne 0$,   $\langle  {\tilde M}_i\rangle\ne 0$  (Confinement);    
\item  However,      in the     $m_i \to m $   (SCFT)   limit,  the VEVS of the Abelian monopoles   are  found to vanish: 
$$\langle M_i\rangle \to 0, \quad \langle  {\tilde M}_i\rangle \to 0.   $$  
Analogous phenomenon was found in $SU(2)$, $n_f=1$   theory \cite{GVY}.  

\item  We do know (from  the large $\mu$ analysis, vacuum counting, and holomorphic dependence of physic on $\mu$) \cite{CKMP} however 
that   the flavor group {\it is}   dynamically broken in the perturbed  SCFT vacua:
\begin{equation}   G_F =  SU(4) \times U(1)  \Rightarrow    U(2) \times U(2);    \end{equation}     
 then what is the order parameter   of the symmetry breaking?

\item   physics quite different  for 

(i)  $r =0,1$ $\Rightarrow$   Weakly coupled Abelian monopoles;

(ii)  $r<{n_f \over 2}$    $\Rightarrow$   Weakly coupled non-Abelian monopoles;

 (iii)   $ r={n_f  \over2}$    $\Rightarrow$   Strongly  coupled non-Abelian monopoles; 


\item   nonetheless, both  at  generic  $r$ - vacua  and  at the SCFT ($r={n_f \over 2}$) vacua,  the non-Abelian monopoles
condense as  
$$ \langle    { M}_{\alpha}^i  \rangle  = \delta_{\alpha}^i \, v \ne 0, \qquad  (\alpha=1,2, \ldots, r; \quad    i=1,2, \ldots, n_f)     $$
(``Color-Flavor-Locking"");  

\item  Abelian  and non-Abelian monopoles  apear to be related  as  
 $$   \epsilon^{{\alpha_1} {\alpha_2} \ldots
{\alpha_r} } { M}_{\alpha_1}^{i_1}    { M}_{\alpha_2}^{i_2}   \ldots   { M}_{\alpha_r}^{i_r}
\sim  ``U(1)""  {\hbox{\rm monopole}}. $$
