\caption{On the left is an \ofh-plane, which is linked by an \rpf\ supporting half a unit of $H$ flux and no $G_2$ flux.  The intersection of the plane with a half D6-brane is a domain wall in the worldvolume of the plane.   The half D6-brane separates regions of $G_2=0$ and $G_2=1/2$, and so on the right side of the half D6 the orientifold plane is an \ofgh.  At vanishing string coupling, the D6 is flat, but for any finite string coupling it is funnel-shaped and the intersection with the orientifold plane is at infinity.} \label{d6fig}
