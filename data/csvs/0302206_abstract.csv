Just as the single fluxbrane is quantum mechanically unstable to
the nucleation of a locally charged spherical brane, so intersecting fluxbranes are
unstable to various decay modes.  Each individual element of the
intersection can decay \emph{via} the nucleation of a spherical brane,
but uncharged spheres can also be nucleated in the region of
intersection.  For special values of the fluxes, however,
intersecting fluxbranes are supersymmetric, and so are expected to be
stable.  We explicitly consider the instanton describing the decay
modes of the two--element intersection (an F5-brane in the string theory
context), and show that in dimensions greater than four the action 
for the decay mode of the supersymmetric intersection diverges.
This observation allows us to show that stable intersecting
fluxbranes should also exist in type 0A string theory.
