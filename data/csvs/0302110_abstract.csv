We study the physics of a single discrete gravitational
extra dimension using the effective field theory for massive
gravitons. We first consider a minimal discretization
with 4D gravitons on the sites and
nearest neighbor hopping terms.
At the linear level, 5D continuum
physics is recovered correctly, but at the non-linear level
the theory  becomes highly non-local in the
discrete dimension. There is a
peculiar UV/IR connection, where the scale of strong interactions
at high energies is related to the radius of the dimension. These new effects
formally vanish in the limit of zero lattice spacing, but do not
do so quickly enough to reproduce the continuum physics consistently
in an effective field theory up to the 5D Planck scale.
Nevertheless, this model does make sense as an effective theory up to
energies parametrically higher than the compactification scale. In order to
have a discrete theory that appears local in the continuum limit,
the lattice action must have interactions between distant sites. We
speculate on the relevance of these observations to the construction of
finite discrete theories of gravity in four dimensions.
