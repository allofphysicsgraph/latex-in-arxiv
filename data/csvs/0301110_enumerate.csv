\item {\bf Highest weight discrete representations}
\[ \cD_j^+ = \left\{ |j;t \rangle : t=j,j+1, j+2, \cdots \right\} \]
where $|j;j \rangle$ is annihilated by $j_0^-$ and $j$ is a  real number such that
$1/2 < j < (k+1)/2$.

\item {\bf Lowest weight discrete representations}
\[ \cD_j^- = \left\{ |j;t \rangle : t=-j,-j-1, -j-2, \cdots \right\} \]
where $|j;-j \rangle$ is annihilated by $j_0^+$ and $j$ is a  real number such that
$1/2 < j < (k+1)/2$.

\item {\bf Continuous representations}
\[ \cCo_j = \left\{ |j,\alpha;t \rangle : t= \alpha, \alpha \pm 1,\alpha \pm 2, \cdots \right\} \]
where $0 \leq \alpha < 1$ and $j = 1/2 + \textrm{i} z $, where $z$
is a real number.
