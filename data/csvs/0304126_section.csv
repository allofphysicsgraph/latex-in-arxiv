\appendix{Useful Formulae for KT Geometry}


Let $(X_n, J, G)$ be a KT manifold, i.e. $X_n$ is a hermitian manifold of
complex dimension $n$
with metric $G$ and complex structure $J$ such that $\nabla^{(+)}J=0$, where
$\nabla^{(+)}$ has skew-symmetric torsion $H$.  In the mathematics literature
$\nabla^{(+)}$ is called the Bismut connection.
 The holonomy of  $\nabla^{(+)}$
is contained in $U(n)$. In complex coordinates, the holonomy
condition requires $\Gamma^{(+)}_i{}^\alpha{}_{\bar \beta}=0$ which in
turn gives
\be
H_{\alpha\beta\bar\gamma}=-\partial_\alpha G_{\beta\bar\gamma}
+\partial_\beta G_{\alpha\bar\gamma}~.
\label{ktto}
\ee
The rest of the components of the torsion are determined by complex conjugation.
The (3,0) and (0,3) components of $H$ vanish as it can be seen
from the integrability of the complex structure.
 So $H$ is determined
uniquely in terms of the metric and complex structure of $(X_n, J, G)$.
The Lee form of the KT geometry is
$$
\theta_i={1\over2} J^j{}_i H_{jkl} \Omega^{kl}~,
$$
where $\Omega_{ij}= G_{ik} J^k{}_j$ is the K\""ahler form.
In complex coordinates, the Lee form can be written as
\be
\theta_\alpha=\partial_\alpha{\rm ln}\det(G_{\beta\bar\gamma})- G^{\beta\bar\gamma}
\partial_\beta G_{\alpha\bar\gamma}
\label{ktth}
\ee
and $\theta_{\bar\alpha}= (\theta_\alpha)^*$.

The connection of the canonical bundle
induced by $\nabla^{(+)}$   is
\be
\omega_\alpha= i\Gamma^{(+)}{}_\alpha{}^\beta{}_\beta-
i\Gamma^{(+)}{}_\alpha{}^{\bar\beta}{}_{\bar\beta}=2i G^{\beta\bar\gamma}
\partial_\beta G_{\alpha\bar\gamma}-i G^{\beta\bar\gamma}\partial_\alpha G_{\beta\bar\gamma}
\label{ktuo}
\ee
and $\omega_{\bar\alpha}=(\omega_\alpha)^*$. Let $\rho=d\omega$ be the
curvature of the 
$U(1)$ connection $\omega$. The holonomy of the connection $\nabla^{(+)}$
is contained in $SU(n)$, iff $\rho=0$.



A KT manifold is conformally balanced iff there is a function $\Phi$ on $X_n$
such that $\theta=2d\Phi$, i.e. the Lee form is exact.
It has been shown in \cite{gpsib} that if
$(X_n, J,G)$ is a conformally balanced KT manifold and
the holonomy of $\nabla^{(+)}$
is contained in $SU(n)$ ($\rho=0$), then
\be
R_{ij}+{1\over4} H^k{}_{il} H^l{}_{jk}
+2\nabla_i\partial_j\Phi= {1\over4} J^k{}_i (dH)_{kjmn} \Omega^{mn}~,
\label{ktfeq}
\ee
where $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric $G$. Note that
we do  {\sl not} require $dH=0$ in the above expression.

Our conventions for the curvature
of a connection $\Gamma$ are
$$
R_{ij}{}^k{}_l=\partial_i \Gamma^k_{jl}-\partial_j \Gamma^k_{il}+\Gamma^k_{im} \Gamma^m_{jl}-
\Gamma^k_{jm} \Gamma^m_{il}
$$
and the Ricci tensor is $R_{ij}=R_{mi}{}^m{}_j$.







\appendix{Lichnerowicz and Laplace operators}

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold with associated Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$.
The Lichnerowicz operator $\Delta_L$ is defined by
$$
R_{ij}(g+\epsilon h)= R_{ij}+\epsilon \Delta_L h_{ij}
+O(\epsilon^2)~.
$$
So $\Delta_L$ is the first-order deformation of the Ricci tensor.
A calculation reveals that
\bea
\Delta_Lh_{ij}=&-&{1\over2}\nabla^2 h_{ij}- R_{ik jl} h^{kl}
+{1\over2}\nabla_i\nabla^kh_{kj}+
{1\over2}\nabla_j\nabla^kh_{ki}
\cr
&-&{1\over2}\nabla_i\nabla_j h^k{}_k+{1\over2} R_{ki} h^k{}_j+{1\over2} R_{kj} h^k{}_i
\label{lop}
\eea
The Laplacian operator $\Delta$ on a two form $Y$ is
$$
\Delta Y_{ij}=-{1\over2} \nabla^k \nabla_k Y_{ij}-R_{ikj\ell} Y^{k\ell}+{1\over2}
R_{ik} Y^k{}_j-{1\over2}R_{jk} Y^k{}_i~.
$$
On Ricci-flat K\""ahler manifolds, we can relate the  Lichnerowicz operator
 to the Laplace operator on two-forms
by choosing  the gauge fixing condition
$$
\nabla^j h_{ji}-{1\over2} \nabla_i h^j{}_j=0
$$
 for infinitesimal diffeomorphisms and by 
using the relation $Y_{ij}=h_{ik} J^k{}_i$
 between symmetric (1,1)-tensors and (1,1)-forms. The Hermiticity
 condition for the metric implies that the deformations $h$ of the
 metric are (1,1) tensors.

Note that the above gauge can always be attained.
Suppose that $h$ does not satisfy the gauge.
Assume that there is an infinitesimal diffeomorphism $v$ such that
 $h'_{ij}=h_{ij}+\nabla_i v_j+\nabla_j v_i$
 satisfies the gauge. Then $v$ is determined by the equation
$$
\nabla^k \nabla_k v_i=\nabla^j h_{ji}-{1\over2} \nabla_i h^j{}_j~.
$$
To show that  there is always such a $v$, we must
invert  the above equation. This can be achieved iff
$\nabla^j h_{ji}-{1\over2} \nabla_i h^k{}_k$ is orthogonal to the kernel of the
elliptic operator $\nabla^k \nabla_k$. We rewrite the above equation as
$$
(d\delta+\delta d) V=-\nabla^j Y_{ji}+{1\over2} J^k{}_i \nabla_k h^j{}_j~,
$$
where $V_i= v_k J^k{}_i$ and $\delta$ is the adjoint of $d$.
Of course this equation can be inverted iff the right-hand-side is orthogonal
to harmonic one-forms.  Indeed let $Z$ be a harmonic one-form, then
$$
\int_M Z^i\left(-\nabla^j Y_{ji}+{1\over2} \Omega_{ki} \nabla^k h^j{}_j\right)
d{\rm vol}=
-\int_M \left(\nabla_i Z_j Y^{ij} +{1\over2} \nabla_i Z_j~ \Omega^{ij}~ h^k{}_k
\right) d{\rm vol}=0
$$
because $Z$ is closed.


 \appendix{Another derivation of the field equations for (2,0) compactifications}

 The first-order corrections $(h, f, \phi)$ to the background of a Calabi-Yau
 compactification $(g, \varphi)$, $T=0$, can be determined
 by the field equations without using
 the conditions for spacetime supersymmetry. To show
 this, we substitute (\ref{expeq}) in the
field equation (\ref{feq}) and collect the linear terms in $\alpha'$.
Using the fact that at zeroth order in $\alpha'$ the geometry is Calabi-Yau,
the equation for the metric gives
\beq
\Delta_Lh_{ij}+ S_{ij} +2\nabla_i \partial_j\phi=0~,
\label{eina}
\eeq
where $\Delta_L$ is the Lichnerowicz
operator (see appendix B).  In this case, we have
\beq
\Delta_Lh_{ij}=-{1\over2}\nabla^2 h_{ij}-
 R_{ik jl} h^{kl}+{1\over2}\nabla_i\nabla^kh_{kj}+
{1\over2}\nabla_j\nabla^k h_{ki}
-{1\over2}\nabla_i\nabla_j h^k{}_k
\label{lop}
\eeq
because $X_n$ is Calabi-Yau and $R_{ij}=0$,
and
\beq
S_{ij}={1\over4}[ R_{iklm} R_j{}^{klm}
- F_{ikab} F_j{}^{kab}]
\label{ann}
\eeq
The covariant derivative $\nabla$ in (\ref{eina}) and (\ref{lop})
and the curvature $R$ are  with respect to the Calabi-Yau metric $g$.


To solve equation (\ref{eina}) with respect to
$h$, we shall exploit the well-known relation between the
Lichnerowicz and Laplace operators
on Calabi-Yau manifolds. There are two ways to do this.
One is to use the scheme dependence
of the two-loop beta function and the other is to impose a gauge fixing condition
on the deformations $h$ of the metric $g$. The latter is common in moduli problems
in order for the deformation $h$ to be orthogonal to the orbits of infinitesimal
diffeomorphisms.
Using the scheme dependence of the two-loop beta function, we can 
arrange so that
the term
$$
{1\over2}\nabla_i\nabla^kh_{kj}+{1\over2}\nabla_j\nabla^kh_{ki}
+{1\over2} r \nabla_i \partial_j h^k{}_k
$$
is cancelled  by a wave function renormalization, where $r$ is a real number.
Alternatively, one can impose the gauge fixing condition
$$
\nabla^k h_{ki}+ {r\over 2} \nabla_i h^k{}_k=0~.
$$
Provided that we set for the deformation of the dilaton
$$
\phi={1\over 4} (r+1) h^k{}_k~,
$$
the remaining equation is
\beq
-{1\over2}\nabla^2 h_{ij}- R_{ik jl} h^{kl}+S_{ij}=0~.
\label{lap}
\eeq
To solve this equation observe that $S$ is a (1,1) symmetric tensor with respect to the
complex structure. This allows us to consider deformations of the metric which
are (1,1) as well, i.e. to take $h$ to be a (1,1) symmetric tensor.
It is well known that on K\""ahler manifolds there is a 1-1 correspondence between
symmetric (1,1) tensors and (1,1) two-forms. Indeed define the  forms
$Y_{ij}=h_{ik} J^k{}_j$ and $Z_{ij}=S_{ik} J^k{}_j$ associated to $T$ and $S$.
Equation (\ref{lap}) becomes
\beq
\Delta Y+Z=0
\label{lapa}
\eeq
where
$$
\Delta Y_{ij}=-{1\over2} \nabla^k \nabla_k Y_{ij}-R_{ikj\ell} Y^{k\ell}
$$
is the standard Laplace operator on $Y$ (see appendix B). We have
taken into account that Calabi-Yau manifolds are Ricci-flat, $R_{ij}=0$.
So it remains to invert the
Laplace operator to determine $Y$ in terms of $Z$.

To solve the equation (\ref{lapa}) in terms of $Y$, we have to show that
$Z$ is orthogonal to
the harmonic two-forms of $X_n$ in the Hodge decomposition with respect to the
Calabi-Yau metric $g$. This can be achieved by relating
the two-loop contribution $Z$ to the beta function of the metric, to the
heterotic anomaly $P$. Using
$$
\Omega^{ij} R_{ijkl}=\Omega^{ij} F_{ij ab}=0~,
$$
we can show that
$$
Z_{ij}={1\over4} P_{ijmn} \Omega^{mn}~.
$$
Now suppose that $n=3$. After some computation, we find that
$$
Z_{ij}=-{1\over 2} {}^*P_{ij}+{1\over 16} \Omega_{ij} P_{mnpq} \Omega^{mn} \Omega^{pq}~.
$$
The cancellation of the global anomaly implies that $P$ is exact.
As a consequence the dual two-form ${}^*P$ is co-exact and
so it is orthogonal to harmonic two-forms. It remains to show that
$P_{mnpq} \Omega^{mn} \Omega^{pq}$
is not harmonic.  Observe  that a harmonic function on $X_3$ is a non-vanishing constant.
Integrating the identity
$$
P\wedge \Omega={1\over8} P_{mnpq} \Omega^{mn} \Omega^{pq} d{\rm vol}
$$
over the compact manifold $X_3$ and using that $P$ is exact, it is easy
to see that $P_{mnpq} \Omega^{mn} \Omega^{pq}$ is not harmonic.



This result can be easily extended to four- and eight-dimensional
internal manifolds.  The $n=2$ case has been
investigated in \cite{hpap}. For
$n=4$, the computation is similar to $n=3$. The only difference
is the relation between the two-loop counterterm and the anomaly.


Next we  investigate the field equation of the three-form field strength.
Again substituting (\ref{expeq}) in (\ref{feq}) and
collecting the terms linear in $\alpha'$, we find
$$
\nabla^i f_{ijk}=0\
$$
or equivalently
$$
d^\dagger f=0~,
$$
where $d^\dagger$ is the adjoint operator of $d$.
To derive this, we have used the fact that $H$ vanishes at
zeroth order  in $\alpha'$. In addition, we have that  $df=-P$; $f$
is well-defined because $P$ is exact.
Using the Hodge decomposition, we can write
$$
f=f_h+dX+d^\dagger W
$$
where $f_h$ is harmonic and $W$ is a four-form.
Adding the counterterm
$$
b=-\alpha' X\ ,
$$
the exact three-form $dX$ can be eliminated as follows
$$
H=-\alpha' dX+\alpha' f= \alpha' f_h+\alpha' d^\dagger W~.
$$
Thus the field equation is satisfied and $dH=-P$.
Alternatively, one can choose $f$ such that $f=f_h+d^\dagger W$.
