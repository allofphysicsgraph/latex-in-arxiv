Motivated by the work of Mersini, the particle production related
to the tunneling in false vacuum decay is carefully investigated
in the thin-wall approximation. It is shown that in this case the
particle production is exponentially suppressed even when the
momentum is comparable to the curvature scale of the bubble. The
number of created particles is ultraviolet finite.
