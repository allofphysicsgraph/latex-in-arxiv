We take as starting point the planar model arising from the dimensional
reduction of the Maxwell Electrodynamics with the (Lorentz-violating)
Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. We then write and study the extended Maxwell
equations and the corresponding wave equations for the potentials. The
solution to these equations show some interesting deviations from the usual
MCS Electrodynamics, with background-dependent correction terms. In the case
of a time-like background, the correction terms dominate over the MCS
sector\ in the region far from the origin, and establish the behaviour of a
massless Electrodynamics (in the electric sector). In the space-like case, the
solutions indicate the clear manifestation of spatial anisotropy, which is
consistent with the existence of a privileged direction is space. \
