consisting of left and right KdV equations coupled on the cylinder
is derived from an integrable lattice field theory. The eigenvalues
of the energy and of the transfer matrix (and of all the other local integrals of motion) are expressed in
terms of the corresponding solutions of the nonlinear integral
equation. The analytic and asymptotic behaviours of the transfer matrix are studied and given.
