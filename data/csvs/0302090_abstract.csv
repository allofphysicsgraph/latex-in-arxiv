The Wilsonian renormalization group (WRG) equation is used to derive 
a new class of scale invariant field theories with nonvanishing 
anomalous dimensions in $2$-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric 
nonlinear sigma models. When the coordinates of the target manifolds 
have nontrivial anomalous dimensions, vanishing of the $\beta$ function 
suggest the existence of novel conformal field theories whose target 
space is not Ricci flat.
We construct such conformal field theories with ${\bf U}(N)$ symmetry. 
The theory has one free parameter $a$ corresponding to the anomalous 
dimension of the scalar fields. The new conformal field theories are 
well behaved for positive $a$ and have the central charge $3N$, while 
they have curvature singularities at the boundary for $a<0$. When the 
target space is of complex $1$-dimension, we obtain the explicit form 
of the Lagrangian, which 
reduces to two different kinds of free field theories in weak and 
in strong coupling limit. As a consistency test, the anomalous dimensions 
are reproduced in these two limits. The target space in this case looks 
like a semi-infinite cigar with one-dimension compactified to a circle.
