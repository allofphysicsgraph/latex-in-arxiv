We work out the decomposition of the indefinite Kac Moody algebras
${E_{10}}$ and ${E_{11}}$ w.r.t. their respective subalgebras $A_9$ and $A_{10}$
at low levels. Tables of the irreducible representations with their 
outer multiplicities are presented for ${E_{10}}$ up to level $\ell = 18$ 
and for ${E_{11}}$ up to level $\ell =10$. On the way we confirm and extend 
existing results for ${E_{10}}$ root multiplicities, and for the first time 
compute non-trivial root multiplicities of ${E_{11}}$.
