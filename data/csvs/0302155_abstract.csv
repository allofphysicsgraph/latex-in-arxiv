\noindent We consider a massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling
in $\mathbf{S}^{1}\times \mathbf{S}^{3}$ space, which mimics the
thermal expanding universe, and calculate explicitly all relevant 
thermodynamical
functions in the low- and high-temperature regimes, extending previous
analysis of entropy bounds and entropy/energy ratios performed in the conformal
case. For high temperatures, new mass-dependent
entropy ratios are established which, differently to the conformal limit,
 fulfil Bekenstein's and  Verlinde's bounds in the physical region. \\
