It was recently pointed out that the physics
of a single discrete gravitational extra dimension
exhibits a peculiar UV/IR connection relating 
the UV scale to the radius of the effective extra dimension.
Here we note that this non-locality is a manifestation 
of holography, encoding the correct scaling of the number
of fundamental degrees of freedom of the UV
theory. This in turn relates the Wilsonian
RG flow in the UV theory to the effective 
gravitational dynamics in the extra dimension.
The relevant holographic c-function is determined
by the expression for the holographic bound.
Holography in this context is a result of the requirements of 
unitarity and diffeomorphism invariance.
We comment on the relevance of this observation
for the cosmological constant problem.
