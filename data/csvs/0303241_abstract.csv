After recalling episodes from Pascual Jordan's biography including his pivotal
role in the shaping of quantum field theory and his much criticized conduct
during the NS regime, I draw attention to his presentation of the first phase
of development of quantum field theory in a talk presented at the 1929 Kharkov
conference. He starts by giving a comprehensive account of the beginnings of
the new quantum theory and then passes to his recent discovery of quantization
of ``wave fields'' and problems of gauge invariance. The most surprising
aspect of Jordan's presentation is however his strong belief that his field
quantization is a transitory not yet optimal formulation of the principles
underlying causally localizable quantum physics. The expectation of a future
more radical change coming from the main architect of field quantization
already shortly after his discovery is certainly quite startling.

I try to answer the question to what extend Jordan's 1929 expectations have
been vindicated. The larger part of the present essay consists in arguing that
Jordan's plea for a formulation without ``classical correspondence crutches'',
i.e. for an intrinsic approach without the classical parallelism called
quantization, is successfully addressed in past and recent publications on
local quantum physics.
