\abstract{Explicit supersymmetry breaking is studied in higher 
dimensional theories by having boundaries respect only a subgroup 
of the bulk symmetry. If the boundary symmetry is the maximal 
subgroup allowed by the boundary conditions imposed on the fields, 
then the symmetry can be consistently gauged; otherwise gauging 
leads to an inconsistent theory. In a warped fifth dimension, 
an explicit breaking of all bulk supersymmetries by the boundaries 
is found to be inconsistent with gauging; unlike the case of flat 5D, 
complete supersymmetry breaking by boundary conditions is not consistent 
with supergravity. Despite this result, the low energy effective theory
resulting from boundary supersymmetry breaking becomes consistent 
in the limit where gravity decouples, and such models are explored 
in the hope that some way of successfully incorporating gravity 
can be found. A warped constrained standard model leads to a theory 
with one Higgs boson with mass expected close to the experimental 
limit. A unified theory in a warped fifth dimension is studied with 
boundary breaking of both $SU(5)$ gauge symmetry and supersymmetry. 
The usual supersymmetric prediction for gauge coupling unification 
holds even though the TeV spectrum is quite unlike the MSSM. 
Such a theory may unify matter and Higgs in the same $SU(5)$ 
hypermultiplet.}
