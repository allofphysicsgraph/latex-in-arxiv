The contraction of a spin-1/2 representation of the de~Sitter group SO(3,2) 
yields a translation operator that consists of the usual momentum operator 
plus a second order term, the ``momentum spin"" as described by F. G\""ursey. 
The contribution of momentum spin to the kinematics of a multiparticle system 
in a tangential space of anti de~Sitter space is analyzed. It is shown that
it can be described by a perturbation term with the structure of the 
interaction term of quantum electrodynamics. 
An evaluation of the corresponding coupling constant reproduces Wyler's
heuristic formula for the electromagnetic coupling constant.
