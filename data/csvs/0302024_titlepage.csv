\begin{abstract}

The problems of attempting inflationary model-building in a theory
containing a dilaton are explained. In particular, I study the shape
of the dilaton potential today and during inflation, based on a
weakly-coupled heterotic string model where corrections to the
K\""ahler potential are assumed to be responsible for dilaton
stabilization. Although no specific model-building is attempted, if
the inflationary energy density is related to the scale of gaugino
condensation, then the dilaton may be stabilized close enough to
today's value that there is no significant change in the GUT scale
coupling. This can occur in a very wide range of models, and helps to
provide some justification for the standard predictions of the
spectral index. I explain how this result can ultimately be traced to
the supersymmetry structure of the theory.
