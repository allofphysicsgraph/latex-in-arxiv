An inflationary brane model driven by a bulk inflaton with exponential 
potential is proposed. We find a family of exact solutions that describe
power-law inflation on the brane. These solutions enable us to derive  
exact solutions for metric perturbations analytically. By calculating 
scalar and tensor perturbations, we obtain a spectrum of primordial 
fluctuations at 
the end of the inflation. The amplitudes of scalar and tensor 
perturbations are enhanced in the same way if
the energy scale of the inflation is sufficiently higher than the 
tension of the brane. Then the relative amplitude of scalar and 
tensor perturbations is not suppressed even for high-energy inflation. 
This is a distinguishable feature from the inflation model driven by 
inflaton on the brane where tensor perturbations are suppressed for 
high-energy inflation.  We also point out that massive Kaluza-Klein 
modes are not negligible at high-frequencies on 3-space of our 
brane.
