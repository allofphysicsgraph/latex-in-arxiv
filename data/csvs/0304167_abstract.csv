The topology of configuration space may be responsible
in part for the existence of sphalerons. Here, sphalerons are defined to be
static but unstable finite-energy solutions of the classical field equations.
Another manifestation of the nontrivial topology of configuration
space is the phenomenon of spectral flow for the eigenvalues of the
Dirac Hamiltonian. The spectral flow, in turn, is related to the
possible existence of anomalies. In this review,
the interconnection of these topics is illustrated for three
particular sphalerons of $SU(2)$ Yang--Mills--Higgs theory.
