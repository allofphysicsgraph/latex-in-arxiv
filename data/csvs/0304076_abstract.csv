Schwarzschild black hole being thermodynamically unstable, corrections
to its entropy due to small thermal fluctuations cannot be
computed. However, a thermodynamically stable Schwarzschild solution
can be obtained within a cavity of any finite radius by immersing it
in an isothermal bath. For these boundary conditions, classically
there are either two black hole solutions or no solution. In the
former case, the larger mass solution has a positive specific heat and
hence is locally thermodynamically stable.  We find that the entropy
of this black hole, including first order fluctuation corrections is
given by: ${\cal S} = S_{BH} - \ln[\f{3}{R} (S_{BH}/4\p)^{1/2}
-2]^{-1} + (1/2) \ln(4\p)$, where $S_{BH}=A/4$ is its
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and $R$ is the radius of the cavity. We
extend our results to four dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""om black
holes, for which the corresponding expression is: ${\cal S} = S_{BH} -
\f{1}{2} \ln [ { (S_{BH}/\p R^2) ( {3S_{BH}}/{\p R^2} -
2\sqrt{{S_{BH}}/{\p R^2 -\a^2}} ) \le( \sqrt{{S_{BH}}/{\p R^2}} - \a^2
\ri) }/ {\le( {S_{BH}}/{\p R^2} -\a^2 \ri)^2 } ]^{-1} +(1/2)\ln(4\p).$
Finally, we generalise the stability analysis to Reissner-Nordstr\""om
black holes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions, and compute their
leading order entropy corrections. We find that in contrast to
previously studied examples the entropy corrections in these cases
have a dissimilar character.
