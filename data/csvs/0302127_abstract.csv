We study superstring theories on the Penrose limit of 
the enhan\c{c}on geometry realized by 
the $D(p+4)$-branes wrapped on a $K3$ surface.
We first examine the null geodesics with fixed radius 
in general brane backgrounds, which  give solvable superstring 
theories with constant masses. In most cases, the superstring 
theories contain negative mass-squared.
We clarify a condition that the world-sheet free fields 
have positive mass-squared.
We then apply this condition to the enhan\c{c}on geometry and 
find that the null geodesics with fixed radius exist
only for $p=0$ case.
They define the superstring theories with positive
mass-squared.
For $p>0$ case, we show that there is no null geodesic with fixed
radius.
We also discuss the decoupling limit
which gives the dual geometry of super Yang-Mills theory
with 8 supercharges. We discuss the $K3$-volume 
dependence of the superstring spectrum.
