\item  Unlike vacuum QFT the analytic properties of spacetime or momentum
space correlation functions cannot be described in terms of different boundary
values one holomorphic ``master function''; this complicates in particular the
relation between the imaginary time (Matsubara formalism) and real time
correlation functions. Even though Lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken,
the continued validity of relativistic causality leads to an enlargement of
KMS analyticity which was only recently noticed (the relativistic KMS property
in \cite{B-B2}).

\item  Contrary to the vacuum theory where (at least in the case of mass-gaps)
the LSZ scattering theory allows a description in the Fock space of the
asymptotic particles without encountering infrared divergencies, real time
infinite volume thermal theories calculated perturbatively starting from free
thermal propagators lead to perturbative infrared problems. Whereas
ultraviolet problems in renormalizable theories tend to be of technical origin
(cavalier use of singular pointlike fields), difficulties in the infrared
invariably point to an insufficient physical understanding. This problem was
recently addressed by a concrete proposal on the asymptotic behavior
\cite{B-B3} which takes into account the fact that some interaction dependent
dissipative effects are asymptotically persistent. This proposal if used in
perturbation theory, should avoid infrared problems; a task which still has to
be carried out.
