We investigate the vacuum expectation values for the
energy-momentum tensor of a massive scalar field with general
curvature coupling and obeying the Robin boundary condition on a
spherical shell in the $D+1$-dimensional global monopole
background. The expressions are derived for the Wightman function,
the vacuum expectation values of the field square, the vacuum
energy density, radial and azimuthal stress components in both
regions inside and outside the shell. A regularization procedure
is carried out by making use of the generalized Abel-Plana formula
for the series over zeros of cylinder functions. This formula
allows us to extract from the vacuum expectation values the parts
due to the global monopole gravitational field in the situation
without a boundary, and to present the boundary induced parts in
terms of exponentially convergent integrals, useful, in
particular, for numerical calculations. The asymptotic behavior of
the vacuum densities is investigated near the sphere surface and
at large distances. We show that for small values of the parameter
describing the solid angle deficit in global monopole geometry the
boundary induced vacuum stresses are strongly anisotropic.
