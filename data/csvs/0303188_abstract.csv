The dynamics and radiation of positronium is investigated in intense laser fields. %, with emphasis placed on 
%peculiaries due to the equal masses and opposite charges of its two constituents.
 Our two-body quantum mechanical treatment displays the tunneling, free-evolution and recollision
dynamics of electron and positron both in the oscillating laser electric and laser magnetic field 
components. In spite of significant momentum transfer of the numerous incoming laser photons, 
recollisions of both particles are shown to occur automatically after tunneling ionization, along 
with substantial x-ray and gamma-ray emission during recombination and annihilation processes.
