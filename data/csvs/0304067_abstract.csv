In this paper we give explicit first order Lagrangian formulation for
mixed symmetry tensor fields $\Phi_{[\mu\nu],\alpha}$,
$T_{[\mu\nu\alpha],\beta}$ and $R_{[\mu\nu],[\alpha\beta]}$. We show
that such Lagrangians could be written in a very suggestive form
similar to the well known tetrad formalism in gravity. Such
description could simplify the investigations of possible interactions
for these fields. Some examples of interactions are given.
