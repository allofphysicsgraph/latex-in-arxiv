\noindent It is well known that, due to vanishing theorems, there
are no nontrivial finite action solutions to the Abelian
Seiberg-Witten (SW) monopole equations on Euclidean
four-dimensional space $\mathbbm{R}^4$. We show that this is no
longer true for the noncommutative version of these equations,
i.e. on a noncommutative deformation $\mathbbm{R}^4_\theta$ of 
$\mathbbm{R}^4$ there exist smooth solutions to the SW equations 
having nonzero topological charge. We introduce
 action functionals for the noncommutative SW equations and 
construct explicit regular solutions. 
All our solutions have finite energy. We also suggest a possible 
interpretation of  
the obtained solutions as codimension four
vortex-like solitons representing $D(p-4)$- and 
$\overline{D(p-4)}$-branes in a $Dp$-$\overline{Dp}$ brane system in
type II superstring theory.
