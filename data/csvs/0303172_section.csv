\section{Tachyonic S-brane Action}
\label{appa}

In this appendix, we explicitly demonstrate how the tachyonic
S-branes considered in Section \ref{vortex} appear in the tachyon
condensation of D-brane anti-D-brane. In Fig.~\ref{descentt},
this is the arrow (2). Since the arrow (1) has already been
discussed in Ref.~\cite{Sbraneaction}, while the arrow (3) is just the
same as the usual D-brane descent relation, and the arrow (4) was
realized in Section \ref{vortex}, the derivation of (2) completes
the explanation of the generalized descent relations of
Fig.~\ref{descentt}.

To derive the effective action of the ``tachyonic S-brane'' by
using the fluctuation analysis of the time dependent kink as
performed in Ref.~\cite{Sbraneaction}, we return to the Lagrangian of
the D-\Dbar\ pair in Eq.~(\ref{BSFT}) and the solution
representing  the tachyonic S-brane in Eq.~(\ref{solts}). A
direct analysis of this fluctuation mode is difficult due to the
complexity of the Lagrangian.

The easiest way to proceed is to simplify the situation and
truncate the derivatives of the Lagrangian at fourth order
\begin{eqnarray}
S={2T_{\rm  D9}} \int d^{10} x \ e^{-|T|^2} \left(1+  |\partial_\mu
T|^2 + p_1 \left(|\partial_\mu T|^2\right)^2 +p_2 (\partial_\mu T)^2(\partial_\nu
\bar{T})^2 \right) ,
\label{dertru}
\end{eqnarray}
where $T\equiv T_1+iT_2$ and $p_1, p_2$ are numerical constants.
We must keep at least fourth order derivative terms since if we
only keep the usual canonical kinetic energy there are no tachyon
solution linear in time, and unless the solution is linear it is
again technically difficult to perform a fluctuation analysis.
The equation of motion for a homogeneous time dependent
tachyon is
\begin{eqnarray}
- T_1 (1+\dot{T}_1- 3 p \dot{T}_1^4) +\ddot{T}_1(1-6 p
\dot{T}_1^2)=0 ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $p\equiv p_1+p_2$, and we have set $T_2=0$. Therefore the
linear solution
\begin{eqnarray}
T_{\rm{cl}}=a x^0 , \label{linearsolu}
\end{eqnarray}
exits for $a=\sqrt{\frac{1+\sqrt{1+12p}}{6p}}$.

It is actually strange that we have completely linear solution in
spite of the presence of the tachyon potential. The higher-order
kinetic term makes this situation possible. The general solution
does not exhibit the rolling tachyon behavior at late time, since
this model is just a generalization of the Minahan-Zwiebach model
which does not possess the rolling tachyon behavior. The general
solution reaches the true vacuum $T=\infty$ in finite time. But
if we tune the initial condition then we have the completely
linear solution for the rolling tachyon. The strangeness of this
solution is also apparent in that its energy vanishes
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\cal E} =
\int e^{-|T|^2} (1+\dot{T}_1- 3 p \dot{T}_1^4)=0.
\end{eqnarray}
For the meantime we treat this special solution as just an
illustration of the new descent relations.

\noindent
\underline{Fluctuation spectrum}

\noindent
Let us consider the following fluctuation
\begin{eqnarray}
T=T_{\rm{cl}} (x^0) +t_1 (x^\mu) +i t_2(x^\mu),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mu = 0,1,\cdots,9$. Substituting this into the action and
collecting terms quadratic in the fluctuation fields, we obtain
the fluctuation action
\begin{eqnarray}
S_{\rm{fluc}}=&&{}\hspace{-20pt}
{2T_{\rm  D9}}\int\! d^{10}x \; e^{-T_{\rm{cl}}^2}
\left[
(\frac{4}{3}-\frac{2}{3} a^2)\big((2a^2 x_0^2 -1 )t_1^2
-t_2^2\big)
-\frac{8-4a^2}{3}x_0 t_1\dot{t}_1
\right.
\\
&&\hspace{10mm}
\left.+\frac{a^2-2}{3a^2}(\partial_\mu t_1)^2+\frac{4(1+a^2)}{3a^2}
\dot{t}_1^2 +(1-2a^2p_1+2a^2p_2)(\partial_\mu t_2)^2+4p_2a^2\dot{t}_2^2
\right].
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The two fluctuation modes are completely decoupled from each
other.  Integrating by parts, we find that
\begin{eqnarray}
&& S_1  ={2T_{\rm  D9}}\int\! d^{10}x\; e^{-T_{\rm{cl}}^2} \left[
\frac{a^2-2}{3a^2} (\partial_\mu t_1)^2+\frac{4(1+a^2)}{3a^2}
 \dot{t}_1^2
\right], \\
&& S_2 ={2T_{\rm  D9}}\int\! d^{10}x\; e^{-T_{\rm{cl}}^2} \left[
\left(\!-\frac{4}{3}+\frac{2}{3}a^2\!\right)
t_2^2 + (1-2a^2p_1+2a^2p_2)(\partial_\mu
t_2)^2+4p_2a^2\dot{t}_2^2 \right] . \quad \hspace{5mm}
\end{eqnarray}
To see the physical meaning of these fluctuations, we redefine
the fields as $\hat{t}_{1,2}= e^{-(ax^0)^2/2} t_{1,2}$ so the
newly defined fields $\hat{t}_{1,2}$ have canonical kinetic
terms. Then we can decompose the fields $\hat{t}_{1,2}(x^\mu)$
into the eigenfunctions of the harmonic potential along $x^0$, as
performed in Ref.~\cite{Sbraneaction}.   We may determine the ``mass''
spectra for these fluctuations as the eigenvalues of the
Laplacian, $\partial_i^2$, for the spatial directions.

The $t_1$ fluctuation contains a zero mode which is the Nambu-Goldstone
mode
associated with the symmetry breaking of the translation along
$x^0$ by the presence of the kink solution. The `mass' tower of
$t_1$ is obtained as
\begin{eqnarray}
m^2=\frac{8a^2(1+a^2)}{a^2-2} n, \quad n=0,1,\cdots .
\end{eqnarray}
The constant $a$ should be less than $\sqrt{2}$ to keep the
coefficient of the term $(\partial_\mu  t_1)^2$ negative.

Next, we use the field redefinitions to rewrite the action $S_2$
as
\begin{eqnarray}
S_2={2T_{\rm  D9}}\!\int\! d^{10}x
\left[(1\!-\!2a^2p_1\!+\!2a^2p_2)(\partial_i \hat{t}_2)^2
+\frac{2\!-\!a^2}{3a^2}
\hat{\dot{t}}_2^2+\frac{a^2(2\!-\!a^2)}{3a^2}x_0^2 \hat{t}_2^2
+(a^2\!-\!2)\hat{t}_2^2 \right].
\end{eqnarray}
{}From this expression it is easy to extract the mass spectrum
\begin{eqnarray}
m^2=\frac{2-a^2}{3a^2(1-2a^2p_1+2a^2p_2)} \left[
a\sqrt{\frac{2-a^2}{3}}(2n+1)+a^2-2 \right] .
\end{eqnarray}
Here again $1-2a^2p_1+2a^2p_2>0$ should be satisfied so that the
fluctuation Lagrangian is positive definite. The lowest mode
becomes tachyonic, and this tachyonic mode is associated with the
instability of the time-dependent kink solution.


\vspace{5mm}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent
\underline{Effective action}

\noindent The lowest modes in the fluctuations $\hat{t}_{1,2}$
are Gaussian, and if one expresses these in term of the original
fluctuation then they are actually constant, independent of
$x^0$. Using this property, we can calculate the effective action
for the tachyonic S-brane. By substitution of the fluctuation
into the original D-\Dbar\ action, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
S\!\!&&={2T_{\rm  D9}}\int\! dx_0 \;e^{-(ax_0+t_2)^2} \int d^9x
\Big[
1-a^2 +(\partial_i
t_1)^2 +(\partial_i t_2)^2
\bigg.
\nonumber \\
&& \hspace{5mm}
+p_1 \Big(a^4-2a^2(\partial_i t_1)^2-2a^2(\partial_i t_2)^2 \Big)
+p_2 \Big(a^4-2a^2(\partial_i t_1)^2+2a^2(\partial_i t_2)^2 \Big)
\Big]
\nonumber
\\
&&={2T_{\rm  D9}}\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{a} \int d^9x e^{-t_2^2} \Big[
\frac{2}{3}(2-a^2) -\frac{2-a^2}{a^2} (\partial_i
t_1)^2+(1-2a^2p_1+2a^2p_2) (\partial_i t_2)^2
\nonumber
\\
&& \hspace{35mm}
+\big((\partial t)^4\rm{term}\big) \Big].
\label{tsac}
\end{eqnarray}
(In the last line we have performed the integration over $x^0$.)
This is the tachyonic S-brane effective action, which resembles a
Minahan-Zwiebach model \cite{Zwie}.
The difference between them are as
follows: (1) the sign of $(\partial_i t_1)^2$ term  is negative,
indicating that this mode represents the translation along the
time direction. (2) the worldvolume metric defining this theory
is Euclidean. These two properties are shared with the S-brane
action obtained in our previous paper.

Although we have adopted a derivative truncation as the starting
point (\ref{dertru}) and also a special solution
(\ref{linearsolu}), we believe that this effective action
(\ref{tsac}) may capture essential features of the tachyonic
S-branes.

\section{Evaluation of Tachyon Energy of Boosted S-brane}
\label{appb}
\setcounter{footnote}{0}

Though the energy of the (deformed) S-brane configurations has
been studied in Section \ref{sfs}, Section \ref{dfs}, and
Ref.~\cite{Sbraneaction}, the overall normalization of the S-brane
action has not been specified there. This can be fixed in
principle in the derivation of the S-brane actions in Section
\ref{vortex} and
Ref.~\cite{Sbraneaction}. It is clear that the factor
$S_0$ in Ref.~\cite{Sbraneaction},
which is an ``S-brane tension,'' can
be computed by substituting the rolling tachyon solution into the
original tachyon action.   This tension $S_0$ is not therefore
fixed since it is dependent on the rolling tachyon energy
${\cal E}$.
This situation is different from the case of static tachyon
defects of D-branes where the tension is fixed completely.

Let us evaluate $S_0$ using the BSFT Lagrangian as a starting
point.\footnote{So far, among many tachyonic Lagrangians, only
the BSFT Lagrangians reproduce the D-brane tensions correctly and
consistently.} The BSFT action of a non-BPS D2-brane is\footnote{We have
rescaled the tachyon from that of Ref.~\cite{BSFTmatter} as
$T \rightarrow T/\sqrt{4\pi}$. }
\begin{eqnarray}
 S_{\rm nonBPS} = -{\cal T}_2 \int d^3x \; e^{-\pi T^2}
\sqrt{-\det(\eta + F)} {\cal F}\left(z\right),
\label{tacacnd2}
\end{eqnarray}
where the worldvolume coordinates are $x^0, x^1, \chi$ and
\begin{eqnarray}
 z \equiv G^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu T \partial_\nu T.
\end{eqnarray}
We are working in the units $2\pi\alpha'=1$, and $G_{\mu\nu}$ is
the open string metric. The function ${\cal F}$ is defined by
BSFT and its explicit form is given in
Refs.~\cite{BSFT,BSFTsoliton,BSFTRR} for example. The properties of
this ${\cal F}$,
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\cal F}(z) \sim -\frac12 \frac1{z+1} \quad (z \sim -1)
\label{expansion}
\end{eqnarray}
will turn out to be important later.

For vanishing field strength the homogeneous rolling tachyon
solution $T=T_{\rm cl}(x^0)$ presented in Ref.~\cite{BSFTmatter} has
an asymptotic expansion for large $x^0$
\begin{eqnarray}
 T_{\rm cl}(x^0)= x^0 + \epsilon(x^0)
+ \mbox{higher},
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
 \dot{\epsilon}(x^0) =
\sqrt{\frac{ {\cal T}_2 }{{4}{\cal E}}}
\exp\left[-\frac{\pi}{2}(x^0)^2\right].
\end{eqnarray}
Here ${\cal E}$, the energy density of the above homogeneous
rolling tachyon solution, is defined by the following Hamiltonian
density formula
\begin{eqnarray}
 H =  {\cal T}_2 \;e^{-\pi{T_{\rm cl}}^2}
\sqrt{-\det(\eta + F)} \left[
{\cal F}(z) - \dot{T} \frac{\delta z}{\delta \dot{T}}
\frac{\delta {\cal F}(z)}{\delta z}\right].
\label{densityformula}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that $T_{\rm cl}(x^0)$ is a function dependent
on the integration constant ${\cal E}$ implicitly. The S-brane
tension $S_0$ is just the value of the action (\ref{tacacnd2})
into which the solution $T_{\rm cl}$ is substituted (while the
integration over the spatial worldvolume is left unperformed, to
give the worldvolume of the S-brane). Although the complexity of
the function ${\cal F}(z)$ obstructs the analytic evaluation of
the action, we can read off the integrand in the asymptotic
region $x^0\sim\infty$. Noting that $z$ approaches $-1$ in this
limit
\begin{eqnarray}
 z \sim -1 -
\sqrt{\frac{ {\cal T}_2 }{\cal E}}
\exp\left[-\frac{\pi}{2}(x^0)^2\right],
\end{eqnarray}
we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
 L_{\rm nonBPS}
\sim -{\cal T}_2\;
e^{-\pi (x^0)^2}\left(-\frac12\right)
\left[
-\sqrt{\frac{ {\cal T}_2 }{\cal E}}
\exp\left[-\frac{\pi}{2}(x^0)^2\right]
\right]^{-1}
=
-\frac{\sqrt{{\cal E}{{\cal T}_2 }}}{2}
e^{-\pi (x^0)^2/2}.
\end{eqnarray}
This means that the value of $S_0$, which is given by the
integral of $L_{\rm nonBPS}$ over $x^0$, is in fact finite and
may be approximated as
\begin{eqnarray}
 S_0 \sim
-\frac{\sqrt{{\cal E}{{\cal T}_2 }}}{2}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \! dx^0\;e^{-\pi (x^0)^2/2}
=- \sqrt{\frac{{\cal E}{{\cal T}_2}}{2}}.
\label{stension}
\end{eqnarray}

Let us move on to the evaluation of the energy of the boosted
S-brane which is a timelike object. It is straightforward to show
that the rolling tachyon solution in the presence of a constant
magnetic field is also a solution of the non-BPS D2-brane system
(\ref{tacacnd2}),
\begin{eqnarray}
 T = T_{\rm cl}(x^0), \quad F_{1\chi}={\rm const.}
\end{eqnarray}
Basically we can turn on the constant field strength transverse
to the S-brane freely. Next, consider the boosted solution
\begin{eqnarray}
 T = T_{\rm cl}\left({x^0}'\right), \quad F_{1\chi}= \mbox {const.}
\label{boostsolution}
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
 {x^0}' \equiv x^0 \cosh \gamma  + x^1\sqrt{G_{11}} \sinh\gamma.
\label{locS}
\end{eqnarray}
Here the open string metric is
\begin{eqnarray}
 G_{\mu\nu} = {\rm diag}(-1,1+F_{1\chi}^2, 1+F_{1\chi}^2).
\end{eqnarray}
One can show that (\ref{boostsolution}) is again a
solution\footnote{The nontrivial check is
on the equations of motion for the gauge fields. The tachyon
equation of motion is trivially satisfied since we made a boost
respecting the open string metric.} of the non-BPS D2-brane
system (\ref{tacacnd2}).  In the limit
\begin{eqnarray}
 F_{1\chi} \rightarrow \infty
\label{Flimit}
\end{eqnarray}
the S-brane becomes timelike and in this case the tachyon
configuration is approximately
\begin{eqnarray}
 T \sim \left( \sqrt{G_{11}} \sinh \gamma\right) x^1,
\end{eqnarray}
which resembles
the usual D-string kink solution.
This suggests that the energy is localized at $x^1=0$.

We keep this in mind and proceed to carefully evaluate the
Hamiltonian at $x^0=0$ for simplicity. The asymptotic expansion
of $T_{\rm cl}$ at $x^0=0$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
 T =  \sinh \gamma \sqrt{G_{11}} x^1 +
\sqrt{\frac{{\cal T}_2}{4{\cal E}}} \exp \left[
-\frac{\pi}{2}(\sinh\gamma \sqrt{G_{11}} x^1)^2 \right]+ {\rm
higher}
\end{eqnarray}
and this approximation is very good for nonzero $x^1$ and large
$F_{1\chi}$. For this solution the argument $z$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
 z = \left(
-\dot{T}^2 + G^{11} (\partial_1 T)^2
\right)
= ... = - \left( T_{\rm cl}'\right)^2
\end{eqnarray}
where ${'}$ denotes a derivative with respect to the argument of the
function $T_{\rm cl}$, i.e. in the above
\begin{eqnarray}
 T_{\rm cl}' \equiv \left[
\frac{\delta T_{\rm cl}(a)}{\delta a}
\right]_{a = \cosh \gamma x^0 + \sinh \gamma \sqrt{G_{11}} x^1}.
\end{eqnarray}
Since $T'_{\rm cl}$ approaches $1$, $z$ approaches $-1$ everywhere
except $x^1=0$ in the limit $F_{1\chi} \rightarrow \infty$. This means
that in the evaluation of the energy $\delta{\cal F}/\delta z$
(the second term in (\ref{densityformula})) is
much larger than ${\cal F}$ (first term in (\ref{densityformula})) due
to the expansion (\ref{expansion}),
so the Hamiltonian at
$x^0=0$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
 H \hspace{-15pt}&&={\cal T}_2 \exp\left[
-\pi (\sinh\gamma\sqrt{G_{11}} x^1)^2
\right]
\sqrt{-\det (\eta + F)}\;
2(\dot{T})^2 \frac{\delta {\cal F}(z)}{\delta z}
\nonumber\\
&& =
{\cal T}_2 \exp\left[
-\pi(\sinh\gamma\sqrt{G_{11}} x^1)^2
\right]
\sqrt{1\!  +\! F_{1\chi}^2}
\; 2(\cosh^2\gamma) ({T}_{\rm cl}')^2
\frac{\delta {\cal F}(z)}{\delta z}
\nonumber\\
&& =
{\cal T}_2 \exp\left[
-\pi (\sinh\gamma\sqrt{G_{11}} x^1)^2
\right]
\sqrt{1\!  +\! F_{1\chi}^2}
\; 2(\cosh^2\gamma)
\frac{1}{\frac{2{\cal T}_2}{\cal E} \exp\left[
-\pi (\sinh\gamma \sqrt{G_{11}}x^1)^2
\right]}\nonumber \\
&&
= {\cal E}\sqrt{1+F_{1\chi}^2} \cosh^2\gamma.
\label{bakene}
\end{eqnarray}
This is independent of $x^1$, and we have shown that the background
rolling tachyon energy is still present everywhere even in the limit
$F_{1\chi} \rightarrow \infty$.
(The above result is consistent with the original rolling tachyon with
$F_{1\chi}=0$ and $\gamma=0$, since this should give the energy
${\cal E}$.)

Let us consider higher order terms in the Hamiltonian to see the
localization of the energy which should correspond to the energy of the
boosted S-brane.
In the limit (\ref{Flimit}), it turns out
that the next-to-leading order term coming
from the expansion of the potential term $e^{-\pi T^2}$
can be ignored.
First, we expand the function $z$ for large $x^1$ at
$x^0=0$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
 z = -1 - \sqrt{\frac{{\cal T}_2}{\cal E}}
\exp \left[
-\frac{\pi}{2} (\sinh\gamma \sqrt{G_{11}} x^1)^2
\right]
-\frac{{\cal T}_2}{\cal E}
\exp \left[
-\pi (\sinh\gamma \sqrt{G_{11}} x^1)^2
\right]
+ \mbox {higher}.
\end{eqnarray}
Then the Hamiltonian is
evaluated to the next-to-leading order as
\begin{eqnarray}
 H &=& {\cal E}\sqrt{1+F_{1\chi}^2} \cosh^2\gamma
\left[1\;\;-\;\;\frac12 \sqrt{\frac{{\cal T}_2}{{\cal E}} }
\exp \left[
-\frac{\pi}{2} (\sinh\gamma \sqrt{G_{11}} x^1)^2
\right]
\right]
\nonumber
\\
&&
\hspace{10mm}
+ \frac12 \sqrt{{\cal ET}_2}
\sqrt{1+F_{1\chi}^2}
\exp \left[
-\frac{\pi}{2} (\sinh\gamma \sqrt{G_{11}} x^1)^2
\right]
+ \mbox{higher.}
\end{eqnarray}
Here
the second term in the first
line is from the higher order evaluation of $\delta {\cal F}/\delta z$
in (\ref{densityformula}), while
the second line comes from evaluation of ${\cal F}(z)$ term in the
Hamiltonian (\ref{densityformula}).
Interestingly, though these two exponential terms
become infinitely small in the limit $F_{1\chi}\rightarrow \infty$,
they are combined and approach a $\delta$ function whose coefficient is
finite. More
precisely, the above expression is arranged in this limit as
\begin{eqnarray}
 H
= {\cal E}\sqrt{1+F_{1\chi}^2} \cosh^2\gamma
-\sqrt{\frac{{\cal E}{\cal T}_2}{2}}|\sinh\gamma| \delta(x^1).
\label{resultenergy}
\end{eqnarray}
So, in addition to the homogeneous energy of the background rolling
tachyon, we have a localized energy with a finite coefficient!
This second term should be identified with the energy of the boosted
S1-brane.

We now show that the localized energy contribution we just
calculated agrees with the Hamiltonian of the S1-brane action.
The action of a static S1-brane located at $x^1=0$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
 S_{\rm S1} = S_0 \int\! dx^0 dx^1 d\chi \;
 \delta (x^1)\sqrt{E^2-1}.
\end{eqnarray}
Using this action, one finds that
the S1-brane Hamiltonian density is
\begin{eqnarray}
 H_{\rm S1} = S_0 \frac{1}{\sqrt{E^2-1}}\; \delta (x^1).
\label{SH}
\end{eqnarray}
Now this electric field $E$ is the induced electric field as seen
in Eq.~(\ref{inducedE}). After taking the limit
$F_{1\chi}\rightarrow \infty$, we have $ E = -\coth \gamma$.
Substituting this into the S-brane Hamiltonian (\ref{SH}), we
obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
 H_{\rm S1} = S_0|\sinh\gamma|\;\delta (x^1).
\end{eqnarray}
Remarkably this agrees with the finite energy contribution in
Eq.~(\ref{resultenergy}) using the S-brane tension of
Eq.~(\ref{stension})!

Lastly we provide a comment on this localized energy. In the final
expression (\ref{resultenergy}), the S-brane contribution was
found to be negative. This suggests that the S-brane has a
negative energy, which agrees with the result of the boundary
state analysis in which the time-time component of the boosted
S-brane boundary state is given by a negative value as opposed to
the usual boundary states for $(p,1)$ strings.  In this appendix
we have shown why this does not result in any of the usual
problems.  While the contribution of the S-brane is negative,
there is an additional leading order energy contribution in
Eq.~(\ref{resultenergy})
which is due to the energy of the background
rolling tachyon,
and so the total energy is still positive.

The picture is reminiscent of anti-particles in the ``Dirac sea''.
The boosted S-brane is like something existing in a cloud of
fundamental strings. Since our non-BPS D-brane formulation did
not take care of the radiation of the fundamental strings, it
keeps the energy and effect of all these strings which are
supposed to radiate away. (One of the effects of this cloud of
fundamental strings might possibly be to make the S-brane
energy negative.)
Actually, the string cloud will dissipate, and the S-brane with
strings attached to it will become a D-brane with strings
attached to it.
(Here we have to distinguish the strings on
the non-BPS D-brane which will decay away,
from strings stuck to the S-brane.)
As a final remark,
the energy of the background rolling tachyon
in (\ref{bakene}) diverges in the limit
$F_{1\chi}\rightarrow \infty$. The validity of
some of the calculations are not so rigorous
due to this singular limit. Although the boosted S-brane is expected to
capture the late time behaviour of the spike solution in
Section \ref{sfs}, apparently this divergence
comes from the fact that we have
not taken into account the curved worldvolume of the S-brane in the
spike solution where $F_{1\chi}$ is divergent only at $r=0$. In this
sense the correspondence between the spike solution and the boosted
S-brane is not exact.
