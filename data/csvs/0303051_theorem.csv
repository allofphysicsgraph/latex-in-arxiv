%
The $\hat{Q}$-cohomology can be non-zero only at $ \hat{N}^{\rm g} =0 $, {\it i.e.}, 
\begin{equation}
%
H^n(\hat{\cal H}, \hat{Q})=0 \quad \mbox{for} \quad n\neq 0

\end{equation}
if the matter part of $ {\cal H} $ can be decomposed as a sum of two Verma modules as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:hilbert}). \label{thm:vanishing}
