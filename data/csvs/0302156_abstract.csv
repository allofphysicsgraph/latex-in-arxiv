Recently it was conjectured by Gibbons and Townsend that the large $n$ limit of
an $N=4$ superconformal extension of the $n$--particle Calogero model might provide a
microscopic description of the extreme Reissner--Nordstr\""om black hole near the horizon.
In this paper a possibility to construct an $SU(1,1|2)$ invariant extension
of the Calogero model is considered. We treat in detail the two--particle case and
comment on some peculiarities intrinsic to $n>2$ generalizations.
