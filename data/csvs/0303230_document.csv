\section{Introduction}


Supersymmetric string compatifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds 
are usually characterized 
by having continuous families of solutions that satisfy the string equations
of motion, this family is called the moduli space of a compactification.
One can move inside the family by exciting closed string 
fields, and since the total change of energy is zero, these fields are 
massless. These massless fields are scalars with respect to the four 
dimensional physics, and are called moduli.

It is believed that non-perturbative effects can cause an effective 
superpotential on the moduli space which lifts the degeneracy of these vacua
\cite{Wnp}, 
and leaves behind a finite number of supersymmetric vacua. 
Thus there
is no true moduli space, but only an asymptotic region where some
of the moduli fields can be considered to be very light. This is usually a region with
 runaway behavior, and moduli roll towards
ten dimensional flat space.

Most of the full structure of moduli space is inaccessible to 
computations because the string dilaton is one of the moduli, and 
we have very little 
understanding of the theory at strong coupling to determine the 
structure 
of the moduli space and the superpotential on it. 

In most circumstances all we understand is an expansion of the theory about 
a weak coupling point, and we are forced to look for solutions which do 
not stray too far from the weak coupling regime.

For most results however, one can not sum the full set of
non-perturbative corrections, and the effective superpotential on the moduli 
space is given roughly by
\begin{equation} 
W_{eff} = W_1+W_2+\hbox{Other uncontrolled non-perturbative corrections}
\end{equation}
where one believes $W_1$ and $W_2$ dominate in some region of moduli 
space. Here, we explicitly write two contributions that are associated with 
distinct dependence on the closed string dilaton, so that one can
 balance the two effects and produce a finite vev for the dilaton,
 hopefully  in a perturbative regime for the calculation of some 
quantities 
(this has been called a racetrack scheme. It was discussed originally
in \cite{Kras}. For a 
more recent discussion
see \cite{DS}).

In this paper we will explore toy models for
 moduli stabilization in supersymmetric 
field theories. The main points of the paper are to exploit the recent 
advances in describing the structure of supersymmetric vacua by 
matrix models \cite{DV}, and to geometrize the 
field theory behavior into aspects of the geometry 
of a system of D-branes, so that we can come into contact with the 
stabilization of moduli for more geometric setups. At the same time, 
retaining just a field theory calculation and decoupling gravity 
and the dilaton, because we are taking a non-compact Calabi-Yau 
geometry.

The main advantage of the setup described in this paper is that it can be 
argued to be exact, due to their 
relations to matrix models. In this sense it is now 
possible to make certain arguments on the whole moduli space of a 
theory, 
instead of a more
usual procedure of taking limits in various regions where different
 manipulations give a tractable answer \cite{IT}.

This program should be viewed as baby steps towards producing vacua 
as described in the work of Kachru et al. \cite{KKLT}, 
where first one describes a supersymmetric 
compactification, and at the very end one adds anti-D3 branes to break 
supersymmetry on an F-theory 
geometry. this finla step produces
a De-Sitter like vacuum in string theory. It has been 
argued by Susskind \cite{S} based on ideas by Bousso and Polchinski
\cite{BP}
that there is possibly a very large number  of these models.   
Under these circumstances 
it is important to understand under what conditions can
one trust the calculations that one is performing. See also the recent 
discussion by Douglas \cite{Dou}, where an attempt is made to count vacua.



The paper is organized as follows:

In section \ref{sec:general} we study the topology of moduli spaces 
and the conditions under which classical moduli spaces can be lifted by 
quantum corrections. We argue that there need to be singularities in 
codimension one on the classical moduli space for this to happen.
In section \ref{sec:ADS} we give a D-brane realization 
of the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg system by putting a collection of fractional 
branes on a ${"
