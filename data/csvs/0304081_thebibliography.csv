\bibitem{key} Field configurations similar to the one considered in
  this article may variously be encountered under names such as:
  ``localized waves'', ``focus wave modes'', ``pulses'', ``X-waves'',
  ``limited diffraction beams'', ``wavelets'', and ``physical
  wavelets''.
  
\bibitem{Lorenz} The Lorenz gauge was apparently first used by the
  Danish physicist Ludwig Lorenz (1829-1891), though it is commonly
  misattributed to the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz
  (1853-1928).
