We describe the classical $o(3,2)$ $r$-matrices as generating the
quantum
 deformations of either D=3 conformal algebra with mass-like deformation
parameters
 or D=4 $AdS$ algebra with dimensionless  deformation parameters.
 We describe the quantization of classical $o(3,2)$ $r$-matrices
   via Drinfeld twist
method which locates the deformation in the coalgebra sector.
 Further we obtain
  the quantum $o(3,2)$  algebra
  in
  a convenient Hopf algebra form
 by considering suitable deformation maps from classical to deformed
  $o(3,2)$ algebra basis. It appears that
   if we pass from $\kappa$-deformed D =3 conformal algebra basis to
   the deformed
      D=4 $AdS$ generators
    basis
    the role
   of dimensionfull parameter  is taken over by the $AdS$ radius $R$.
    We provide also
     the bilinear $o(3,2)$ Casimir  which we express using the
 deformed D=3 conformal  basis.
