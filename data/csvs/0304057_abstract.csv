We consider a blown-up 3-brane, with the resulting geometry $R^{(3,1)}
\times S^{(N-1)}$, in an infinite-volume bulk with $N > 2$ extra
dimensions. The action on the brane includes both an Einstein term and
a cosmological constant. Similar setups have been proposed both to
reproduce 4-d gravity on the brane, and to solve the cosmological
constant problem. Here we obtain a singularity-free solution to
Einstein's equations everywhere in the bulk and on the brane, which
allows us to address these question explicitely. One finds, however,
that the proper volume of $S^{(N-1)}$ and the cosmological constant on
the brane have to be fine-tuned relatively to each other, thus the
cosmological constant problem is not solved. Moreover the scalar
propagator on the brane behaves 4-dimensionally over a
phenomenologically acceptable range only if the warp factor on the
brane is huge, which aggravates the Weak Scale -- Planck Scale
hierarchy problem.
