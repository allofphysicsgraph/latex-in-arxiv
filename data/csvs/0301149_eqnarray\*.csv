$\alpha$ and $\beta$; we hope to determine them imposing the third

as a Casimir system \cite{birrell}. Two one-dimensional ``walls""
at a proper distance (between them) $L$ are placed at
points\hspace{1ex} $r_1$ and $r_2$. The massless scalar field
whose energy-momentum tensor we try to evaluate satisfies the
Dirichlet boundary conditions on the ``walls'', i.e.
$\phi(r_{1})=\phi(r_{2})=0$.

\noindent {\bf (i) Boulware Vacuum}
\newline
In this vacuum there are no particles detected at infinity
($\mathcal{J}^+$) and the regularized stress tensor (\ref{em3})
should coincide at infinity with the sum of the standard Casimir
stress tensor \cite{birrell,fulling} in the Minkowski spacetime
\begin{equation} T^{\mu}_{\nu}=\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}} \left[\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right] \label{emb} \end{equation} and of the stress tensor of the
gravitational field of the AdS$_{2}$ space \begin{eqnarray} T^{\mu
(\mbox{\tiny{AdS}})}_{\nu}&=& \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\displaystyle{-\frac{r^2}{2\left(-M+\Lambda r^{2}
\right)}}&\displaystyle{0}
\\ \displaystyle{0}&\displaystyle{\frac{r^2}{2\left(-M+\Lambda r^2
\right)^2}}\end{array}\right]\nonumber\\
&=&\frac{r^{2}}{2\left(-M+\Lambda r^{2}
\right)}\left[\begin{array}{cc} -1 & 0 \\
0 & 1\end{array}\right]\label{adsstress1}\end{eqnarray} since the
Achucarro-Ortiz black hole is asymptotically an AdS$_{2}$ space.
\newline The constants of integration $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
evaluated demanding the regularized stress tensor given in
(\ref{em3}) to coincide at infinity, i.e. $r\rightarrow +\infty$,
with the sum of the above-mentioned stress tensors (\ref{emb}) and
(\ref{adsstress1}).
\par
\noindent Therefore we get  \begin{equation} \alpha = 0 \hspace{1cm}\beta =
\left(\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi}+\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}\right)
g_{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}(r)
+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\Lambda^{2}}{24\pi}\right)r^{2}+D
 \end{equation} and the regularized stress tensor has
been explicitly calculated. It can also be written as a direct sum
\begin{equation}
T^{(\eta)\mu}_{\nu}=T^{\mu}_{\nu(gravitational)}+T^{\mu}_{\nu(boundary)}+T^{\mu}_{\nu(ANFG)}
\label{sum1}\end{equation} where $\eta$ denotes that the regularized stress
tensor has been calculated under the assumption that there are no
particles (vacuum state) at infinity (Boulware vacuum). The first
term denotes the contribution to the vacuum polarization due to
the non-trivial topology in which the contribution of the trace
anomaly is included, the second term denotes the contribution due
to the presence of the two ``Dirichlet walls'' and the third term
denotes the contribution due to the asymptotically non-flat
geometry (ANFG) of the Achucarro-Ortiz black hole.
\par
The detected energy density, pressure and energy at infinity
($r\rightarrow +\infty$ are given by
 \begin{eqnarray} \rho=T^{(\eta)t}_{t}&=&-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}\label{d1}\\
p=-T^{(\eta)x}_{x}&=&-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}-\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi}\label{p1}\\
E(L)=\int^{r_2 =r_1 +L}_{r_1}\rho dr &=&
-\frac{\pi}{24L}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}L\label{energy1}\hspace{1ex}.
\end{eqnarray} The corresponding Casimir force between the ``walls'' is not
always attractive as expected  \begin{equation} F(L)=-\frac{\partial
E(L)}{\partial
L}=-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}+\frac{1}{2\Lambda}\label{f1}\hspace{1ex}.
\end{equation} It is clear that the Casimir force is

\newline
In this vacuum the Achucarro-Ortiz black hole
(\ref{metric1})-(\ref{metric2}) is in thermal equilibrium with an
infinite reservoir of black body radiation at temperature $T$
which is equal to its Hawking temperature. The regularized stress
tensor (\ref{em3}) should coincide with the following stress
tensor  \begin{equation} T^{\mu}_{\nu}=\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right]+\frac{r^{2}}{2\left(-M+\Lambda r^{2}

\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right ]\hspace{1ex} \end{equation}  where the last term is the stress tensor
for a two-dimensional black hole in thermal equilibrium at
temperature $T$ \cite{christensen}.
\newline The constants of integration $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
evaluated demanding the regularized stress tensor given in
(\ref{em3}) to coincide at infinity, i.e. $r\rightarrow +\infty$,
with the sum of the above-mentioned stress tensors (\ref{emb}) and
(\ref{adsstress1}).
\par
\noindent Therefore we get  \begin{eqnarray} \alpha &=& 0 \\
\beta
&=&\left(\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi}+\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}+\frac{\pi}{6}
\left(T_{H}^{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}\right)^{2} \right)

}{24\pi}M\right) g_{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}(r)
+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\Lambda^{2}}{24\pi}\right)r^{2}+D  \end{eqnarray}
and the regularized energy-momentum tensor has been explicitly
calculated. It can also be written as a direct sum \begin{equation}
T^{(\upsilon)\mu}_{\nu}=T^{\mu}_{\nu(gravitational)}+T^{\mu}_{\nu(boundary)}+
T^{\mu}_{\nu(ANFG)}+T^{\mu}_{\nu(bath)} \label{sum2}\end{equation} where
$\upsilon$ denotes that the regularized stress tensor has been
calculated under the assumption that massless particles (black
body radiation) are detected at infinity (towards
$\mathcal{J}^{+}$) (Hartle-Hawking vacuum) and the fourth term in
equation (\ref{sum2}) denotes the contribution to the vacuum
polarization due to the thermal bath at temperature $T_{H}$.
\par
In this vacuum the asymptotically ($r\rightarrow +\infty$)
detected energy density, pressure and energy at infinity are given
by
 \begin{eqnarray} \rho=T^{(\eta)t}_{t}&=&-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}-\frac{\Lambda}{24\pi}M\label{d2}\\
p=-T^{(\eta)x}_{x}&=&-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}-\frac{\Lambda}{24\pi}M-\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi}\label{p2}\\
E(L)=\int^{r_2 =r_1 +L}_{r_1}\rho dr &=&
-\frac{\pi}{24L}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}L -\frac{\Lambda }{24\pi}M
L\label{energy2}\hspace{1ex}. \end{eqnarray} The corresponding Casimir force
between the ``walls'' is not always attractive as expected : \begin{equation}
F(L)=-\frac{\partial E(L)}{\partial
L}=-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}+\frac{1}{2\Lambda}+\frac{\Lambda}{24\pi}M\label{f2}\hspace{1ex}.
\end{equation} It is clear that the Casimir force is :
\begin{description}
\item \hspace{2cm}{\bf (a) attractive}
\begin{equation} L < \pi \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi +\Lambda^{2} M }}\end{equation}
\item \hspace{2cm}{\bf (b) zero} \begin{equation} L = \pi \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi +\Lambda^{2} M }}\end{equation}
\item \hspace{2cm}{\bf (c) repulsive}
\begin{equation} L > \pi \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi +\Lambda^{2} M
}}\hspace{1ex}.\end{equation}
\end{description}
Thus, if the last condition is satisfied the outer ``Dirichlet
wall'' moves towards infinity. It can be studied as a ``moving
mirror'' creating particles whose energy rate detected at infinity
is given by the third term in equation (\ref{energy2}): \begin{equation}
\frac{dE}{dt}=\frac{\Lambda}{24 \pi}M L =\frac{\pi
L}{6}\left(T_{H}^{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}\right)^{2}\hspace{1ex}. \end{equation}
This is the rate at which energy is radiated for the case of the
massless two-dimensional field \cite{emparan1,emparan2}.

\noindent {\bf (iii) Unruh Vacuum}
\newline
In this vacuum an outward flux of radiation is detected at
infinity. Thus, since the Achucarro-Ortiz black hole
(\ref{metric1})-(\ref{metric2}) radiates and its spectrum
distribution is thermal at the Hawking temperature $T_{H}$
\cite{hawking2,hawking3}, the Unruh vacuum state is identified
with the vacuum obtained after the Achucarro-Ortiz black hole has
settled down to an ``equilibrium'' of temperature $T_{H}$. The
regularized stress tensor (\ref{em3}) should now coincide at
infinity with the following stress tensor \begin{equation}
T^{\mu}_{\nu}=\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}} \left[\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}
\right]+\frac{r^{2}}{2\left(-M+\Lambda r^{2}
\right)}\left[\begin{array}{cc} -1 & 0 \\
0 & 1\end{array}\right]+\frac{\pi
\left(T_{H}^{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}\right)^{2} }{12} \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & -1\\
1 & 1
\end{array}
\right ]\hspace{1ex} \end{equation}  where the last term is the stress tensor
for a radiating two-dimensional black hole which has settled down
to an ``equilibrium'' of temperature $T_{H}$ \cite{christensen}.
\newline The constants of integration $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
evaluated demanding the regularized stress tensor given in
(\ref{em3}) to coincide at infinity, i.e. $r\rightarrow +\infty$,
with the sum of the above-mentioned stress tensors (\ref{emb}) and
(\ref{adsstress1}).
\par
\noindent Therefore we get  \begin{eqnarray} \alpha &=& \frac{\pi
\left(T_{H}^{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}\right)^{2}
}{12}g^{-\frac{1}{2}}_{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}(r)e^{\frac{1}{4}g^{2}_{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}(r)}
=\frac{\Lambda
}{48\pi}M g^{-\frac{1}{2}}_{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}(r)e^{\frac{1}{4}g^{2}_{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}(r)}\\
\beta
&=&\left(\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi}+\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}+\frac{\pi}{12}
\left(T_{H}^{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}\right)^{2} \right)
g_{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}(r)
+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\Lambda^{2}}{24\pi}\right)r^{2}+D\nonumber\\
&=& \left(\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi}+\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}+\frac{\Lambda
}{48\pi}M\right) g_{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}(r)
+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\Lambda^{2}}{24\pi}\right)r^{2}+D  \end{eqnarray}
and the regularized stress tensor has been explicitly calculated.
It can also be written as a direct sum \begin{equation}
T^{(\xi)\mu}_{\nu}=T^{\mu}_{\nu(gravitational)}+T^{\mu}_{\nu(boundary)}+
T^{\mu}_{\nu(ANFG)}+T^{\mu}_{\nu(radiation)} \label{sum3}\end{equation} where
$\xi$ denotes that the regularized stress tensor has been
calculated under the assumption that massless particles are
detected at infinity due to the Hawking radiation of the
Achucarro-Ortiz black hole (Unruuh vacuum) and the fourth term in
equation (\ref{sum3}) denotes the contribution to the vacuum
polarization due to Hawking radiation at temperature $T_{H}$.
\par
In this vacuum the asymptotically ($r\rightarrow +\infty$)
detected energy density, pressure and energy at infinity are given
by
 \begin{eqnarray} \rho=T^{(\eta)t}_{t}&=&-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}-\frac{\Lambda}{48\pi}M\label{d3}\\
p=-T^{(\eta)x}_{x}&=&-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}-\frac{\Lambda}{48\pi}M-\frac{\Lambda}{12\pi}\label{p3}\\
E(L)=\int^{r_2 =r_1 +L}_{r_1}\rho dr &=&
-\frac{\pi}{24L}-\frac{1}{2\Lambda}L -\frac{\Lambda }{48\pi}M
L\label{energy3}\hspace{1ex}. \end{eqnarray} The corresponding Casimir force
between the ``walls'' is not always attractive as expected : \begin{equation}
F(L)=-\frac{\partial E(L)}{\partial
L}=-\frac{\pi}{24L^{2}}+\frac{1}{2\Lambda}+\frac{\Lambda}{48\pi}M\label{f3}\hspace{1ex}.
\end{equation} It is clear that the Casimir force is :
\begin{description}
\item \hspace{2cm}{\bf (a) attractive}
\begin{equation} L < \pi \sqrt{\frac{2\Lambda}{24\pi +\Lambda^{2} M }}\end{equation}
\item \hspace{2cm}{\bf (b) zero} \begin{equation} L = \pi \sqrt{\frac{2\Lambda}{24\pi +\Lambda^{2} M }}\end{equation}
\item \hspace{2cm}{\bf (c) repulsive}
\begin{equation} L > \pi \sqrt{\frac{2\Lambda}{24\pi +\Lambda^{2} M
}}\hspace{1ex}.\end{equation}
\end{description}
As in the case of the Hartle-Hawking vacuum, if the last condition
is satisfied the outer ``wall'' moves towards infinity. It can be
studied as a ``moving mirror'' creating particles whose energy
rate detected at infinity is given by the second term in equation
(\ref{energy3}): \begin{equation} \frac{dE}{dt}=\frac{\Lambda}{48 \pi}M L
=\frac{\pi
L}{12}\left(T_{H}^{\mbox{\tiny{AdS}}}\right)^{2}\hspace{1ex}. \end{equation}
This is the rate at which energy is radiated for the case of the
massless two-dimensional field \cite{emparan1,emparan2}.

\section{Stability and Cosmological Constant}
It is obvious that in the case that the net force which the
``Dirichlet walls'' experience turns out to be repulsive the
system will be uninteresting since it will be decompactified as
$L\rightarrow \infty$. On the other hand, if the net forced
exerted on the ``Dirichlet walls'' turns out to be attractive then
the system inevitably will evolve in such a way that at some
finite time the distance $L$ will be of order of the Planck length
where our semiclassical analysis adopted here will no longer be
valid. Therefore the case of a zero net force on the ``Dirichlet
walls'' sounds the most interesting for our scenario.
\par\noindent
The net force exerted on the ``Dirichlet walls'' can be evaluated
using the Casimir force in any of the three vacua. It should be
noted that for the cases of the Hartle-Hawking and Unruuh vacua
the last term in equations (\ref{f2}) and (\ref{f3}),
respectively, should be removed. The reason is that in both vacua
the forces acting on both sides of each ``Dirichlet wall'' due to
thermal bath or radiation , respectively, are the same and thus
their total contribution to the net force is zero. Therefore the
net force which the ``Dirichlet walls'' experience is given as \begin{equation}
F_{net}=-\frac{\pi}{24L^2}+\frac{1}{2\Lambda}\end{equation} and setting it
equal to zero the distance $L$ between the ``Dirichlet walls''
receives the value \begin{equation}
L=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{12}}\Lambda^{1/2}\hspace{1ex}.\end{equation} It is clear
that the distance $L$ between the ``Dirichlet walls'' is
controlled by the value of the cosmological constant.

\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we have explicitly calculated in the Achucarro-Ortiz
black hole background the regularized stress tensor of a massless
scalar field satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions on
one-dimensional ``walls'' (``Dirichlet walls''). The regularized
stress tensor is separately treated in the Boulware,
Hartle-Hawking and Unruh vacua. In all these vacua, expressions
for the asymptotically detected energy, energy density and
pressure acting on the ``Dirichlet walls'' are obtained. The
values of the above mentioned quantities are all negative
exhibiting a violation of all energy conditions \cite{hawking4}.
This ``problem'' is somehow expected to take place in our scenario
since violations of some or all of the energy conditions appear as
soon as scalar fields couple to gravity \cite{matt1,matt2}. In the
Hartle-Hawking and Unruuh vacua, the corresponding Casimir force
is evaluated and proved, as expected, to be not always attractive:
it can be attractive, repulsive or zero according to the distance
$L$ between the ``Dirichlet walls''. In contradistinction to what
is known till now \cite{setare1,setare2,setare3,elias}, in the
Boulware vacuum, the Casimir force is also not always attractive.
Additionally, we have evaluated the net force exerted on the
``Dirichlet walls''. It is easily demonstrated by dictating the
stability of the ``Dirichlet walls'', i.e. zero net force, that
the distance between the one-dimensional ``walls'' is tuned by the
cosmological constant. This result can not stand as a proof but it
is an argument that there is a close relation between the
mechanism of stabilization for the Casimir-type system  and the
value of the cosmological constant.
\par\noindent
It would be very interesting for our scenario to be utilized in
higher dimensions and specifically in braneworlds. Indeed, there
are a number of recent works which they deal with the Casimir
effect in different models of braneworlds
\cite{garriga1,kanti,sergei1,maroto,sergei2,garriga2}. These
scenarios are more complicated than the one analyzed here, just to
mention that the branes are located in the bulk space
\cite{rs1,rs2}, not at points of the spacetime in which we live,
or the existence of the radion field which has to be stabilized
\cite{wise}. Apart from such technicalities which of course are
essential, there are ideas which these scenarios share with the
low-dimensional ones such as our last result concerning the
stabilization mechanism and the cosmological constant
\cite{tetradis}.
