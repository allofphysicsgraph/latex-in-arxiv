We prove that the quasiclassical tau-function of the multi-support solutions
to matrix models, proposed recently by Dijkgraaf and Vafa to be related to
the Cachazo-Intrilligator-Vafa
superpotentials of the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories,
satisfies the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations.
