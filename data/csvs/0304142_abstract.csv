Quantization procedure in the framework of general superfield quantization
method (GSQM), based on the Lagrangian [1] and Hamiltonian
[2] formulations for general superfield theory of fields,
for irreducible  gauge theories in Lagrangian formalism
is proposed.

Extension procedure for supermanifold ${\cal M}_{cl}$ of
superfields ${\cal A}^{\imath}(\theta)$, ghost number construction are
considered. Classical and $\hbar$-deformed
 generating (master) equations,
existence theorems for their solutions are formulated in
$T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{min}$, $T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{ext}$.
Analogous scheme is
realized for BV similar generating equations. Master equations versions
for GSQM and BV similar scheme are deformed in powers
of superfields ${\stackrel{\circ}{\Gamma}}{}^p(\theta)$ =
$\bigl({\stackrel{\circ}{\Phi}}{}^B(\theta)$,
${\stackrel{\circ}{\Phi}}{}^{\ast}_B(\theta)\bigr)$ into supermanifold
$T_{odd}(T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal M}_{ext})$. Arbitrariness in a choice of
solutions for these equations is described.

Investigation of formal Hamiltonian systems for  II class theories
[2] defined via corresponding   master equations solutions is
conducted. Gauge fixing for those theories is described by two ways.

Functional integral of superfunctions on $T_{odd}(T^{\ast}_{odd}{\cal
M}_{ext})$ is defined. Properties for  generating functionals of
Green's  superfunctions are studied.

$\theta$-component  quantization formulation, connection with BV method and
superfield quantization [3] are established. Quantization scheme realization
is demonstrated on  6 models.
