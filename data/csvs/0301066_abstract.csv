A generalized harmonic oscillator on noncommutative spaces is considered.
Dynamical symmetries  and physical 
equivalence of \nc \ systems with the same energy spectrum are investigated 
and discussed.
General solutions of three-dimensional \nc \ harmonic oscillator are  found 
and classified according to dynamical symmetries. 
We have found conditions under which three-dimensional \nc \ harmonic 
oscillator can be represented by ordinary, isotropic harmonic oscillator 
in effective  magnetic field.
