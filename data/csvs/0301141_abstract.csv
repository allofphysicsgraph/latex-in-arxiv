We investigate the weak-interaction emission of spin-$1/2$ fermions 
from decaying (and non-decaying) particles endowed with uniform circular 
motion. The decay of swirling protons and the neutrino-antineutrino emission 
from circularly moving electrons are analyzed in some detail. The 
relevance of our results to astrophysics is commented.
