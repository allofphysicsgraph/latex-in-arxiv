\item
The string coupling $g_s$ should go to zero
to suppress quantum effects, and the
total number of particles $\bar n$ should go to
infinity so that $|{ W}\rangle $ is well described by a classical wave.

\item $\frac{l_s}{a} \to 0 $ to ensure that
the massive closed strings decouple.

\item The gravitational radius associated with the total energy of
the wave, \begin{equation} r_G=(G_N  \epsilon)^{\frac{1}{23-p}},\end{equation} where
 should be comparable to the wavelength, $a$ (here $G_N$ is the
Newton constant in 26 dimensions). If we define the dimensionless parameter
%
\begin{equation}\label{212}\zeta =\frac{r_G}{a}=\frac{
(\,g_s^2 N^2
l_s^{48-2p}/a^{25-p}\,)^{\frac{1}{23-p}} }{a},\end{equation}
%
then in our set-up
%with stringy conventions
$\zeta $ plays the role of $\eta$  in (\ref{bhn})
That is, for small $\zeta$ the linearized approximation is valid
and a black hole will not be formed while for large $\zeta$
non-linear effects are important and lead to black hole
formation. So the critical value $\zeta^*$ is a number of order one.
