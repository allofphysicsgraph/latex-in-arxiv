\begin{abstract}
Smooth-throat wormholes are treated on as possessing quantum
fluctuation energy with scalar massive field as its source. Heat
kernel coefficients of the Laplace operator are calculated  in
background of the arbitrary-profile throat wormhole with the help
of the zeta-function approach. Two specific profile are
considered. Some arguments are given that the wormholes may exist.
It serves as a solution of semiclassical Einstein equations in the
range of specific values of length and certain radius of
wormhole's throat and constant of non-minimal connection.

\section{Introduction}\label{Intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Great interest towards the space-time of wormholes dates back
at least to 1916 \cite{Fla16}. Subsequent activity was initiated by
both classical works of Einstein and Rosen in 1935 \cite{EinRos35} in the
context of black hole space-time structure and the later series of
works by Wheeler in 1955 \cite{Whe55} with his excellent idea to
create everything from nothing. The more recent interest in the
topic of wormholes has been rekindled by the works of Morris and
Thorne \cite{MorTho88} and Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever
\cite{MorThoYur88} who made use of the concept of wormhole in scientific
discussion of ""time machine"". These authors constructed and
investigated a class of objects they referred to as ""traversable
wormholes"". Their work led to a flurry of activity in wormhole
physics \cite{VisserBook}.

It is well-known that the central problem of the traversable
wormholes connects with unavoidable violations of the null energy
condition. It means that the matter which should be a source of
this object has to possess some exotic properties. For this
reason the traversable wormhole can not be represented as a
self-consistent solution of Einstein equations with usual
classical matter as a source because usual matter is sure to
satisfy all energy conditions. One way out is to use quantum fields
in frameworks of semi-classical quantum gravity. The point is that
the vacuum average value of energy-momentum tensor of quantum
fluctuations may violate energy conditions. A self-consistent
wormholes in framework the semiclassical quantum gravity have been
studied in Ref. \cite{Sus92}. In our recent paper \cite{KhuSus02}
we have considered a possibility for self-consistent solution of
semi-classical Einstein equations for specific kind of wormhole --
short-throat flat-space wormhole. The model represents two
identical copies of Minkowski space with spherical regions excised
from each copy, and with boundaries of these regions to be
identified. The space-time of this model is flat everywhere except
a two-dimensional singular spherical surface. The vacuum average
of energy of quantum fluctuations of massive scalar field with
non-minimal connection serves as a source for this space-time. Due
to the fact that this space-time is flat everywhere a complete set
of wave modes of the massive scalar field can be constructed and
ground state energy can be calculated. In the paper we present a
calculation of full energy of quantum fluctuations rather then
energy density and use the Einstein's equations with quantum source only,
without classical contribution. We found that the energy of
fluctuations as a function of radius of throat $a$ may possess a
minimum  if the non-minimal connection constant $\xi > 0.123$.
Utilization of the Einstein equations at the minimum gives the stable configurations
of the wormhole. For instance, in the case of conformal
connection, $\xi = 1/6$, we found relation between the radius $a$
of wormhole and mass $m$ of the scalar field: $am \approx 0.16$.
The Einstein equations say that the wormhole has a radius of throat
$a \approx 0.0141 l_{Pl}$ and the mass of scalar field $m \approx
11.35m_{Pl}$. Therefore, this kind of wormhole, if it exists, may
possess sub-Planckian radius of throat and it may be created by a
massive scalar field with supper-Planckian mass. Obviously, the
validity of the results obtained are restricted by the model taken  --
short-throat flat-space wormhole.

The goal of this paper is to consider the wormholes with more real
geometry of throat and energy of quantum fluctuations of massive
scalar field as a source of this background. The main problem in
this case has rather mathematical character. Even for simple
profile of throat it becomes impossible to obtain a full set of
solutions of radial equation in order to find the energy density
of quantum fluctuations in close form. Nevertheless, it is
possible to make some predictions about the existence of the
wormholes by considering the heat kernel coefficients
\cite{KhuSus02}. In fact, the crucial point is the existence of
the negative minimum of the zero point energy. The sufficient
condition for the zero point energy to have negative minimum is
that the heat kernel coefficients $B_2$ and $B_3$ be positive
\cite{KhuSus02}. This gives a condition for parameters of model.
More precisely, if a background is described by a parameter $\tau$
with dimension of length and the domain where the space-time is
""mainly""\/ curved is defined by this parameter, then for small
size of curved domain, $\tau\to 0$, the zero point energy shows
the following behavior
\begin{displaymath}
E^{ren} \approx -\frac{B_2 \ln(\t32\pi^2}{32\pi^2},
\end{displaymath}
and in opposite limit $\tau\to \infty$ we have
\begin{displaymath}
E^{ren} \approx -\frac{B_3}{32\pi^2 m^2}.
\end{displaymath}

If both these conditions are satisfied one can expect that the
system will stay in minimum of energy which is characterized by
specific values of parameters of wormhole and constant of
non-minimal connection $\xi$. Next step is the
utilization of the Einstein's equations with energy-momentum
tensor of quantum fluctuations as a source. Integration over volume
the $t-t$ component of this equation gives an additional relation
between parameters of wormhole and zero point energy by using which
we obtain the size of wormhole and mass of scalar field in terms of
the Planck length and Planck mass correspondingly. At the
beginning we may expect \cite{KhuSus02} that the size of wormhole
and mass of field will be in the Planck scale. For this reason we
are interested only in finding of the domain of the wormhole's parameters
and constant non-minimal connection $\xi$ for different models of
the wormhole's profile.

The manifest expression for coefficient $B_2$ exists for arbitrary
background, but this is not the case for coefficient $B_3$. For
this reason we adopt here the zeta-regularization approach (see
Sec. \ref{ZeroPoint}), in frame of which it is possible to
calculate the heat kernel coefficients and zero point energy
itself. We pursue here another goal -- to evolve the zeta-function
approach for situations where it is impossible to find
the full set of solutions of radial equation in closed form.
We find a method to calculate the heat kernel coefficients in the
background of wormhole with arbitrary profile of throat by using the WKB
approach. Moreover, we obtain expressions for arbitrary heat
kernel coefficients and we reproduce them in manifest form up to
$B_3$ for arbitrary profile of wormhole's throat.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. \ref{ATraver}
we consider the geometry of wormhole with smooth throat. In Sec.
\ref{ZeroPoint} we discuss the method of zeta-function for
calculation of zero-point energy. The WKB approach for scalar
massive field is considered in Sec.\ref{WKB}. The heat kernel
coefficients are obtained in Sec.\ref{Heat}. We calculate them in
manifest form for arbitrary profile of throat. The specific
profiles of throat are investigated in Sec.\ref{Model1} and
\ref{Model2}. In Sec.\ref{Conc} we discuss the results obtained.
Appendix A contains some technical formulas which are rather
complicated to reproduce them in the text.

We use units $\hbar = c = G = 1$. The signature of the space-time,
the sign of the Riemann and Ricci tensors, are the same as in the
book by Hawking and Ellis \cite{HawEllBook}.

\section{A traversable wormhole with smooth throat}\label{ATraver}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The metric of space-time of wormhole which is under consideration
has the form below
\begin{equation}\label{Metric}
ds^2 = -dt^2 + d\rho^2 + r^2(\rho)( d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta
d\varphi^2).
\end{equation}
The radial variable $\rho$ changes from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. In
the paper we restrict ourself by wormholes with symmetric throat
which means that $r(-\rho) = r(+\rho)$. The radius $a$ of throat
is defined as follows $a=r(0)$. We suppose that far from the
wormhole's throat the space-time becomes Minkowskian, that is
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{\rho\to\pm\infty} \frac{r^2(\rho)}{\rho^2} = 1.
\end{displaymath}
The non-zero components of the Ricci tensor and scalar curvature
have the following form
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{R}^\rho_\rho &=& -\frac{2r''}{r}, \\
\mathcal{R}^\theta_\theta = \mathcal{R}^\varphi_\varphi &=& -\frac{-1+r'^2 + r^2}{r^2},\\
\mathcal{R} &=& -\frac{2(-1+r'^2 r^2}{r^2}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The energy-momentum tensor corresponding to this metric has
diagonal form from which we observe that the source of this metric
possesses the following energy density and pressure:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon &=& -\frac{-1 + r'^2 + 2rr''}{8\pi r^2},\allowdisplaybreaks \\
%-\fr {1}{8\pi}\left\{\fr {a^2}{(\rho^2 + a^2)^2} + \Lambda\right\}
p_\rho &=&\frac{-1 + r'^2}{8\pi r^2},\allowdisplaybreaks \\
%\fr {1}{8\pi}\left\{- \fr {a^2}{(\rho^2 +a^2)^2} + \Lambda\right\}
p_\theta &=& p_\varphi = \frac{r''}{8\pi r}.
%\fr {1}{8\pi}\left\{\fr {a^2}{(\rho^2 +a^2)^2} + \Lambda\right\}
\end{eqnarray*}

In the paper we obtain general formulas for space-time
(\ref{Metric}) with arbitrary symmetric function $r(\rho)$ obeying
above Minkowskian condition. Two specific kinds of throat's
profile will be considered. In the first model the profile of
throat has the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{First}
r(\rho) = \sqrt{\rho^2 + a^2},
\end{equation}
where $a$ is radius of throat which characterizes wormhole's size.
The embedding into the three dimensional Euclidean space of the
section of the space-time by surface $t=const, \theta = \pi/2$ is
plotted in Fig.\ref{worms}(I) for two different values of radius
of throat. In Euclidean space with cylindrical coordinates
$(r,\varphi,z)$ this surface may be found in parametric form from
relations: $r=r(\rho),z'(\rho) = \sqrt{1-r'^2}$. In this
background there is the only nonzero component of the Ricci tensor
which reads
\begin{displaymath}
{\cal R}^\rho_\rho = -"
