Based on local gauge invariance, four different kinds of 
fundamental interactions in Nature  are unified in a 
theory which has $SU(3)_c
\otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1) \otimes _s Gravitational~ Gauge~ Group$
gauge symmetry. In this approach, gravitational field, like 
electromagnetic field, intermediate gauge field and gluon
field, is represented by gauge potential. Four kinds of
fundamental interactions are formulated in the similar
manner, and therefore can be unified in a direct or
semi-direct product group. The model discussed in 
this paper can be regarded as extension of the 
standard model to gravitational interactions. 
The model discussed in this paper is a renormalizable
quantum model, so it can be used to study quantum effects 
of gravitational interactions.
