The twisting function describing nonstandard (super-Jordanian)
quantum deformation of $osp(1|2)$ is given  in explicite closed
form. The quantum coproducts and universal $R$-matrix are
presented. The non-uniqueness of twisting function as well as two
real forms of deformed $osp(1|2)$ superalgebras are considered.
One real quantum $osp(1|2)$ superalgebra is interpreted as
describing the $\kappa$-deformation of $D=1,\, N=1$ superconformal
algebra, which can be applied as symmetry algebra of $N=1$
superconformal mechanics.
