\item[{\bf P1}] The state space
 $W$ is a Hilbert space. To every physical
observable ${\cal O}$ there corresponds a Hermitian (self-adjoint) operator $\hat O$
acting in $W$.
\item[{\bf P2}] The observable ${\cal O}$ can take on only those values which
are eigenvalues of $\hat O$. The expectation value of the observable ${\cal O}$ in a
state $\psi$ is given by $\la {\hat O}\ra_\psi=(\psi,{\hat O}\psi)/(\psi,\psi)$, where
$(\psi,\phi)$ denotes the scalar product of $\psi,\phi\in W$.

\item[{\bf P3}] Hamilton's equations and the Heisenberg equations hold and
are identical (as operator equations) in $W$.
\"
2,"\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]  $W(p)$ is a Hilbert space with respect to the natural
Fock space inner product;
\item[(b)] the observables, in particular the position and momentum
operators~(\ref{2.15}), are Hermitian operators.
