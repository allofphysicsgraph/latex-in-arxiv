\begin{abstract}
We discuss the application of the method of characteristics to the 
renormalization-group equation for the perturbative QCD series within 
the electron-positron annihilation cross-section.  We demonstrate how
one such renormalization-group improvement of this series is equivalent
to a closed-form summation of the first four towers of 
renormalization-group accessible logarithms to all orders of 
perturbation theory.

The renormalization group (RG) has played a central role
in our understanding of quantum field theory [1-10] especially
since the discovery of asymptotic freedom [11-14].  The central
idea of the renormalization group is the insensitivity of physical
quantities to the mass scale $\mu^2$ introduced in the course of
regularizing and eliminating infinities within perturbative
calculations.  Explicit dependence of a perturbative series on $\mu^2$
is compensated by $\mu^2$ dependence in masses and coupling constants
characterising that series.  Indeed, the replacement of such quantities
by running quantities that are explicitly functions of $\mu^2$
constitutes what is generally denoted by ``RG-improvement'' of a
perturbative expression \cite{15}.  The numerical value of a calculation
to a given order of perturbation theory still depends upon the
numerical value of $\mu^2$, entailing the introduction of either prescriptions
(e.g., $m_b / 2 \leq \mu \leq 2m_b$ for semileptonic $b$-decays) or procedures
\cite{16,17} to obtain optimal values of $\mu^2$.

However, such substitutions do not in themselves take full advantage of
all information accessible from the renormalization-group equation
(RGE), which also determines portions of the perturbative series beyond
the order of perturbation theory to which calculations have been
explicitly performed.  Application of the RGE to one-loop expressions
has long been known to determine the leading logarithm contribution to
each subsequent order of perturbation theory.  The RGE can similarly be
used in conjunction with two-loop calculations to determine 
next-to-leading logarithm contributions to all subsequent orders in perturbation
theory --  indeed the application of the RGE to an $n^{th}$ loop
perturbative expression is sufficient to determine the contribution of
$n$ successively-subleading logarithms to all orders in the perturbative
expansion parameter.\footnote{The possibility that infrared effects
might alter this is addressed in ref. \cite{18}} 
Such RGE methods for obtaining and summing ``RG-accessible'' logarithms to 
all orders of perturbation theory have been applied to effective potentials
\cite{19} and actions \cite{20,
21}, QCD correlation functions \cite{22, 23}, QCD contributions to
decay rates \cite{22}, and even the high-energy behaviour of the $WW
\rightarrow ZZ$ cross-section \cite{22}, a process dominated by Higgs
boson exchanges. A related RG-summation of dimensionality poles
in the expansion of the bare coupling constant in terms of its
renormalized analog has been developed in ref. \cite{24} and (for
thermal field theory) in ref. \cite{25}.

The point we wish to emphasize is that the summation of higher order
logarithmic contributions is quite distinct (and a substantial
improvement over) what is usually
understood to be RG-improvement, the incorporation of running masses and
coupling constants into perturbative expressions taken to a given order.
Indeed, such inclusion of all RG-accessible logarithms within perturbative 
series is forcefully advocated in ref. \cite{26}.  Series which
incorporate summation of RG-accessible logarithmic
contributions to all orders of perturbation theory have been seen to
exhibit much less dependence on $\mu^2$ than series which utilize
running masses and coupling constants to a fixed calculational order
\cite{22, 23}.  This latter approach, however, devolves from the method
of characteristics \cite{27}, a standard approach to first-order partial
differential equations such as the RGE \cite{28}.  We demonstrate below how this
same method of characteristics can be extended to obtain summations of
leading and three successively-subleading towers of logarithms to all
orders of the perturbative  QCD series for the electron-positron
annihilation cross-section.

The total cross-section for $e^+ e^-$-annihilation, $R(s) \equiv \sigma
(e^+ e^- \rightarrow {\rm hadrons}) /$ $\sigma (e^+ e^- \rightarrow \mu^+
\mu^-)$ can be extracted from the imaginary part of the QCD 
vector-current correlation function \cite{29}, a perturbative expression 
that necessarily depends upon a renormalization mass scale $\mu$:
\begin{equation}%1
R(s) = 3 \sum_f Q_f^2 S \left[ x(\mu^2), \log (\mu^2 / s) \right].
\end{equation}
The expansion parameter $x(\mu^2) \equiv \alpha_s (\mu^2) / \pi$ is
proportional to the running QCD coupling constant, and renormalization
mass scale $\mu$ is a by-product of the regularization procedure for
indentifying and excising infinities from the underlying correlation
function, as discussed above.  Since $R(s)$ cannot depend on this
unphysical scale parameter, it follows that
\begin{equation}%2
\mu^2 \frac{d R(s)}{d\mu^2} = 0 = \left( \mu^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial
\mu^2} + \beta (x) \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) R(s)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}%3
\beta(x(\mu^2)) \equiv \mu^2 \frac{dx(\mu^2)}{d\mu^2}
\end{equation}
with an appropriately chosen boundary condition for (3) [{\it e.g.}
$x(\Lambda^2) = \infty$ or $x (M_z^2) = 0.118 / \pi$].  Perturbative
series expansions of $S[x(\mu^2), \log \left( \frac{\mu^2}{s}\right)]$ and
$\beta(x)$ are seen to take the form



\setcounter{equation}{0}

\begin{equation}%4a
S[x,L] = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} T_{n,m} x^n L^m
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}%4b
\beta(x) = -x^2 \sum_{k=0}^\infty \beta_k x^k
\end{equation}
where $x = x(\mu^2)$ and $L \equiv \log (\mu^2/s)$.  Generally $\beta(x)$ is determined by relating 
the bare coupling to the renormalized coupling \cite{7,9,24}, although it
can also be extracted directly from eq. (2) \cite{20,21,30}.  Indeed, explicit
Feynman diagrammatic calculations to four-loop order have determined
$\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$ \cite{13, 14, 31} as well as $T_{1,0},
T_{2,1}, T_{2,0}, T_{3,2}, T_{3,1}$ and $T_{3,0}$ \cite{29}, and these
results (as tabulated in Table I of ref. [23]) are manifestly consistent with eq.
(2).

However, it is possible to utilize eq. (2) to extract higher-order
coefficients within $S[x,L]$ than those tabulated in Table 1.  It is
easily seen \cite{23} that $T_{1,0}$ and $\beta_0$ determine {\it all}
leading logarithm coefficients $T_{n, n-1}$ for $n > 1$;  similarly
additional knowledge of $T_{2,0}$ and $\beta_1$ is sufficient to
determine all next-to-leading logarithm coefficients $T_{n, n-2}$ for $n
> 2$;  knowledge of $T_{3,0}$ and $\beta_2$ permits determination of
$T_{n, n-3}$ for $n > 3$, and so forth. In ref. [23], the double
summation in eq. (4a) is reorganised into the form


\setcounter{equation}{4}


\begin{equation}%5
S[x,L] = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty x^n S_n (xL)
\end{equation}
where the functions
\begin{equation}%6
S_n (u) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty T_{n+k, k} u^k
\end{equation}
are completely determined by knowledge of the ``RG-accessible''
coefficients $T_{n+k, k}$.  One can show that eq. (2) gives rise to a
nested set of first order differential equations for the functions $S_n
(u)$:
\begin{equation}%7
\frac{dS_k}{du} - \frac{k\beta_0}{1-\beta_0 u} S_k = \frac{(1-
\delta_{k,1})}{1-\beta_0 u} \sum_{\ell = 1}^{k-1} \beta_\ell \left( u
\frac{d}{du} + k - \ell \right) S_{k-\ell} (u), \; \; S_n(0)=T_{n,0}.
\end{equation}
These equations are derived and sequentially solved in ref. [23]. When
one applies this ``RG-summation'' to the series (5) within $R(s)$, the
dependence of $R(s)$ on $\mu^2$ is substantially reduced \cite{22,23}.
This is not surprising, as the exact result for $R(s)$ is necessarily
independent of $\mu^2$ [the RGE is just a statement of this independence], 
and the inclusion of higher-order logarithm contributions to $R(s)$ via 
(5) is expected to approximate the exact result more closely than truncation 
of eq. (4) to a given order.

As discussed above, the method of characteristics [27,28] provides a
complementary procedure for obtaining information from the
renormalization group equation (2).  To illustrate this method, consider
the first-order partial differential equation
\begin{equation}%8
\left[ f(x,y) \frac{\partial}{\partial x} + g (x,y)
\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \right] A(x,y) = 0
\end{equation}
where $f$ and $g$ are given functions, and where $A(x,y)$ may be
indentified as some field-theoretical amplitude characterised by
quantities ({\it e.g}, coupling constants) $x$ and $y$.  If $A_0 (x,y)$ is a solution to eq.
(8), then so is $A_0 \left( \bar{x} (t), \bar{y} (t) \right)$, provided
that
\begin{equation}%9
\frac{d\bar{x}}{dt} = f \left( \bar{x} (t), \bar{y}(t) \right), \; \;
\frac{d\bar{y}}{dt} = g \left( \bar{x}(t), \bar{y}(t) \right)
\end{equation}
with initial conditions $\bar{x}(0) = x, \; \; \bar{y} (0) = y$.  One
then sees from eqs. (9) that
\begin{equation}%10
0 = \left[ f(\bar{x}, \bar{y}) \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{x}} + g
(\bar{x}, \bar{y}) \frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{y}} \right] A_0
(\bar{x}, \bar{y}) = \frac{d}{dt} A_0 \left( \bar{x}(t), \bar{y}(t)
\right)
\end{equation}
The initial conditions ensure that $A_0 \left( \bar{x}(t), \bar{y}(t)
\right)$ is a solution of eq. (8) when $t = 0$.  Since eq. (10) implies
that $A_0 \left( \bar{x}(t), \bar{y}(t)
\right)$ is independent of $t$, $A_0 \left( \bar{x}(t), \bar{y}(t)
\right)$ is necessarily a solution to eq. (8) for all values of $t$.  
Eqs. (9) and (10) provide the justification for replacing the variables $x$ and
$y$ with their corresponding characteristic functions $\bar{x}, \bar{y}$ in the 
amplitude $A(x,y)$.

For the RGE (2), as applied to the field theoretical series $S[x, \log
(\mu^2 / s)]$, the role of $f$ and $g$ as dependent variables is assumed
by $\mu^2$ and $\beta$, in which case correspondence to eqs. (9) requires
running values for these functions
\begin{equation}%11
\frac{d\bar{\mu}^2 (t)}{dt} = \bar{\mu}^2 (t),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}%12
\frac{d\bar{x} (t)}{dt} = \beta (\bar{x} (t)).
\end{equation}
The usual prescription for RG improvement is to identify $t$ with
$\log(\mu^2)$ [{\it i.e.}, $\bar{\mu}^2 = e^t = \mu^2$ via eq. (11)], in which
case eq. (12) becomes eq. (3).  Indeed, this construction provides the
justification for having the coupling constant $x$ run with $\mu^2$
within the perturbative series (4a) \cite{27}.

However, it is entirely valid to let $t$ be arbitrarily chosen in eqs.
(11) and (12), up to initial conditions $\bar{\mu}^2 (0) = \mu^2$,
$\bar{x}(0) = x(\mu^2)$ that establish contact with a known solution to
eq. (2).  Thus the ``running coupling'' $x(\mu^2)$ may be employed to
serve as an initial condition for the characteristic function $\bar{x}
(t)$.\footnote{The dimensional regularization equation relating the bare
$(g_B)$ and renormalized $(g)$ coupling constants is $g_B = \mu^\epsilon
\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{k=\ell}^\infty a_{k,\ell} g^{2k+1}/\epsilon^\ell$
\cite{7,9}. Since $g_B$ is a bare parameter independent of $\mu$, the renormalized
coupling-constant $g$ is necessarily a $\mu$-dependent quantity, {\it i.e.}, 
a function of $\mu$.}

In order to keep track of the order of perturbation theory to which we
are working, we follow the approach of ref. [32] by introducing an
expansion parameter $\hbar$ such that


\setcounter{equation}{0}

\begin{equation}%13a
t \longrightarrow t/\hbar
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}%13b
\bar{x} \longrightarrow \bar{x}\hbar
\end{equation}
so that the characteristic equations (9) become


\setcounter{equation}{13}

\begin{equation}%14
\hbar \frac{d\bar{\mu}^2 (t)}{dt} = \bar{\mu}^2 (t)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}%15
\hbar^2 \frac{d\bar{x} (t)}{dt} = - \bar{x}^2 \hbar^2 \sum_{n=0}^\infty \bar{x}^n \hbar^n \beta_n
\end{equation}
and the series expansion (4a) becomes
\begin{equation}%16
S[\bar{x}, \bar{L}] = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} T_{n,m} \hbar^n \bar{x}^n \bar{L}^m
\end{equation}
$[\bar{L} \equiv \log \left( \bar{\mu}^2 (t) / s \right)]$.  From eq. (14) and 
the $\bar{\mu}(0) = \mu$ initial condition, we see that 
\begin{equation}%17
\bar{\mu}^2 (t) = \mu^2 e^{t/\hbar}.
\end{equation}
We now express $\bar{x} (t)$ as a perturbative expansion
\begin{equation}%18
\bar{x}(t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \bar{x}_n (t) \hbar^n
\end{equation}
with $\bar{x}_0 (0) = x(\mu^2)$ and $\bar{x}_n (0) = 0$ for $n > 0$.  Upon subsituting eq. (18)
into eq. (15), we obtain a nested set of linear first-order differential equations for the 
variables $\bar{x}_n (t)$ when $n > 0$:
\begin{equation}%19
\frac{d\bar{x}_0}{dt} = - \beta_0 \bar{x}_0^2, \; \; \; \bar{x}_0 (0) =
x(\mu^2),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}%20
\frac{d\bar{x}_1}{dt} + \left( 2\beta_0 \bar{x}_0 (t) \right) \bar{x}_1
= - \beta_1 \bar{x}_0^3 (t), \; \; \; \bar{x}_1 (0) = 0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}%21
\frac{d\bar{x}_2}{dt} + \left( 2\beta_0 \bar{x}_0 (t) \right) \bar{x}_2
= - \beta_2 \bar{x}_0^4 (t) - 3\beta_1 \bar{x}_0^2 (t) \bar{x}_1 (t) -
\beta_0 \bar{x}_1^2 (t), \; \; \; \bar{x}_2 (0) = 0,
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}%22
\frac{d\bar{x}_3}{dt} + \left( 2\beta_0 \bar{x}_0 (t) \right) \bar{x}_3
= & - & \beta_3 \bar{x}_0^5 (t) - 4\beta_2 \bar{x}_0^3 (t) \bar{x}_1
(t)\nonumber\\
& - & 3\beta_1 \left(\bar{x}_0^2 (t) \bar{x}_2 (t) + \bar{x}_0 (t)
\bar{x}_1^2 (t) \right)\nonumber\\
& - & 2\beta_0 \bar{x}_1 (t) \bar{x}_2 (t), \; \; \; \bar{x}_3 (0) = 0.
\end{eqnarray}
The solution to eq. (19) is
\begin{equation}%23
\bar{x}_0 (t) = \frac{x(\mu^2)}{1 + \beta_0 x (\mu^2)t}.
\end{equation}
If we substitute eq. (23) into eq. (20), we find the solution to eq.
(20) to be
\begin{equation}%24
\bar{x}_1 (t) = -\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_0} \frac{x^2(\mu^2) \log (1 +
\beta_0 x (\mu^2) t)}{(1 + \beta_0 x(\mu^2) t)^2}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, subsitution of eq. (23) and (24) into eq. (21) leads to a
solution for $\bar{x}_2 (t)$
\begin{eqnarray}%25
\bar{x}_2 (t) & = & \frac{x^3(\mu^2)}{(1 + \beta_0 x (\mu^2) t)^3}
\left[ \left( \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} - \frac{\beta_2}{\beta_0}
\right) \beta_0 x(\mu^2) t - \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} \log (1+\beta_0
x (\mu^2) t)\right. \nonumber\\
& + & \left. \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} \log^2 (1 + \beta_0 x (\mu^2)
t) \right],
\end{eqnarray}
and substitution of eqs. (23), (24) and (25) into eq. (22) leads to a
solution of $\bar{x}_3 (t)$:
\begin{eqnarray}%26
\bar{x}_3 (t) & = & \frac{x^4(\mu^2)}{(1 + \beta_0 x(\mu^2) t)^4} \left[
\left( - \frac{\beta_1^3}{2\beta_0^3} + \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2}{\beta_0^2} -
\frac{\beta_3}{2\beta_0} \right) (1 + \beta_0 x(\mu^2) t)^2 \right.\nonumber\\
& + & \left( \frac{\beta_1^3}{\beta_0^3} - \frac{\beta_1
\beta_2}{\beta_0^2}\right) (1 + \beta_0 x(\mu^2) t) \left( 1 - 2\log (1
+ \beta_0 x(\mu^2) t) \right)\nonumber\\
& + & \left( -\frac{\beta_1^3}{2\beta_0^3} + \frac{\beta_3}{2\beta_0}
\right) + \left( \frac{2\beta_1^3}{\beta_0^3} - \frac{3\beta_1
\beta_2}{\beta_0^2} \right) \log \left( 1 + \beta_0 x(\mu^2)
t\right)\nonumber\\
& + & \left. \frac{5\beta_1^3}{2\beta_0^3} \log^2 \left( 1 + \beta_0 x(\mu^2)
t\right) - \frac{\beta_1^3}{\beta_0^3} \log^3 \left( 1 + \beta_0
x(\mu^2) t\right) \right].
\end{eqnarray}
(Eqs. (23), (24) and (25) also appear in refs. [21,32].)  Eqs. (23) -
(26) provide an expansion (18) of the solution to (15) that is distinct
from the usual perturbative expansion.

If we substitute the series (18) into the expansion (16) for
$S[\bar{x},\bar{L}]$ we find the following solution to the renormalization
group equation (2):
\begin{eqnarray}%27
S[\bar{x}, \bar{L}] & = & 1 + \hbar [T_{1,0} \bar{x}_0 (t)]\nonumber\\
& + & \hbar^2 \left[  T_{1,0} \bar{x}_1 (t) + (T_{2,0} + T_{2,1}
\bar{L}) \bar{x}_0^2 (t)]\right]\nonumber\\
& + & \hbar^3 \left[ T_{1,0} \bar{x}_2 (t) + \left( T_{2,0} + T_{2,1}
\bar{L}\right) \left( 2\bar{x}_0 (t)
\bar{x}_1(t)\right)\right.\nonumber\\
& & + \left. \left( T_{3,0} +T_{3,1} \bar{L} + T_{3,2} \bar{L}^2 \right)
\bar{x}_0^3 (t)\right]\nonumber\\
& + & \hbar^4 \left[ T_{1,0} \bar{x}_3 (t) + (T_{2,0} + T_{2,1}
\bar{L})(\bar{x}_1^2 (t) + 2\bar{x}_0 (t) \bar{x}_2
(t))\right.\nonumber\\
& & + \left( T_{3,0} + T_{3,1} \bar{L} + T_{3,2} \bar{L}^2 \right)
\left( 3\bar{x}_0^2(t) \bar{x}_1 (t) \right)\nonumber\\
& & + \left. \left( T_{4,0} + T_{4,1} \bar{L} + T_{4,2} \bar{L}^2 + T_{4,3}
\bar{L}^3 \right) \bar{x}_0^4 (t)\right]\nonumber\\
& + & ...
\end{eqnarray} 
Now, if $t = 0$, we find from eq. (17) that $\bar{\mu}^2 = \mu^2$, $\bar{L}
= \log(\mu^2/s) = L$.  Since $\bar{x}_0 (0) = x(\mu^2)$ and $\bar{x}_k
(0) = 0$ for $k \geq 1$, we see that eq. (27) recovers the original
expansion (4a) when $\hbar = 1$.

It $t$ is a non-zero constant, the solution (27) provides a means for
obtaining all coefficients $T_{n,m}$ with $m \neq 0$ in terms of
coefficients $T_{k,0}$.  To see this, let $t = \hbar \log k$, in which
case we see from eq. (17) that $\bar{\mu}^2 = k\mu^2$, $\bar{L} = \log
(k\mu^2/s) = L + \log k$.  If we substitute $t = \hbar \log k$ into eqs.
(23) - (26) and note that
\begin{eqnarray}%28
\log \left( 1 + \hbar \beta_0 x(\mu^2) t\right) & = & \hbar \beta_0
x(\mu^2)\log k\nonumber\\
& - & \frac{\hbar^2}{2} \beta_0^2 x^2 (\mu^2) \log^2 k\nonumber\\
& + & \frac{\hbar^3}{3} \beta_0^3 x^3 (\mu^2) \log^3 k + ... \; ,
\end{eqnarray}
we find upon further substitution into eq. (27) that
\begin{eqnarray}%29
S[\bar{x}, \bar{L}]|_{t = \hbar \log k} & = & 1 + \hbar x(\mu^2)
T_{1,0}\nonumber\\
& + & \hbar^2 x^2 (\mu^2) \left[ (T_{2,0} - \beta_0 T_{1,0} \log k) +
T_{2,1} \log (k\mu^2/s)\right]\nonumber\\
& + & \hbar^3 x^3(\mu^2) \left\{ \left[ T_{3,0} - (2 T_{2,0} \beta_0 +
T_{1,0} \beta_1) \log k + T_{1,0} \beta_0^2 \log^2 k \right]
\right.\nonumber\\
&& + \left. \left[ T_{3,1} - 2\beta_0 T_{2,1} \log k \right] \log
(k\mu^2/s) + T_{3,2} \log^2 (k\mu^2/s) \right\}\nonumber\\
& + & \hbar^4 x^4 (\mu^2) \left\{ \left[ T_{4,0} - \left( 3\beta_0 T_{3,0} +
2\beta_1 T_{2,0} + \beta_2 T_{1,0} \right) \log k \right.
\right. \nonumber\\
&& + \left. \left(3\beta_0^2 T_{2,0} + \frac{5}{2} \beta_0 \beta_1
T_{1,0} \right) \log^2 k - \beta_0^3 T_{1,0} \log^3 k \right]\nonumber\\
&& + \left[ T_{4,1} - (3 \beta_0 T_{3,1} + 2\beta_1 T_{2,1} ) \log k + 3
\beta_0^2 T_{2,1} \log^2 k \right] \log (k\mu^2/s)\nonumber\\
&& + \left. \left[ T_{4,2} - 3\beta_0 T_{3,2} \log k \right] \log^2
(k\mu^2/s) + T_{4,3} \log^3 (k\mu^2/s) \right\}\nonumber\\
&& + {\cal{O}} \left( \hbar^5 x^5 (\mu^2) \right).
\end{eqnarray}
Now if we rewrite the original series expansion (4a) with $L \equiv \log
(\mu^2/s) = \log (k\mu^2/s) - \log k$, we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}%30
S[x,L] & = & 1 + x(\mu^2) T_{1,0}\nonumber\\
& + & x^2 (\mu^2) \left[ (T_{2,0} - T_{2,1} \log k ) + T_{2,1} \log

& + & x^3 (\mu^2) \left[ (T_{3,0} - T_{3,1} \log k + T_{3,2} \log^2 k)
\right. \nonumber\\
&& + (T_{3,1} - 2T_{3,2} \log k) \log (k\mu^2 / s) \nonumber\\
&& \left. + T_{3,2} \log^2 (k\mu^2/s)\right]\nonumber\\
& + & x^4 (\mu^2) \left[ (T_{4,0} - T_{4,1} \log k +  T_{4,2} \log^2 k -
T_{4,3} \log^3 k) \right.\nonumber\\
&& + (T_{4,1} - 2 T_{4,2} \log k + 3 T_{4,3} \log^2 k) \log

&& \left. + (T_{4,2} - 3 T_{4,3} \log k) \log^2 (k\mu^2/s) + T_{4,3} \log^3

When $\hbar = 1$, eqs. (29) and (30) must be equal, since the solution (27)
to the renormalization-group equation (2) has been constructed...

\begin{itemize}
\item[1)]...to coincide with eq. (30) at $t = 0$, 
\item[2)]...to be independent of the choice for $t$ via the method of 
characteristics [eq. (10)], and
\item[3)]...to be given by eq. (29) when $t = \hbar \log k$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Direct comparison of eqs. (29) and (30) when $\hbar = 1$ shows
that 
\begin{eqnarray}%31
T_{2,1} & = & \beta_0 T_{1,0},\nonumber\\
T_{3,1} & = & 2 T_{2,0} \beta_0 + \beta_1 T_{1,0},\nonumber\\
T_{3,2} & = & \beta_0^2 T_{1,0},\nonumber\\
T_{4,1} & = & 3\beta_0 T_{3,0} + 2\beta_1 T_{2,0} + \beta_2
T_{1,0},\nonumber\\
T_{4,2} & = & 3\beta_0^2 T_{2,0} + \frac{5}{2} \beta_0 \beta_1
T_{1,0},\nonumber\\
T_{4,3} & = & \beta_0^3  T_{1,0},
\end{eqnarray}
relations that can also be obtained  \cite{22} by direct substitution of
the series (4a) into the renormalization-group equation (2).  Thus, the
method of characteristics is seen to determine all logarithmic
coefficients to the order of perturbation theory considered.

However, a more powerful application of the solution (27) occurs by
setting $t = \hbar \log (s/\mu^2)$, ensuring via eq. (17) that
$\bar{\mu}^2 = s$, that $\bar{L} = 0$, and that factors of $1 + \hbar
\beta_0 x(\mu^2) t$ in eqs. (23) - (26) become $1 - \beta_0 x(\mu^2)
\log (\mu^2/s) \equiv w$ in the $\hbar \rightarrow 1$ limit.  In this
limit, eq. (27) generates the following series:
\begin{eqnarray}%32
S[\bar{x}, \bar{L}] & = & 1 + x(\mu^2) \frac{T_{1,0}}{w} +  x^2 (\mu^2) \left[ T_{2,0} - \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_0} T_{1,0} \log
w \right] w^{-2}\nonumber\\
& + & x^3 (\mu^2) \left[ T_{3,0} - 2T_{2,0} \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_0} \log
w  +  \left( \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} - \frac{\beta_2}{\beta_0}
\right) (w-1) - \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} \log w +
\frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} \log^2 w \right]w^{-3}\nonumber\\
& + & x^4 (\mu^2) \left[ \left( - \frac{\beta_1^3}{2\beta_0^3} + \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2}{\beta_0^2} - \frac{\beta_3}{2\beta_0} \right) w^2
 + \left( \frac{\beta_1^3}{\beta_0^3} - \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2}{\beta_0^2} + 2T_{2,0} \left( \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} - \frac{\beta_2}{\beta_0} \right) \right) \right. w\nonumber\\
& + & \left( -\frac{2\beta_1^3}{\beta_0^3} + \frac{2\beta_1 \beta_2}{\beta_0^2} \right) w \log w + \left( -\frac{\beta_1^3}{2\beta_0^3} + \frac{\beta_3}{2\beta_0} 
-  2T_{2,0} \left( \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} -
\frac{\beta_2}{\beta_0}\right) + T_{4,0} \right) \nonumber\\
& + & \left( \frac{2\beta_1^3}{\beta_0^3} - \frac{3\beta_1 \beta_2}{\beta_0^2} 
-  2T_{2,0} \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2} - 3T_{3,0} \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_0} \right) \log w \nonumber\\
& + & \left( \frac{5\beta_1^3}{2\beta_0^3} + 3T_{2,0} \frac{\beta_1^2}{\beta_0^2}\right) \log^2 w\nonumber\\
& - & \left. \frac{\beta_1^3}{\beta_0^3} \log^3 w \right] w^{-4} + \; ... 
\end{eqnarray}
This series explicitly reproduces the series (5) obtained via the
successive solutions to the differential equations (7).  The coefficient
functions $S_1 (xL)$, $S_2(xL)$, $S_3(xL)$ and $S_4(xL)$, as calculated
in ref. [23], are reproduced in eq. (32), demonstrating how the 
method-of-characteristics approach to the renormalization group equation can
recover the results obtained via summation of leading, next-to-leading,
and successively subleading logarithm factors to {\it all} orders of
perturbation theory.  Such results as eq. (32) represent the optimal
possible RG-improvement of the original perturbative series (4a),
insofar as they incorporate all RG-accessible coefficients of logarithms
occurring within that series.

As a final note, the ambiguity in the choice of $k$ such that $t = \hbar
\log k$ [thereby leading to the series of eq. (29)] is equivalent to the
ambiguity noted in ref. [25].  In \cite{25}, this ambiguity was viewed
as a consequence of shifting the initial condition of eq. (7) to the
equation (6) defining $S_n (u)$;  by replacing $\log (\mu^2 / s)$ with
$\log (k \mu^2 / s) - \log (k)$ in the series (4a), that series becomes
\begin{equation}%33
S[x,L] = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} T_{n, m}^\prime x^n (L^\prime)^m
\end{equation}
where $L^\prime \equiv \log (k \mu^2 / s)$ and where $T_{1,0}^\prime = T_{1,0} = 1$, $T_{2,1}^\prime = T_{2,1},
T_{2,0}^\prime = T_{2,0} - T_{2,1} \log (k)$, etc.  The initial condition in
eq. (7) is now replaced by $S_n (0) = T_{n,0}^\prime$.  Of course, when one
sums to all orders in perturbation theory, the dependence on $k$ within
eq. (29) will drop out.
