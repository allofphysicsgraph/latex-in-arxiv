\item[i)] For a critical value of the electric gradient, 
we find an instability towards producing
macroscopic strings at no cost of energy: for that value, the
tensive energy of an open string, which goes like its length square,
is overwhelmed by the energy gained by stretching the string in
the quadratic potential. The string then grows arbitrarily until it
reaches the condensator that created the quadrupolar
field in the first place and discharges it. This 
critical {\it electric gradient}
is a non-relativistic analogue of the critical {\it electric field strength}
in ordinary Born-Infeld electrodynamics. A simple
elastic dipole model suffices to capture it.

\item[ii)] In the absence of a magnetic field, the dynamical instability
towards producing macroscopic strings is shadowed by the 
kinetic instability of charged particles  in a quadrupolar electrostatic 
potential. One way to cure the latter is to 
switch on a constant magnetic field in the unstable directions,
thereby confining the string into Larmor orbits. This is the
familiar Penning trap configuration used in ion trapping studies. 
We show that the critical gradient instability is impervious to this change.

\item[iii)] Another way to achieve confinement of charges in a quadrupolar
electric field is to modulate the electric field at a resonant frequency
with the proper modes of the electrostatic configuration: this is known as 
the Paul trap or rf (radiofrequency trap). We show that it manages equally
well to confine charged open strings. We further compute the effect
of a non-resonant adiabatic variation of the electric field.

\item[iv)] We compute the one-loop partition function of open bosonic
strings in a static quadrupolar electric field, 
and find that it coincides with the overlap of boundary states
in the closed string channel. This gives a new example of open-closed duality
in the non-conformal regime, beyond the one found in \cite{Bergman:2002hv}. 
We further discuss the spectrum
of the Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz string in this background, and find that a
new non-local interaction on the worldsheet is needed for 
worldsheet supersymmetry,
analogous to the one occurring in background independent string field
theory \cite{Kutasov:2000aq}. 

\item[v)] We consider the propagation of open strings in a
 time-dependent quadrupolar electric potential. As usual for 
plane wave background there is no production of strings at
zero coupling \cite{Aichelburg}, however strings do get excited as they cross
the electromagnetic wave. We compute the mode production in 
Born's approximation, and find as in \cite{hs} that wave profiles
with a delta function singularity transfer an infinite amount of
energy into the string. For the particular case $h_0(x^+)=
h_1(x^+ + p^+\pi)$, the Bogolioubov matrix may be calculated exactly,
despite the peculiar fact that the initial value problem
does not have a unique solution any longer. 
We also consider adiabatic and sudden
approximations.

1,"\begin{enumerate}
\item[1)] $\Phi_a=(A_a)_i (x^+) x^i$ is linear 
in $x^i$,
yet an arbitrary function of $x^+$: this corresponds to an electric
field $F_a=(F_a)_i(x^+) dx^i dx^+$ uniform in the transverse coordinates. The
equation  \eqref{bcilc} becomes a first order equation with source,
\be
\partial_\sigma X^i + B_{ij}
\partial_\tau X^j + p^+ (F_a)_i (x^+) = 0   \qquad\mbox{at} ~~
\sigma=\sigma_a\ .\quad \label{bclin}
\ee
Conformal invariance is therefore unbroken, and the field $X^i$ can
be computed easily by linear response. 
For $B=0$ this case is T-dual to a configuration of two D0-branes 
following null trajectories
$Y^i_a(x^+)$ where $dY^i_a/dx^+ = - A^i_a (x^+)$. Since this case
has been considered recently in \cite{Bachas}, 
we will not discuss it any further.

\item[2)]  $\Phi_a=(h_a)_{ij} (x^+) x^i x^j/2$   is quadratic  
in $x^i$, and arbitrary function of $x^+$: this corresponds to an electric
field $F_a=(h_a)_{ij}(x^+) x^i dx^j dx^+$ which now has a constant 
gradient in the transverse coordinates $x^i$. The
equation \eqref{bcilc} is still linear but includes a mass contribution,
in general time-dependent:
\be
\partial_\sigma X^i + p^+ (h_a)_{ij} (x^+) X^j + \frac12 B_{ij} \partial_\tau X^j
= 0   \qquad\mbox{at} ~~
\sigma=\sigma_a\ .\quad \label{bcquad}
\ee
Conformal invariance is now genuinely broken. This will be the case
of most interest in this paper, where we will show that the system
exhibits an interesting phase transition at a critical value of the
gradients $(h_a)_{ij}$.

\item[3)] Clearly, the two cases above can occur simultaneously,
for  $\Phi_a=(A_a)_i (x^+) x^i + (h_a)_{ij} (x^+) x^i x^j/2$. This amounts
to varying in time the location of the saddle point 
of the quadratic field, $x^i_{sad} = - (h^{-1})^{ij} A_j$, and again
could be computed by linear response from \eqref{bcquad}.

2,"\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)] {\it Penning trap:}
A well known scheme used in atomic physics to trap ions is to
add a constant magnetical field to confine the unstable directions
of the electrostatic potential.
The simplest example involves 3 dimensions, with a cylindrically 
symmetric quadrupole potential $V(x)=-\frac{e}{2} (x^2 + y^2 - 2 z^2)$,
and uses a constant magnetic field along $z$ to confine ions in the
$(x,y)$ plane. The equation of motion
\be
\begin{pmatrix} \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \\ \ddot{z} \end{pmatrix}
+ 2b  \begin{pmatrix} -\dot{y} \\ \dot{x} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
- e \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ -2z \end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\ee
leads to the dispersion relation
\be
(\om^2-2 \om b+e)
(\om^2+2 \om b+e)
(2e-\om^2)=0 
\ee
where the 3 terms correspond to the left and right polarizations in 
the $(x,y)$ plane and the $z$ direction, respectively. The motion
is stable iff all roots are real, i.e. $b^2>e$ and $e>0$. Hence only
positively charged (say) particles are trapped, and only if the magnetic field
is sufficiently strong.

\item[b)] {\it Paul trap:}
Charged particles can also be trapped with a quadrupolar field
alone, if it is modulated at a particular frequency,
$\Phi(x^+)=(e + f \sin(\omega \tau)(x^2-y^2)/2$, (parametrically)
resonant with the
proper mode of the quadrupolar field: this is known in atomic physics 
as the Paul, or rf (radiofrequency) trap. In mathematical terms, the
equation describing motion along the $x$ direction (say) is the
Mathieu equation,
\be
\ddot{x} + \left[ e + f \sin(\omega \tau) \right] x = 0
\ee
Its  stability diagram, discussed in \cite{vdpol}, 
is qualitatively the same as for a rectangular 
modulation, which can be computed much more easily and is shown
on Figure \ref{stability}. One sees that for $e<0$, there is a small
range of $f$ where the motion is still stable. We will return to this
point in Section 3.4.

\item[c)] {\it Quadrupolar trap}: Finally, 
while a static quadrupolar electric field 
alone cannot trap neutral particles, it can trap polarizable molecules
with negative polarizability: the potential energy of an induced
electric dipole $\mu_i=\alpha E_i$ is $W=-\alpha E^2$; if $\alpha$
is negative, this is minimal at the center of the quadrupole, where
$E_i$ vanishes \cite{wing}. While the ground state of a molecule has usually positive
polarizability, excited states if degenerate at $E=0$ can have negative 
$\alpha$: the Stark energy shift due to the electric field is given 
by first order degenerate perturbation theory, and is negative for
part of the multiplet. We will not pursue this case here.

5,"\begin{enumerate}
\item[$\beta$)] {\it Aligned:} we assume $h_0$ and $h_1$ to commute. After
diagonalization, and due to the tracelessness constraint, we can write
\be
h_0 = e \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\ & -1 \end{pmatrix}\ ,\quad
h_1 = e' \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\ & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\ee 
The secular equation factorizes into two branches as
\be
\label{secu}
\tan(\pi \om) = \pm \frac{ (e'-e) \om}{\om^2 + e e'}
\ee
The upper sign corresponds to the first transverse direction $x$, the
lower one to the second direction $y$. 
We shall focus on the first, and obtain the second by 
reversing $(e,e')$ simultaneously. 

Let us first assume $ee'>0$. One has to look at the intersection
points of the ``derived Lorentzian curve'' on the {\sc rhs } with
the tangent on the {\sc lhs }. The secular equation therefore
selects one real eigenmode $\omega_n$ in any interval
$[n\pi,(n+1)\pi[$, $n\in \mathbb{N}^*$, with wave function
\be
\label{genmodestr}
X_n(\tau,\sigma)= {\cal N}_n \left( 
\text{e}^{-i\om_n(\tau-\sigma)} + 
\frac{i\om_n-e}{i\om_n+e} \text{e}^{-i\om_n (\tau-\sigma)} \right) a_n 
+ cc
\ee
where the normalization factor ${\cal N}_n$ is chosen so that 
the Poisson brackets of $a_n,a_m$ are normalized to 
$\{a_n,a_m^\star\}=\delta_{m,n}$. 

The situation for the 
first segment $[0,\pi[$ is more subtle however: when 
$D=e'-e - \pi e e'<0$, the slope of the {\sc rhs } at the origin is less
than that of the {\sc lhs }, so there is a single real root $\omega_0$ in $[0,\pi[$,
with the same wave function $X_0$ as \eqref{genmode}. As
$D$ approaches 0, the real root $\omega_0$ collides with its opposite
$-\omega_0$, leading to a pair of canonically conjugate modes with
vanishing frequency. Their wave function can be obtained from 
the $\omega_n\to 0$ limit of \eqref{genmode}, and reads
\be
X_c(\tau,\sigma)=\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi(3(1-e\pi)+e^2\pi^2)}} 
(1-e\sigma)(x_0+p_0 t)
\ee
where again the normalization is chosen so as to get canonical
brackets, $\{x_0,p_0\}=1$.
Those are exactly the macroscopic strings described in the previous
section, occurring at a critical value of the gradient of the electric field.
As $D$ becomes negative, these two roots leave the real axis and
become purely imaginary, $\omega_0^\pm = \pm i k$. These corresponds to
unstable modes, with wave function
\be
\label{genmode2bk}
X_\pm(\tau,\sigma)= \left(
\text{e}^{\pm k(\tau-\sigma)} + 
\frac{\mp k-e}{\mp k+e} \text{e}^{\pm k (\tau-\sigma)} \right) a_{\pm}
\ , \quad \{a_\pm,a_\pm\}=1
\ee

Let us now briefly discuss the case $ee'<0$. The {\sc rhs } of \eqref{secu} now has a
pole at $\omega=\pm \sqrt{-ee'}$, whose location has to be compared to
that of the poles of the tangent on the {\sc lhs }, $\omega=(n+1/2)$, $n\in
\mathbb{Z}$. It is easy to see that there still is a solution of the
secular equation for all intervals $[n\pi,(n+1)\pi[$ except for
one of them. The missing solution corresponds to a pair of 
complex conjugate root. We will not discuss this case any further.

We can now expand the embedding coordinate $X$ in normal modes,
\bse \label{modexpansion}
\begin{gather}
X(\tau,\sigma) = 
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} X_n
+ \begin{cases}
D<0:& X_0  \\
D=0:& X_c  \\
D>0:& X_+ + X_- \\
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
\ese
with canonical commutation relations,
\begin{gather}
\{a_n,a_m\} = \delta_{n+m}\ , \{x_0,p_0\}=1\ , 
\end{gather}
The contribution of the $X$ coordinate to the Hamiltonian 
can be evaluated in terms of these variables, and reads
\be
H_X= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \omega_n a_n a_n^\star
+\begin{cases}
D<0:& \omega_0 a_0 a_0^\star \\
D=0:&  p_0^2 \\
D>0:& k a_+ a_-
\end{cases}
\ee
To this must be added the contribution of the $Y$ variables, which has
a similar mode expansion but with $D_Y=e-e' - \pi e e'$.

\item[$\gamma$)] {\it Crossed:} In order to study the effects of non-commuting
gradients, we choose 
\be
h_0 = e \begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\ & -1 \end{pmatrix}\ ,\quad
h_1 = e' \begin{pmatrix}  & 1 \\ 1 &  \end{pmatrix}
\ee 
The secular equation still factorizes into
\be\label{sec2}
\tan(\pi \om) = \pm \frac{\om~ \sqrt{e^2 + e^{'2}}}{\sqrt{\om^4 + e^2 e^{'2}}}
\ee
The structure of roots is similar to the aligned case:
except that the
critical line is now at $D=e^2+e^{'2}-\pi^2 e^2 e'^2=0$,
at which the slopes of the two sides of  \eqref{sec2} with the
upper side coincide at $\omega=0$ {\tt discuss lower sign
separately}. As before, for
all $n>0$ there exists a real root in $[n\pi,(n+1)\pi[$. 
If $D<0$ is negative, there also exists a real root $\omega_0$ in $[0,\pi[$.
As $D\to 0$, this roots collides with its opposite and leaves the
real axis. For $D>0$, we have a pair of complex conjugate roots
$\omega=\pm ik$ corresponding to the instability described 
in the previous section. At $D=0$, we have macroscopic strings 
with arbitrary length,
\be
\begin{pmatrix} X_c\\Y_c \end{pmatrix}=
\sqrt{\frac{3(e^2 \pi-1)}{2 e^3 \pi^4}}  (x_0 + p_0 t)
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{1-e p^+ \sigma}{\sqrt{e\pi p^+ -1}} \\
\frac{1+e p^+ \sigma}{\sqrt{e\pi p^+ +1}} 
\end{pmatrix}
\ee
and fixed angle $X_c/Y_c=\sqrt{(e\pi+1)/(e\pi-1)}$.
The Hamiltonian can be evaluated on this configuration and reads
\be
H= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \omega_n a_n a_n^\star 
+ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \tilde\omega_n \tilde a_n \tilde a_n^\star
+\begin{cases}
D<0:& \omega_0 a_0 a_0^\star \\
D=0:& p_0^2 \\ 
D>0:& k a_+ a_-
\end{cases}
\ee
%where the signs depend on the choice of branch of $D$.
