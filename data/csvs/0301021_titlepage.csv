\abstract{The low-energy effective action of type-I superstring theory 
in ten dimensions is obtained performing a truncation of type-IIB supergravity
in a background where D9-branes are present. 
The open sector corresponds to the first order in the low-energy 
expansion of the D9-brane action in a type-I
background. In hep-th/9901055 it was shown that there are two ways of performing 
a type-I truncation of the D9-brane action, and the resulting truncated action 
was obtained in a flat background. We extend this result to a generic type-I background,
and argue that the two different truncations are in correspondence with 
the open sector of the low-energy effective action of the two different consistent
ten-dimensional type-I string theories, namely the $SO(32)$ superstring and the 
$USp(32)$ non-supersymmetric string.}
