The non-perturbation and perturbation structures of
the $q$-deformed probability currents are studied.
According to two ways of realizing the $q$-deformed Heisenberg algebra
by the undeformed operators,
the perturbation  structures of two $q$-deformed probability currents
 are explored in detail.
Locally the structures of two  perturbation $q$-deformed  probability
 currents are different,
one is explicitly potential dependent; the other is  not.
But their total contributions  to the whole space are the same.
