The strong magnetic field behaviour of the fermion-induced
effective energy in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic
field, has recently attract attention, see Refs.
\cite{1,2,3,5,2str}. In Ref. \cite{3}, we presented an asymptotic
formula for the fermion-induced effective energy in 3+1 dimensions
in the presence of a cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous strong
magnetic field of finite magnetic flux $\Phi$. However, the proof
of the formula was presented in a condensed form and there are
some points which were not clearly explained. The aim of this work
is to present the complete proof in detail.
