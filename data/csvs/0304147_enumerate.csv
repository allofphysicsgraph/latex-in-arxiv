\item In one kind of solution, the particle can reach $z=0$ at some finite value of $\rho$. 
This happens when $\beta=0$, $\Lambda_6>0$ and $E>0$  (fig.\ 1a), or when $\beta=0$, 
$\Lambda_6<0,\
\Lambda_4<0$ and $z<z_m$ (fig.\ 1b).   Some curvature invariants diverge, so the extra
dimensions end at a singularity with the topology of $S_1$ in this case \cite{Gio}.  

\item Another kind is where $z\to\infty$ as $\rho\to\infty$, as occurs if $\Lambda_6<0$ and
$\Lambda_4\ge 0$, or if $\Lambda_6<0$, $\Lambda_4 < 0$ and $z>z_m$. Then gravity will not be localized,
and the world does not look 4-dimensional to an observer on the brane.  A special case of this
kind is the AdS soliton solution \cite{HM}, where $\beta=\Lambda_4=0$.

\item A third possibility is that the particle starts to the left of a stable
equilibrium position, in which case it comes to rest again at the other side of the
minimum at some maximum value of $\rho=\rho_m$.  The vanishing of $z'$ means that the
space closes off at $\rho_m$, and we can consistently insert a second 3-brane at this
position. The extra dimensions look like $S_2$ deformed by deficit angles due to the two
3-branes at antipodal points.  A special case \cite{CG,nav} is when the particle stays
at rest at the equilibrium position.  This gives an unwarped solution since $M(\rho)$
remains constant.  Nonvanishing magnetic flux $\beta$ is required to obtain static
solutions of this kind.

\item One can also find special unwarped solutions when the particle sits at an unstable
equilibrium position, denoted in fig.\ 1 by $z_m$, in the case of an AdS 3-brane.  Since
we are interested in cosmological solutions, we do not pursue these here.
