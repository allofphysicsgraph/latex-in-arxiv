Penrose limits
-----------------

The penrose limit is constructed as follows \cite{Penrose}:
starting with a solution of the Einstein equations, we zoom in on the neighborhood
of a null geodesic by choosing coordinates adapted to the it and then scaling
the metric by a constant factor in such a way that the neighborhood of the
null geodesic is expanded off to infinity. Taking advantage of the homogeneous
scaling of the lagrangian under this transformation, we see that any solutions
of the field equations remain solutions of the same equations after the limit.
.
This procedure always generates a plane-wave space-time which solves Einstein's
equations, and generically can have non-zero curvature.

The Weyl tensor of any plane-wave is either null or vanishes.

Gueven \cite{Gueven:2000ru} has generalized the Penrose limit \cite{Penrose}
to the low energy effective field theories arising from the five
superstring theorires, with NS-NS, RR and Yang-Mills potentials,
and demonstrated that the leading order 

The solutions after the plane-wave limit possess at least as much
supersymmetry as the original solution, but may also exhibit an
enhancement of the number of killing spinors.  In particular, there is a
minimum amount of supersymmetry after the limit (see also
\cite{Cvetic}).
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The Penrose limit is generalized to show that, any leading order solution of the low-energy field equations in any one of the
%five string theories has a plane-wave solution as a limit. This limiting procedure takes into account all the massless fields that
%may arise and commutes with the T-duality so that any dual solution has again a plane-wave limit. The scaling rules used in
%the limit are unique and stem from the scaling property of the D=11 supergravity action. Although the leading order solutions
%need not be exact or supersymmetric, their plane-wave limits always preserve some portion of the Poincare supersymmetry
%and solve the relevant field equations in all powers of the string tension parameter. Further properties of the limiting procedure
%are discussed. 

% This needs a general proof
For plane-wave backgrounds where RR flux is present, the supersymmetry is
typically determined by the gravitino susy variations, with the dilatino variations
giving a redundant counting.
For a constant dilaton plane-wave background supporting only NS-NS flux,
the supersymmetry is determined completely by the dilatino susy variation,
the gravitino variations being redundant.  

%Choose an orthonormal basis $\hat{e}_{(a)}$ in the tangent space at each point of the
%sphere $S^{d}$
%with $\delta_{ab}$ the Euclidean metric.

We present here a brief recapitulation of relevent earlier work on
non-linear sigma models and their renormalization.
In \cite{Curtright:1984dz, Braaten:is}, a simple geometrical interpretation was given
for the renormalization group flow in certain supersymmetric non-linear sigma models
where Wess-Zumino
\cite{Wess:yu,Witten:tx} terms are present.  These terms were interpreted as the
addition of torsion to the connection on the target manifold.
The renormalization flow can be interpreted as a geometrical deformation
of the target space manifold.  When Wess-Zumino terms are absent,
the geometric flow depends on the Riemannian curvature of the target
manifold \cite{Friedan:1980jf, Friedan:1980jm}.  
With the addition of Wess-Zumino terms, a similar interpretation
may be given, however, the curvature in this case is derived from a
connection with torsion.
In the case of Wess-Zumino-Witten models, where the target
space is a group manifold, the torsion is derived from the structure
constants of the Lie group \cite{Goldberg}.
The genralized connection with torsion
constructed in this manner may ""flatten""
the manifold, i.e. cause the curvature to vanish.
In this case the manifold is said to be parallelized,
\cite{Cartan-Schouten,Einstein}
An interesting result of this parallelization is the existence of renormalization
group fixed points whose origin is given a geometrical interpretation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The metric (\ref{plane-wave-metric}) is in Brinkman form.
It can be put into a form which makes the extra planar symmetry
manifest
\begin{equation}
ds^2 \: = \:
- 2 dU dV + H_{ij} (U) dX^i dX^j
\end{equation}
This is known as the Rosen form of the metric.
It suffer from the deficiency that it is has coordinated
singularities where $det(H_{ij}(U))$ vanishes, and Rosen \cite{}
has shown that non-flat vacuum metric in this form 
posesses singularities when the range of the coordinate system is 
extended to cover the whole space-time. However, such singularities are
only coordinate singularities and can be evaded through the use of 
multiple overlapping coordinate systems, with the metric in each 
coordinate patch still of the Rosen form.
The coordinate transformation from Brinkman to Rosen form can be found in
\cite{Blau:2002mw}.

These plane-wave solutions generally arise as Penrose limits \cite{}
of other space-times.
The non-zerocomponents of the Riemann and Ricci tensors
arising from the plane-wave metric
(\ref{plane-wave-metric}) are
\begin{equation}
R_{uiuj} \: = \: \frac{1}{2} ( 1 + \delta_{ij} ) f_{ij} (u)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{uu} \: = \: \frac{1}{2} \hat\nabla^2 ( f_{ij}(u) x^i x^j )
\end{equation}
with $i,j$ coordinates on the transverse space, and $\hat\nabla$ the
laplacian on the transverse space.
In vacuum, the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar then
vanish by virtue of the traceless-ness of $f_{ij}$.
Finally, dropping the dependence of $f_{ij}$ on $u$, we arrive
at the {\it homogeneous} plane-waves.

As we will see, choosing the torsion to equal the
NS three form field strength with an appropriate normalization
allows us to write the supergravity equations of motions as

The parallel with string theory, where a similar Wess-Zumino term arises 
in the covariant superstring action \cite{Henneaus-Mezincescu},
corresponding to the antisymmetric NS B-field,
will be exploited in this paper.
As discussed in \cite{Curtright-Zachos, Braaten-Curtright-Zachos}, such
parallelism in a supersymmetric non-linear sigma model
may lead to a conformally invariant fixed point in the
renormalization group flow, and can be seen to have a geometrical
nature when interpreted in terms of the generalized connection.
The normalization of the Wess-Zumino term is fixed by local
supersymmetry on the worldsheet, and yields a torsion which
parallelizes the target space, leading again to interesteing non-trivial
fixed points. The persistence of such fixed points to two-loop order
has been demonstrated in the supersymmetric case by
\cite{Braated-Curtright-Zachos}, where it is also conjectured to
survive to all orders in perturbation theory via a local equivalence
to free field theories at these fixed points.
\cite{Muki} demonstrated the on-shell ultraviolet finiteness
of non-linear sigma models with Wess-Zumino terms that parallelize
the target space manifold, to all orders in perturbation theory.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The dynamics of the massless sector of string theory at low energy
is described by an effective theory taking the form of a supergravity
theory on the target space-time of the string $\sigma$-model.
Two approaches to establishing this effective action exist.
In the first approach \cite{Scherk:etal},
one may write the most general action reflecting the space-time
symmetries of the massless modes of the string theory.
Tree-level (in $g_s$) S-matrix computations are then performed in the string
theory, at some loop order in $\alpha^\prime$. The coefficients
appearing in the space-time effective action are then fixed by the
requirement that scattering at low energy in the two theories
coincide. Solutions of the equations of motion of for this effective theory
might display a perturbative nature in $\alpha^\prime$.
The second approach \cite{Weyl_inv} is to compute the renormalization group
$\beta$ functions (or Weyl anomaly ) for the couplings in the string $\sigma$-model.
The requirement of Weyl invariance of the string theory, in the
form of the vanishing of the $\beta$ function (again, to some order
in $\sigma$-model perturbation theory), then yields the
equations of motion which can then be used to construct the low-energy
supergravity effective action. The couplings of the worlsheet theory
appear as the fundamental fields in the supergravity action.

Metsaev and Tseytlin
\cite{Metsaev-Tseytlin} have demonstrated that parallelizable spaces
yield solutions of the string effective action
to order $(\alpha^{\prime})^{2}$, and have also shown that the
effective action can be recast in a form involving the curvature
derived from a generalized connection with the addition of torsion
(the so called ""string torsion""),
arising from the sigma model Wess-Zumino antisymmetric coupling.
The two-loop correction to the $\beta$ function for a metric corresponding
to a parallelizable target space manifold is
shown to vanish in a particular renormalization scheme, and for a
deformation of the manifold in other renormalization schemes.
