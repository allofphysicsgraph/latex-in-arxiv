For an effective treatment of the evaporation process of a large
black hole the problem concerning the role played by the
fluctuations of the (vacuum) stress tensor close to the horizon
is addressed. We present arguments which establish a principal
relationship between the outwards fluctuations of the stress
tensor close to the horizon and quantities describing the onset of
the evaporation process. This suggest that the evaporation
process may be described by a fluctuation-dissipation theorem
relating the noise of the horizon to the black hole evaporation
rate.
