When $\tau \rightarrow 0$ for any $ n$, the same
change of variables to logarithmic time $t$ reduces these equations to
the same form as the particle case of class I,  containing, however,  an
interesting correction in the constant term proportional to $f_{ij}$.
This case can be studied using the same
methods that we develop below, and then this limit becomes the basis
for an expansion of the solution around $\tau = 0$.
\item
When $\tau \rightarrow \infty$ all
$\tau $ dependent terms go to zero and we find just a string in flat space.

\item
the frequencies are the roots of $M$
\item
the eigen-directions of the frequencies are
constructed from the minors of $M$
\item
the commutators of the $\xi$'s are determined
by the frequencies.
