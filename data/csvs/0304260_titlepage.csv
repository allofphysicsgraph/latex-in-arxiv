\begin{abstract}
We propose TBA integral equations for multiparticle soliton (fermion)
states in the Sine-Gordon (massive Thirring) model. 
This is based on T-system and Y-system
equations, which follow from the Bethe Ansatz solution in the light-cone 
lattice formulation of the model. Even and odd charge sectors are
treated on an equal footing, corresponding to periodic and twisted
boundary conditions, respectively. The analytic properties of the Y-system  
functions are conjectured on the basis of the large volume solution of
the system, which we find explicitly. A simple relation between the TBA
Y-functions and the counting function variable of the alternative
non-linear integral equation (Destri-deVega equation) description
of the model is given. At the special value $\beta^2=6\pi$ of the
Sine-Gordon coupling exact expressions for energy and momentum
eigenvalues of one-particle states are found.
