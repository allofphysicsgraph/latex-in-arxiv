The problem of confinement of neutral fermions in two-dimensional space-time
is approached with a pseudoscalar double-step potential in the Dirac
equation. Bound-state solutions are obtained when the coupling is of
sufficient intensity. The confinement is made plausible by arguments based
on effective mass and anomalous magnetic interaction.
