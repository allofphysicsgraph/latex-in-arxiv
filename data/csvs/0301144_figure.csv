\caption{The universe for $D =6$ and $k = 1, ~\omega_6 M =100, ~\Lambda_6 
= .001$. 
It begins at a finite size and expands for ever.
Here and in other figures, all the quantities are measured in 
appropriate powers of length.}

\caption{The universe for $D =6$ and  $\omega_6 M =100,
~\Lambda_6 = 1.$ Here $k =-1$ corresponds to the solid line while
dotted
line is for $k =0$. In both cases, the universe begins from 
singularity and expands for ever. }

\caption{Evolution of the brane in $D=5$ for $\omega_5 M = 500,~\Lambda_5 
=
.01$. The dotted, dashed and solid lines correspond to $k = 0, 1, -1$
respectively.}

\caption{The universe for $k = -1, 0, 1$ are shown in solid, dotted and
dashed lines respectively for $D = 5, ~\omega_5 M = 500, ~\omega_5 Q=1$ 
and $\Lambda_5 = 0$. 
As can be seen, in 
all these cases, big bang like singularities are absent.}

\caption{This shows typical behaviour of the universe for $\Lambda_4 =1$.
Here again $k =-1, 0, 1$ are shown in solid, dotted and dashed lines for
$D=4,~\omega_4 M = 50, ~\omega_4 Q =0.1$. Universe begins at a finite size 
and expands at
late time.}

\centerline{\epsfbox{NegL.epsi}}
\caption{This shows typical behaviour of the universe for $\Lambda_4 = 
-1$. 
$k =-1,0,1$ are shown in solid, dotted and dashed lines for $D 
=4,~\omega_4 M
=100,~\omega_4 Q = 0.1$. Universe begins at non-zero size and ends at 
finite size. 
Instabilities arise below the minimum and above the maximum radii.}
