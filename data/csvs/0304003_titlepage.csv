We consider supersymmetric sigma models on the K\""ahler target 
spaces, with 
twisted mass. The K\""ahler spaces are assumed to have holomorphic
Killing vectors.
 Introduction of a superpotential of a special type is known
to be consistent with ${\cal N}=2$ superalgebra (Alvarez-Gaum\'{e} and Freedman).
We show that the algebra acquires 
{\em central charges} in the anticommutators
$\{ Q_L, Q_L\}$ and $\{ Q_R, Q_R\}$.
These central charges have no parallels,
and they can exist only in two dimensions.
The central extension of the ${\cal N}=2$ superalgebra
we found paves the way to a novel phenomenon ---
spontaneous breaking of a part of supersymmetry.
In the general case 1/2 of supersymmetry is spontaneously
broken (the vacuum energy density is positive),
 while the remaining 1/2 is realized linearly. 
In the model at hand the standard fermion number is not defined,
so that   the Witten index as well as the
Cecotti-Fendley-Intriligator-Vafa index are useless.
We show how to construct an index  for 
counting short multiplets in internal algebraic terms
which is well-defined in spite of the absence of the standard fermion number.
Finally, we outline derivation of the {\em quantum anomaly} in
the anticommutator $\{ \bar Q_L, Q_R\}$.
