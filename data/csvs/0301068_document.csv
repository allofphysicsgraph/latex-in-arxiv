\begin{quote}

We present a simple group representation analysis of massive, and 
particularly ``partially massless'', fields of arbitrary 
spin in de Sitter spaces 
of any dimension. 
The method uses bulk to boundary propagators to relate 
these fields to Euclidean conformal ones at one dimension lower.
These results are then used to revisit an old question:
can a consistent de Sitter supergravity be 
constructed, at least within its intrinsic horizon?

\section{Introduction}

In addition to (perhaps) being our macroscopic habitat~\cite{Carroll:2000fy}, 
the conformally flat, constant curvature, de Sitter (dS) 
space has 
long been a 
seminal laboratory for field theory in curved backgrounds, being the 
simplest possible generalization of the Minkowski vacuum.
Indeed,~dS effects on a spin 1/2 field's 
propagation were first studied seven decades ago~\cite{Dirac:1935}.
Ever since, systems 
of all spins and masses have been analyzed in both~dS and anti de Sitter
(AdS), with obvious connections to string expansions\footnote{A
detailed analysis of partially massless representations has 
previously been given
by solving the Laplace equation on spheres for higher spin harmonics
and then analytically continuing these solutions to~dS
space~\cite{Higuchi:1987wu}. Although this analysis has the advantage 
of applying to the entire~dS space, it is rather complicated
and the simple interpretation of partially massless fields in terms
of missing lower helicity states is obscured.}.
A particularly striking effect, that of partial masslessness or partial gauge 
invariance, arising first at spin 2~\cite{Deser:1983tm,Deser:1984mm}, 
was recently discussed by us in some 
detail~\cite{Deser:2001xr,Deser:2001wx,Deser:2001us,Deser:2001pe,Deser:2001dt}. 
(see also~\cite{Zinoviev:2001dt,Dolan:2001ih}).
The purpose of the present work is 
twofold :  First, we formalize the kinematics underlying these 
properties in a group theoretic context, using a~dS/CFT
correspondence between $\rm dS_{n+1}$ 
and Euclidean space ${\mathbb R}^n$. This will 
exhibit the details of partial masslessness for all spin, in all 
dimensions $d=n+1$, as 
well as the ensuing propagation properties at these 
thresholds\footnote{Note that
the partial masslessness phenomenon occurs in AdS as well. In that
case, however, only strictly massless representations are unitary. The
representation theory of these fields is much easier to understand,
since the algebra can be graded with respect to the generator
of the $SO(2)$ factor of the maximal compact subgroup of the
AdS isometry group. Partially massless
representations are obtained by searching for null descendants. We
thank M. Vassiliev for pointing this out to us.}.  Secondly, we will use the 
above systematics to reassess the case for (and against) extending models of 
cosmological supergravity from their natural AdS arena to~dS.  Before 
proceeding to details, we immediately disclaim any global ambitions for~dS:  
we will be working primarily on one patch of the full~dS, and 
there only within its intrinsic event horizon, this being the lamppost under 
which the physics is (relatively) clear.

In Section~\ref{dS_space}, 
we review the description of~dS as a coset and the corresponding 
algebra as that of the Euclidean conformal group in one lower
dimension.  
Section~\ref{SCAL} 
illustrates our method in the simplest case of scalar fields.  We will 
relate fields in $\rm dS_{n+1}$ 
with conformal ones on ${\mathbb R}^n$ by using an intertwiner, 
essentially establishing a (dS/CFT) correspondence in terms of a proper time 
propagator.  In Section~\ref{BOSONS}, 
we generalize to bosons of arbitrary spin.  We next 
apply the above results to partially massless higher spin bosons, where 
discrete ratios of (mass)$^2$ to cosmological constant imply light cone 
propagation and (partial) gauge invariances.  In
Section~\ref{Fermions} we treat fermions in  
the {\it a priori} hostile~dS context.  Finally, in Section~\ref{SUGRA}, we
revisit the old  
question of the extent, if any, to which a~dS supergravity can be viable, 
presenting the pros and cons in terms of our framework.  


\section{de Sitter Space}

\label{dS_space}

The~dS$_{n+1}$ spacetime is the coset $SO(n+1,1)/SO(n,1)$
and is geometrically described by 
the one sheeted hyperboloid\footnote{Our index conventions
are $M,N=0,\ldots {n+1}$, raised and lowered by the Minkowski metric of the
$(n+1)+1$ dimensional embedding space 
$\eta_{MN}={\rm diag}(-,+,\ldots,+)_{MN}$;   
$i,j=1,\ldots,n$ (also denoted by vectors),
covariant with respect to the $SO(n)$ subgroup generated by $M_{ij}$, raised
and lowered by the Kronecker delta. 
}
\be
Z^MZ_M=-(Z^0)^2+\sum_{i=1}^n(Z^i)^2+(Z^{n+1})^2=1\, ,
\label{hyperboloid}
\ee 
embedded in $\mathbb R^{({n+1},1)}$. The cosmological constant
$\Lambda$ 
is positive in~dS space and usually enters the
equation~\eqn{hyperboloid} 
as $n/\Lambda$ on the right hand side. We will work in units $\Lambda=n$ 
throughout, 
however. 


The~dS group $SO({n+1},1)$
acts naturally on $\mathbb R^{({n+1},1)}$ with generators
\be
M_{MN}=i(Z_M\d_N-Z_N\d_M)
\ee
obeying the Lie algebra
\be
[M_{MN},M_{RS}]=i\eta_{NR}M_{MS}-i\eta_{NS}M_{MR}
+i\eta_{MS}M_{NR}-i\eta_{MR}M_{NS}\, .
\label{Lie}
\ee
We will employ a coordinate system 
in which spatial sections are flat and therefore rewrite this algebra
in terms of
\be
P_i\equiv M_{i0}+M_{{n+1},i}\, ,\qquad
D\equiv M_{{n+1},0}\, ,\qquad
K_i\equiv M_{i0}-M_{{n+1},i}\, ,
\label{gens0}
\ee
and $M_{ij}$ so that
\bea
&[P_i,P_j]=0\, ,\qquad [K_i,K_j]=0\, ,&\nn\\ \nn\\
&{}[D,P_i]=iP_i\, ,\qquad [D,M_{ij}]=0\, ,\qquad [D,K_i]=-iK_i\, ,&\nn\\ \nn \\
&{}[M_{ij},P_k]=i(P_i\delta_{jk}-P_j\delta_{ik})\, ,\qquad
{}[M_{ij},K_k]=i(K_i\delta_{jk}-K_j\delta_{ik})\, ,&\nn\\\nn\\
&{}[P_i,K_j]=-2i\delta_{ij}D+2iM_{ij}\, .&\label{lie}
\eea
The generators 
$M_{ij}$ satisfy the $so(n)$ angular momentum Lie algebra, so identifying 
the remaining generators $P_i$ as momenta, $D$ as dilations
and $K_i$ as conformal boosts, we see that the algebra~\eqn{lie} generates
the Euclidean conformal group in $n$ dimensions.
To make the relation between the coset $SO({n+1},1)/SO(n,1)$ and
hyperboloid~\eqn{hyperboloid}
explicit, we begin by introducing the
matrix representation of the generators~\eqn{gens0}
\be
P_i=i
\left(
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
0&\vec e_i&0\\\hline
\vec e_i^\top&\!\!\!\!{}_{\phantom{A^A}}0^{\phantom{A^A}}\!\!\!\!&
\vec e_i^\top\\\hline
0&-\vec e_i&0
\end{array}
\right) ,\quad\!\!\!\!
D=i
\left(
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
0&0&-1\\\hline
0&0&0\\\hline
-1&0&0
\end{array}
\right) ,\quad\!\!\!\!
K_i=i
\left(
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
0&\vec e_i&0\\\hline
\vec e_i^\top&
\!\!\!\!{}_{\phantom{A^A}}0^{\phantom{A^A}}\!\!\!\!&-\vec e_i^\top\\\hline
0&\vec e_i&0
\end{array}
\right) .
\label{gens}
\ee
[All entries of the $n$ dimensional vector $\vec e_i$ 
vanish save for the $i^{\rm th}$ slot which is unity.]
Now choose a standard vector $X^M=(0,\ldots,0,1)$. Since this is the
defining representation of $SO({n+1},1)$, the vector $Z^M=(gX)^M$
satisfies the hyperboloid condition~\eqn{hyperboloid} for any $g\in
SO(n+1,1)$ and in fact the entire~dS space can be obtained this
way. The stabilizer of $X^M$ is the subgroup $SO(n,1)\subset SO(n+1,1)$,
therefore $dS_{n+1}\cong SO(n+1,1)/ SO(n,1)$.
