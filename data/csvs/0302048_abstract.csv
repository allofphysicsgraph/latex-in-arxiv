The structure of the electroweak theory is suggested by classical
geometrical ideas. A nonlinear map is constructed,
from a 12-dimensional linear space of three Weyl spinors onto the
12-dimensional tangent bundle of the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal
tetrads associated with the Lorentz group --- except, inevitably, for a
set of measure zero. In the approach of this paper, the electroweak field
is more natural than the Dirac field. This may be just a curiosity since it
may not survive quantization, but it suggests a path to bosonization of
the electroweak field in (3+1) dimensions.
