We discuss domain walls and vacuum energy density
(cosmological constant)  in ${\cal N}=1\ $ gluodynamics and in
 non-supersymmetric large $N$ orientifold
field theories which have been
recently shown to be planar equivalent
(in the boson sector)  to ${\cal N}=1\ $ gluodynamics.
A relation between the vanishing force
between two parallel walls and vanishing cosmological constant
is pointed out. This relation may
 explain why 
 the cosmological constant vanishes  in the orientifold field theory
at leading order although the hadronic spectrum of this theory
does not contain fermions  in the limit $N\to\infty$. 
The cancellation is among
even and odd parity bosonic contributions, due to NS-NS and R-R
cancellations in the annulus amplitude of the underlying string theory.
We  use the open-closed string channel duality to describe interaction
between the domain walls which is interpreted
as the exchange of composite ``dilatons'' and ``axions''
coupled to the walls.
Finally, we study some planar equivalent pairs
in which both theories in the parent-daughter pair are
non-supersymmetric.
