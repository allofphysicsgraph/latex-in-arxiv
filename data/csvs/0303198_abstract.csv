Using a reformulation of the  method of $(p,q)$ webs, we study the  
four-dimensional  $N=1$ quiver theories from M-theory on seven-dimensional 
manifolds with $G_2$ holonomy.  We first  construct such 
manifolds  as  $ U(1)$   
quotients  of eight-dimensional toric hyper-K\""ahler manifolds, using 
$N=4$ supersymmetric  sigma  models.  We show that these geometries, 
in general, are given by real cones on $\bf S^2$ bundles   
over complex two-dimensional toric varieties, $ \cal \bf V^2=
{{\bf C}^{r+2}/ {{\bf C}^*}^r}$.  Then we discuss the connection  
between  the  physics content of M-theory on such  $G_2$ manifolds and 
the method of $(p,q)$ webs.  Motivated by a result of Acharya  
and  Witten [hep-th/0109152], we reformulate the method of $(p,q)$ 
webs  and reconsider the derivation of the gauge theories using toric geometry 
Mori vectors  of  $ \cal \bf V^2$ and  
brane charge constraints.  For ${\bf WP^2}_{w_1,w_2, w_3}$, we 
find that the gauge group is given by 
$ G=U( w_1n)\times U(w_2n)\times U(w_3n)$. This is
required by the anomaly cancellation condition.
