We show that renormalized non-commutative scalar field theories do not
reduce to their planar sector in the limit of large non-commutativity.
This follows from the fact that the RG equation of the
Wilson-Polchinski type which describes the genus zero sector of
non-commutative field theories couples generic planar amplitudes with
non-planar amplitudes at exceptional values of the external
momenta. We prove that the renormalization problem can be consistently
restricted to this set of amplitudes. In the resulting renormalized
theory non-planar divergences are treated as UV divergences requiring
appropriate non-local counterterms. In 4 dimensions the model turns
out to have one more relevant (non-planar) coupling than its
commutative counterpart. This non-planar coupling is ``evanescent'':
although in the massive (but not in the massless) case its
contribution to planar amplitudes vanishes when the floating cut-off
equals the renormalization scale, this coupling is needed to make the
Wilsonian effective action UV finite at {\it all} values of the
floating cut-off.
