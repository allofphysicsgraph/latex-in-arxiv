\begin{abstract}
By treating the bulk--quantized Yang--Mills theory as a constrained
system we obtain a consistent gauge--fixed BRST hamiltonian
in the minimal sector.  This provides an independent
derivation of  the 5--$d$ lagrangian bulk action.
The ground state is independent of the (anti)ghosts
and is interpreted as the solution
of the Fokker--Planck equation, thus establishing a
direct connection to the Fokker--Planck hamiltonian.
The vacuum state correlators are shown to be in agreement
with correlators in lagrangian 5--$d$ formulation.
It is verified  that the complete propagators  remain parabolic
in one--loop dimensional regularization.

\section{\bf{Introduction}}

The usual formulation~\cite{Pesk} of
4--$d$ gauge theory is based on the free
(euclidean) lagrangian action
\bea
S=\qrtr\int_{{\cal M}^4}dx\, F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
\eea
 where
$F_{\mu\nu}=\p_{[\mu} A_{\nu]} + [A_\mu,A_\nu]$ is the curvature
of an $\mrm{SU(N)}$ connection $A$.
In recently introduced
\emph{bulk quantization}~\cite{BaZwQCD,BaZwScal,BaGrZw,BaZwGauge}
(that arose from stochastic quantization approaches
based on ideas of Parisi and Wu~\cite{Stoch,Stoch2})
 one adds an extra fifth nonphysical
dimension $t$ to the spacetime $4$--manifold  ${\cal M}^4$.
All the fields of the theory are then defined on
the extended spacetime
$$\vph(x), \> x \in {\cal M}^4 \>\lgra\>
\vph(t,x), \> (t,x) \in {\mbf R} \cross {\cal M}^4$$
(This $t$ corresponds to the stochastic evolution parameter
or the Monte Carlo iteration time for numerical simulation).
The connection $A_\mu dx^\mu$ is extended to include a fifth
component $A_5dt$ and one has
$F_{5\mu} = \p_5 A_\mu - \p_\mu A_5 +[A_5,A_\mu].$

A set of ghost fields is introduced with two independent
$\mbf Z$--gradings (ghost numbers) $\gh_s$ and $\gh_w$
corresponding to BRST differentials $s$ and $w$, which
raise the respective ghost numbers by one and satisfy
\bea
(s+w)^2=0\>\Ra \>s^2=0,\>w^2=0,\>sw=-ws
\eea
The operator $w$ provides a BRST implementation of the 5--$d$
gauge symmetry, analogous to the usual BRST operator~\cite{Bert,Bau}
(usually called $s$!) connected with
Faddeev--Popov ghosts.  Its cohomology $H^0(w)$ defines
observables. The operator $s$ acts like a rigid
supersymmetry operator and has trivial cohomology.
Observables are \emph{not} required to be $s$--exact.
Fields with
odd total ghost number $\gh \equiv\gh_s +\gh_w$ anticommute.
The action of $s$ and $w$ on the fields is defined as
\begin{align}\label{BrsAlg}
  sA_\mu&=\Psi_\mu & s\Psi_\mu &=0 &
  s\Psib_\mu &=\Pi_\mu & s\Pi_\mu&=0\nn\\
  sA_5&=\Psi_5 & s\Psi_5&=0 &
 s\Psib_5&=\Pi_5 & s\Pi_5&=0\nn\\
   sc&=\Phi & s\Phi&=0 & s\Phib&=\bar c & s\bar c&=0\nn\\
  s\lam&=\mu & s\mu&=0 & s\mub&=\lamb & s\lamb&=0\nn\\[-8pt]
    & & & & & & &
\end{align}\vspace{-34pt}
\begin{align}
 wA_\nu&=D_\nu\lam & w\Psi_\nu = -[&\lam,\Psi_\nu] -D_\nu\mu &
   w\Psib_\nu =& -[\lam,\Psib_\nu]
     & w\Pi_\nu =& -[\lam,\Pi_\nu] + [\mu,\Psib_\nu]\nn\\
wA_5 &=D_5\lam & w\Psi_5 = -[&\lam,\Psi_5] -D_5\mu &
   w\Psib_5 =& -[\lam,\Psib_5]
     & w\Pi_5 =& -[\lam,\Pi_5] + [\mu,\Psib_5]\nn
\end{align}
\vspace{-32pt}
\begin{align}
 w c =& -[\lam,c] -\mu & w\Phi = -[\lam&,\Phi] + [\mu,c] &
   w\Phib =- &[\lam,\Phib] & w\bar c =-&[\lam,\bar c,]
         + [\mu,\Phib]\nn\\
w\lam =& -\hal[\lam,\lam] & w\mu =-[\lam&,\mu] &
   w\mub = -&[\lam,\mub] +\Psib_5 &
   w\lamb = -&[\lam,\lamb] +[\mu,\mub]+\Pi_5\nn
\end{align}

\flush Here $D_\mu = \p_\mu + [A_\mu,\>]$ and
$D_5 = \p_5 + [A_5,\>]$
denotes the usual gauge covariant
derivative.  With some obvious renaming of fields this is
the BRST algebra of~\cite{BaZwGauge}, with a minor \emph{exception}.
To make the action of $w$ on the
quartet $A_5,\Psi_5,\Psib_5,\Pi_5$ symmetric in form,
as it now is, to the action of $w$ on
$A_\mu,\Psi_\mu,\Psib_\mu,\Pi_\mu$ we made the field redefinitions
\beq
\Psib_5 \equiv \bar m + [\lam,\mub] \2\trm{and}\2
\Pi_5 \equiv -l - [\lam,\lamb] + [\mu,\mub].
\eeq
Otherwise one has in~\cite{BaZwGauge}
\begin{align}%\label{     }
  s\bar m&=l & s l &=0 \nn\\
w\bar \lam &= -l & w l &=0 \nn\\
w\mub &= \bar m & w\bar m &= 0\nn
\end{align}
which, although simpler, lacks the aforementioned symmetry and
moreover leads to more cubic ghost interaction terms in $I_{\trm{gf}}$
than our choice here.

The 5--$d$ action for the theory is $s$--exact and $w$--closed
\vspace{-8pt}\bea
w I = 0\vspace{-18pt}
\eea
and is given by
\bea\label{I}
I \!&=&\! I_0 + I_{\mrm{gf}}\nn\\
I_0 \!&\equiv&\! \int d^5x
   s\Big[ \Psib_\mu\big(F^{5\mu} - D_\lam F^{\lam\mu} + \Pi^\mu
    +[\Psib^\mu,c]\big) + \Phib\big(\Psi_5 - a'^{-1}D_\mu\Psi^\mu
-(D_5  - a'^{-1}D^2)c\big)\Big]\nn\\
I_{\mrm{gf}} \!&\equiv&\! \int d^5x\,
      ws\Big[\mub\(A_5 - a^{-1}\p\!\cdot\!A\)\Big]
\eea where $a$ and $a'$ are positive
constant parameters.
After expansion, the $w$--exact
piece $I_{\mrm{gf}}$ fixes the gauge for $A_{\mu}$ and
$\Psi_{\mu}$ to $A_5 = a^{-1}\p\!\cdot\! A$
and $\Psi_5 = a^{-1}\p\!\cdot\! \Psi$.
The theory is well--defined in this gauge
and one has convergence of longitudinal modes.
From the 4--$d$ point of view this
axial type 5--$d$ gauge condition actually
corresponds to an infinitesimal \emph{gauge transformation} $\de
A_\mu = D_\mu a^{-1}\p\cdot A$, so there is no Gribov obstruction
associated with gauge fixing (see~\cite{BaZwGauge}).

Because all free
ghost propagators are retarded, closed ghost loops
vanish (except for tadpoles which can be ignored).  Since
ghost number is conserved, as long as one doesn't compute ghost
correlators the effect of integrating out the ghosts is simply to
suppress the ghosts in the action which, after integrating
out $\Pi_\mu$ as well and rescaling $t$, yields
\beq
I_{\mrm{red}}' = -\qrtr \int d^5x\,\big[
a^{-1}(\p_tA_\mu - D_\mu\p\!\cdot\!A)^2
+ a(D_\lam F^{\lam\mu})^2\big]
\eeq
After analyzing this action in the Landau gauge limit
$a\!\sea\!0$ one finds that the weight is concentrated
in the Gribov region, i.e., where $\p\!\cdot\! A =0$ and
the Faddeev operator is positive,
$-\p\!\cdot\!D(A) \vgeq 0$.  The
physical content of the 4--$d$ theory, such as correlators, is
recovered by going to a time slice $t=\mrm{constant}$.
The reader is referred to~\cite{BaZwGauge} for details.

We will address here the question of finding the proper
hamiltonian corresponding to (\ref{I}).  An outline of how we
proceed is as follows.  We consider just $I_0$, the gauge non--fixed
part of the action, and read off the hamiltonian, which has
simple first class constraints.  One has a choice of whether or
not to include $A_5, \Psi_5, \Psib_5, \Pi_5$ among the canonical
variables; the phase space without these variables is called the
the \emph{minimal sector}. In the hamiltonian formalism the first
class constraints are generators of gauge transformations, and
hence of $w$. To quantize the system one needs a
BRST gauge--fixed hamiltonian. According to homological
BRST theory,
a ghost--antighost pair is introduced for each constraint and used
to construct a BRST generator $\Om$ for $w$, which we choose to do
in the minimal sector for reasons outlined below. We then
obtain a gauge--fixed hamiltonian $\Hm=\Hm_C -\{\Om,K\}$, the gauge
being fixed by the second term with $K$ chosen
so as to give action $I^{\trm{min}}$ (a reduced form of $I$ that
results after integrating out non--minimal fields).

We then go on
to show that the complete ghost propagators remain retarded
in one--loop dimensional regularization.
The retarded character of the full ghost propagators
allows us to establish an equivalence between the
quantum hamiltonian and lagrangian correlation functions.
We also argue that the ground state wave function $P$
has trivial ghost dependence, which provides a direct
connection to the Fokker--Planck equation
