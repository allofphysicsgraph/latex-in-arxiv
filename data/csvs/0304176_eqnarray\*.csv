The energy-momentum tensor corresponding to this metric has
diagonal form from which we observe that the source of this metric
possesses the following energy density and pressure:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\varepsilon &=& -\frac{-1 + r'^2 + 2rr''}{8\pi r^2},\allowdisplaybreaks \\
%-\fr {1}{8\pi}\left\{\fr {a^2}{(\rho^2 + a^2)^2} + \Lambda\right\}

%\fr {1}{8\pi}\left\{- \fr {a^2}{(\rho^2 +a^2)^2} + \Lambda\right\}
p_\theta &=& p_\varphi = \frac{r''}{8\pi r}.

In the paper we obtain general formulas for space-time
(\ref{Metric}) with arbitrary symmetric function $r(\rho)$ obeying
above Minkowskian condition. Two specific kinds of throat's
profile will be considered. In the first model the profile of
throat has the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{First}
r(\rho) = \sqrt{\rho^2 + a^2},
\end{equation}
where $a$ is radius of throat which characterizes wormhole's size.
The embedding into the three dimensional Euclidean space of the
section of the space-time by surface $t=const, \theta = \pi/2$ is
plotted in Fig.\ref{worms}(I) for two different values of radius
of throat. In Euclidean space with cylindrical coordinates
$(r,\varphi,z)$ this surface may be found in parametric form from
relations: $r=r(\rho),z'(\rho) = \sqrt{1-r'^2}$. In this
background there is the only nonzero component of the Ricci tensor
which reads

{\cal R}^\rho_\rho = -"
