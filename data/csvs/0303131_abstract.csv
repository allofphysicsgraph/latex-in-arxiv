We consider a dynamical brane world in a six dimensional spacetime
containing a singularity. Using the Israel conditions we study the
motion of a 4-brane embedded in this setup. We analize the brane
behavior when its position is perturbed about a fixed point and solve
the full non-linear  
dynamics in the several possible scenarios. We also investigate
the possible gravitational shortcuts and
calculate the delay between graviton and photon signals
and the ratio of the corresponding subtended horizons.
