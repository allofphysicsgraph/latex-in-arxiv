From the viewpoint of the singular quantum mechanics the effect of the 
energy-dependent coupling constant for $\delta$-function potential is 
examined. The energy-dependence of the coupling constant naturally generates
the time-derivative in the boundary condition of the Euclidean propagator.
This is explicitly confirmed by making use of the simple $1d$ model.
The result is applied to the linearized gravity fluctuation equation 
for the brane-world scenario with $4d$ induced gravity.  
Our approach generates $5d$ Newton potential at a certain intermediate
range of distance between two test massive sources. For other range of distance
$4d$ Newton potential is recovered.
