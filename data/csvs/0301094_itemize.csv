\item $Q^2 = 0$; {\it i.e.}, the BRST operator is nilpotent.  This
  identity relies on a cancellation between matter and ghost terms
  which only works in dimension $D = 26$ for the bosonic theory.
\item $\{Q, b_0\} = L_0^{({\rm m})} + L_0^{({\rm g})} -1$.
\item $Q$ has ghost number 1, so acting on a state $| s \rangle$ of
  ghost number $G$ gives a state $Q | s \rangle$ of ghost number $G
  + 1$.
\item The physical states of the theory are given by the cohomology of
  $Q$ at ghost number 1
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal H}_{{\rm phys}} & = & {\cal H}_{{\rm closed}}/{\cal H}_{{\rm
    exact}}
\nonumber\\
 & = & \{| \psi \rangle:Q | \psi \rangle = 0\}/
\left( | \psi \rangle \sim | \psi \rangle + Q | \chi \rangle \right)
\end{eqnarray}
\item Physical states can be chosen as representatives of each
  cohomology class so that they are all annihilated by $b_0$.

\item This model  satisfies all the axioms of string field
theory, and has a BRST operator with vanishing cohomology.  
\item
In the RSZ
model, the equation of motion factorizes into the usual equation of
motion
\begin{equation}
\hat{Q} \Psi_{\rm ghost} + g \Psi_{\rm ghost}\star\Psi_{\rm ghost} = 0
\label{eq:EOM-ghosts}
\end{equation}
for the ghost part of the field, and a projection equation
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\rm matter} =\Psi_{\rm matter} \star\Psi_{\rm matter} 
% % \label{eq:}
\end{equation}
for the matter part of the field, where the full string field is given
by
\begin{equation}
\Psi = \Psi_{\rm ghost} \otimes \Psi_{\rm matter} \,.
% % \label{eq:}
\end{equation}
Thus, finding a solution of the equation of motion reduces to the
problem of solving the equation of motion in the ghost sector and
identifying projection operators in the string field star algebra.
It was also recently shown \cite{Hata-Kawano,RSZ-closed,Okuyama} that by
taking the BRST operator $\hat{Q}$ to be given by a ghost insertion
localized at the string midpoint, the ghost equation also has
essentially the form of the projection equation.  Thus, this seems to
be a very natural choice for the BRST operator of the RSZ model.
\item
A number of projection operators have been identified in the string
field star algebra.  These projection operators have many of the
properties desired of D-branes.  We will briefly review some aspects of
these projection operators in the next subsection.
\item
Given the projection operators just mentioned, the ratio of 
tensions between D-branes of different dimensionality can be computed
and has the correct value \cite{RSZ-2}\footnote{
This result was known at the time of the lectures.
There was quite a bit
  of recent 
  work on the problem of computing the exact D-brane tension
  \cite{VSFT-tension}.   A very nice recent
  paper by Okawa \cite{Okawa} resolved the question and demonstrated that
  not only the ratio of tensions, but also the tension of an
  individual brane, is correctly reproduced in the RSZ VSFT theory
  when singularities are correctly controlled.}.
