We give a direct {\sc Lie} algebraic characterisation of conformal
inclusions of chiral current algebras associated with compact,
reductive {\sc Lie} algebras. We use straightforward quantum field
theoretic arguments and prove a long standing conjecture of
Schellekens and Warner on grounds of unitarity and positivity
of energy. We explore the structures found to characterise
``conformal covariance subalgebras'' and ``coset current
algebras''.
