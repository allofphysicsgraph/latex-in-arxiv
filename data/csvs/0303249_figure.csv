 \caption{The two slicings of $AdS_5$. The horizontal axis is the
direction $x$ transverse to the brane and the vertical axis is the radial
direction of $AdS$ interpolating from the boundary (solid line) to the
horizon (dashed line).  The figure on the left shows lines of constant $\rho$
while the figure on the right shows lines of constant $r$.}

$\vev{{\cal O}_4 {\cal O}_4}$. The circle
 represents the boundary of $AdS_5$, where we insert the operators,
 and the vertical straight line crossing it represents the $AdS_4$ brane.
The other solid lines are bulk scalar propagators, and the curly line is
a brane scalar propagator.}
