\item Both Hamiltonians and states are easily mapped between
string and field theory.

\item Part of the world-sheet reparametrization invariance of string theory
corresponds to the freedom to define different continuum limits in
the field theory.

\item The field theory Hamiltonian provides a discretization of
the string theory Hamiltonian. For states with a large number of
particles, the jagged string world-sheet is a good approximation.

\item By checking the closure of the Lorentz algebra in string
theory, one finds that there is no critical dimension. This is in
natural correspondence with the fact that free field theories
exist in any number of spacetime dimensions.

\item The spectrum of the string Hamiltonian does not contain a tachyon,
naturally reflecting the stability of the field theory.

\item Adding mass $m$ to the scalar particles corresponds to
imposing a hard cutoff equal to $2\pi/m$ 
in the warped direction of the Poincare
patch. This is very similar to the standard (super)gravity
construction of confining gauge theories (in the large 't~Hooft
coupling limit of the AdS/CFT correspondence). Mode number in
the bulk maps to particle number on the boundary.

\item The large $N$ expansion in the field theory (which in the absence of
interactions becomes just the combinatorics of organizing Wick
contractions) is mapped to the ``genus expansion'' in string theory.
