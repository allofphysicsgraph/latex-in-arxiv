We study a six dimensional braneworld model in the case where the four
dimensional brane is described by a topologically stable vortex of a
U(1) symmetry-breaking Abelian Higgs model. We revisit the range of
the microscopic parameters that leads to gravity confinement on the
brane. In particular, we find that the necessary fine-tuning is much
tighter than previously though, and qualitatively different from that
of a five dimensional braneworld with a brane described by a domain
wall. The investigation of gauge invariant perturbations around this
background solution reveals that, contrary to the five dimensional
case, there exist perturbation modes which can only satisfy the
boundary condition of being bounded far from the brane provided they
are tachyonic inside the brane. The warped space-time structure that
is obtained this way is thus unstable. The genericness of our
conclusions is discussed; this will shed some light on the possibility
of describing our spacetime as a general six dimensional braneworld.
