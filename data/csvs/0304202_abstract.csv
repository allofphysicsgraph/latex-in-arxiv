The anomalous Ward identity is derived for $N = 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills 
theories
, which is resulted out of Wrapping of $D_5$ branes on Supersymmetric two 
cycles.
From the Ward identity One obtains the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde
equation and hence can solve for the pre-potential. This way one avoids 
the
problem of enhancon which maligns the non-perturbative behaviour of the 
Yang-Mills
theory resulted out of Wrapped branes.
