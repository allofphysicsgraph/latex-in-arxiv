We show that the string bit model suffers from doubling in the
fermionic sector. The doubling leads to strong violation of
supersymmetry in the limit $N\to\infty$. Since there is an exact
correspondence between string bits and the algebra of BMN
operators even at finite $N$, doubling is expected also on the
side of super-Yang--Mills theory. We discuss the origin of the
doubling in the BMN sector.
