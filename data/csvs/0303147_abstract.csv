Regularization of quantum field theories introduces a mass scale
which breaks axial rotational and scaling invariances. We
demonstrate from first principles that axial torsion and torsion
trace modes have non-transverse vacuum polarization tensors, and
become massive as a result.
%%%!!!
The underlying reasons are similar to those responsible for the
Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) and scaling anomalies.

Since these are the only torsion components that can couple minimally to spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles, the
anomalous generation of masses for these modes, naturally of the order of the regulator scale, may help to
explain why torsion and its associated effects, including CPT violation in chiral gravity, have so far escaped
detection. As a simpler manifestation of the reasons underpinning the ABJ anomaly than triangle diagrams, the
vacuum polarization demonstration is also pedagogically useful. In addition it is shown that the teleparallel
limit of a Weyl fermion theory coupled only to the left-handed spin connection leads to a counter term which is
the Samuel-Jacobson-Smolin action of chiral gravity in four dimensions.
