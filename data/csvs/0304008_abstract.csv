The quantum vacuum effects are investigated for a massive scalar
field with general curvature coupling and obeying the Robin
boundary conditions given on two concentric spherical shells with
radii $a $ and $b$ in the $D+1$-dimensional global monopole
background. The expressions are derived for the Wightman function,
the vacuum expectation values of the field square, the vacuum
energy density, radial and azimuthal stress components in the
region between the shells. A regularization procedure is carried
out by making use of the generalized Abel-Plana formula for the
series over zeros of combinations of the cylinder functions. This
formula allows us to extract from the vacuum expectation values
the parts due to a single sphere on background of the global
monopole gravitational field, and to present the ""interference""
parts in terms of exponentially convergent integrals, useful, in
particular, for numerical evaluations. The vacuum forces acting on
the boundaries are presented as a sum of the self--action and
interaction terms. The first one contains well known surface
divergences and needs a further regularization. The interaction
forces between the spheres are finite for all values $a<b$ and are
attractive for a Dirichlet scalar. The asymptotic behavior of the
vacuum densities is investigated (i) in the limits $a\to 0$ and
$b\to \infty $, (ii) in the limit $a,b\to \infty $ for fixed value
$b-a$, and (iii) for small values of the parameter associated with
the solid angle deficit in global monopole geometry. We show that
in the case (ii) the results for two parallel Robin plates on the
Minkowski bulk are rederived to the leading order.
