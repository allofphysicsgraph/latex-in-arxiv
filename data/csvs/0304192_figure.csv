which has the interpretation of the field produced by an infinite array of $\delta$-function
sources  (`D-branes') located at  $X = n(a+\frac12)$ .
The dashed line represents the analytic continuation to $|X| > \frac{a}{2}$
of the  branch around the origin. }\"

\caption{Integration contours in the complex $P$ plane.
 The zeros of $\sin(a P/2)$ are denoted by the symbols `$x$'
along the real $P$ axis. The black dots represent possible poles
of $\widetilde{A}$ and the thick line represents a possible cut.
We assume that the only singularities of $\widetilde A$ are on the
imaginary $P$ axis.}

\caption{ Before the double Wick rotation
%application of the master formula \refb{disc},
 we have a standard disk amplitude. The disk can be viewed
as the region ${\cal H}_\rho$, which is the complex plane with
 a hole of radius $\rho$.  There are contributions to the scattering amplitude from all values of
$\rho \leq \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the distance of the closest
puncture. After the double Wick rotation
 %application of \refb{disc},
 the only contribution is coming
from $\rho=0$. The hole shrinks  to a point leaving behind an
extra puncture ${\cal W}$ inserted at the origin.}
