We present an approach to the construction of Action Principles for first
order (in time derivatives) differential equations (the inverse problem of
the Calculus of Variations) and generalize it to field theory in order to
construct systematically, for integrable equations which are based on the
existence of a Nijenhuis (or hereditary) operator, a ladder of Action
Principles which is complementary to the well--known multi--Hamiltonian
formulation. We work out results for the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV)
equation, which is a member of the positive hierarchy related to the
hereditary operator. Three negative hierarchies of (negative) evolution
equations are defined naturally from the hereditary operator as well, in a
concise way, suitable for field theory. We identify the Liouville,
Sinh--Gordon, Hunter--Zheng and Camassa--Holm equations as negative ones.
The same multi--Lagrangian scheme for KdV is shown to apply also to these
and other positive and negative evolution equations. The Euler--Lagrange
equations arising from the Action Principles are equivalent to
deformations of the original evolution equation, and the deformations are
obtained explicitly in terms of the positive and negative evolution
vectors, which follows from the factorized hereditary operator. For
example, several nonequivalent, nonlocal Action Principles for KdV which
are time--reparametrization invariant are constructed, and a new Action
Principle for the deformed system Sinh--Gordon $+$ spatial translation
vector is presented. The factorized hereditary operator allows for the
explicit computation of local and nonlocal Hamiltonian operators, as the
inverses of all the nonequivalent symplectic $2$--forms in the ladder.
Nonlocal constants of the motion are constructed for KdV as well as for
positive and negative vectors, in a concise way. Alternative Lax pairs for
all negative vectors are constructed. Some results are mapped to the
Krichever--Novikov and Harry--Dym equations.
