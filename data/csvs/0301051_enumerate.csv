\item[(a)] All of the terms within a characteristic equation are all of degree
$d$. For example:
\begin{equation}
    F^{12},\,\,\,T_2T_4F^6,\,\,\,T_4F^8,\,\,\,T_2T_4T_6,\,\,\,\mbox{etc.}
\end{equation}
are all of degree 12.
\item[(b)] Each characteristic equation has one fieldstrength tensor of
degree $D$, say for $D=d$, the relevant tensor is $F^d$. See
example in (a).
\item[(c)]  With $T_{j}=\mbox{Tr}(F^j)$, the rest
of the terms in each characteristic equation are products of the
form $\prod_kT_{j_k}$ where $j=j_k$ is even only and that $\sum_k
j_k =d$ is also even. The subscript here initially is set to
$j=d$. See example in (a).
\item[(d)] These are only formed when the
degree is even also. It is not constructed when the degree is odd.
The following are all of degree 13,
\begin{equation}
    F^{13},\,\,\,T_2T_4F^7,\,\,\,T_4F^9,\,\,\,T_2T_4T_6F,\,\,\,\mbox{etc.}
\end{equation}
which is Example in (a) times $F$.
\item[(e)] Each term formed in steps (c)-(d) has a prefactor
$(-1)^t\frac{1}{1!j^1}$ with $j$ and $d$ defined in (c). This is
applied only when $j_k$ in (c) is unique. Here $t$ denotes the
degree of $T$.
\item[(f)] If in $\prod_kT_{j_k}$, $j_{k}$ is not unique (i.e.
$j_{k}$ appeared as a subscript $p$ times) the term formed in step
(e) will have a prefactor $(-1)^t\frac{1}{p!j^p}$. It can be a
product $(-1)^d\prod_{q}\frac{1}{(p_q)!j^{p_q}}$ for every $q$th
$T_j$ term that appeared $p_q$ times. It should be noted that
$T_2T_2T_2$ will have a different prefactor with $T^3_2$. And that
the latter expression should be used.
\item[(g)]
Characteristic equations whose common degree is odd is simply the
even degree characteristic equation (obtained from steps (a)-(c))
with all terms unit $F$ multiplied.
\item[(h)] All terms in a characteristic equation whose degree $d+1$ is odd
are all carried to $d+2$ characteristic equation except that $F$
is multiplied to each term. The additional degree is contributed
by this unit $F$ multiplication. Since $d+2$ is again even, steps
(c)-(f) is repeated.
\item[(i)] All terms formed in the above steps are added after following
strictly the constraints provided in each step as in (\ref{fn}) or
equivalently (\ref{fv}) or (\ref{fd}). These terms comprise the
characteristic equation of $F^n$ true only when $F$ is abelian.
