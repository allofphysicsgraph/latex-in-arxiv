\title{Galois currents and the projective kernel in Rational Conformal Field
Theory}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The notion of Galois currents in Rational Conformal Field Theory is
introduced and illustrated on simple examples. This leads to a natural
partition of all theories into two classes, depending on the existence
of a non-trivial Galois current. As an application, the projective
kernel of a RCFT, i.e. the set of all modular transformations represented
by scalar multiples of the identity, is described in terms of a small
set of easily computable invariants.

\section{Introduction}

A most important characteristic of a (Rational) Conformal Field Theory
is the associated modular representation \cite{Cardy}. Not only does
it prescribe the transformation of the genus one characters of the
primary fields under the modular group $\Gamma\left(1\right)=SL\left(2,\mathbb{Z}\right)$,
but it does also determine the central charge (modulo 8), the fractional
part of the conformal weights, the fusion rules via Verlinde's formula,
etc.\cite{Ver,MS}. All these properties are linked to the fact that
the modular representation of an RCFT provides part of the defining
data of a modular tensor category \cite{Turaev,MTC,FRS}. 

A fundamental property of the modular representation, conjectured
by many authors over the years \cite{Moore,Eholzer,Eh-Sko,BCIR,CG2}
and finally proved in \cite{CMP}, is the congruence subgroup property:
there exists a natural number $N$ (which turns out to equal the
order of the matrix $T$ representing the Dehn-twist $\tau\mapsto\tau+1$),
such that the kernel of the modular representation contains the principal
congruence subgroup \[
\Gamma\left(N\right)=\left\{  \left(\begcc\, |\, cc\right\}  
a & b\\
c & d\end{array}\right)\in\Gamma\left(1\right)}{a,d\equiv1\, \left(\mathrm{mod}\, \, N,\,\,b,c\equiv0\, \left(\mathrm{mod}\, \, N}\,.\]
In other words all modular transformations which belong to $\Gamma\left(N\right)$
are represented by the identity. This result has far reaching implications
both in theory and practice, e.g. it is the basis of powerful algorithms
to compute arbitrary modular matrices. 

Once we know that the kernel is a congruence subgroup, we can look
for a complete description of it in terms of a small set of easy-to-compute
invariants. As it turns out, this won't work for the kernel, but the
reason is that the kernel is not the right notion to look at. It is
the projective kernel, i.e. the set of modular transformations represented
by scalar matrices, that is the natural object, and for it one does
indeed get a simple description. Along the way emerges the notion
of Galois currents, which are simple currents \cite{sc1,sc2,sc3}
related to the Galois action \cite{BG,CG1}. The basic result about
Galois currents is uniqueness: a model can have at most one non-trivial
Galois current. This leads at once to the partition of all RCFTs into
two classes, according to whether they have a non-trivial Galois current
or not. As we shall see, while the latter are the generic ones, many
important examples of RCFTs - like the Ising model - fall into the
first class. 

This paper aims to give a brief survey of the above results, concentrating
on the conceptual issues, and leaving the technical details to a separate
publication. Besides introducing the relevant notions and stating
the main results, a couple of simple examples are included in order
to illustrate the general theory. 


\section{Modular matrices and the Galois action}

As indicated in the introduction, to each rational CFT is associated
a finite dimensional representation $D$ of the modular group $\Gamma\left(1\right)$.
This representation is most conveniently described by a pair of matrices
$S$ and $T$, which represent the generators $\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1\\
1 & 0\end{array}\right)$ and $\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
0 & 1\end{array}\right)$ of the modular group. These matrices have to satisfy the defining
relations \begin{eqnarray*}
STS & = & T^{-1}ST^{-1}\,,\\
S^{4} & = & 1\end{eqnarray*}
of the modular group. It should be noted that the matrices $S$ and
$T$ carry much more information than a mere linear representation
of $\Gamma\left(1\right)$, for the individual matrix elements have
an invariant meaning in themselves, in other words the representation
comes equipped with a distinguished basis formed by the genus 1 characters
of the primary fields. The properties of the matrix elements with
respect to this distinguished basis are summarized in Verlinde's theorem
\cite{Ver,MS}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The matrix $T$ is diagonal and of finite order;
\item The matrix $S$ is symmetric;
\item The fusion rules of the primaries are given by Verlinde's formula
\[
N_{pqr}=\sum_{s}\frac{S_{p}^{s}S_{q}^{s}S_{r}^{s}}{S_{0}^{s}}\,,\]
where $0$ labels the vacuum (the conformal block of the identity).
\end{enumerate}
One may show that the modular representation is quite special in many
respects, the basic result being the congruence subgroup property
mentioned in the introduction, i.e. that the kernel $\ker D$ of the
modular representation is a congruence subgroup of level $N$
\cite{CMP}. One may also show that the \emph{conductor} $N$,
which is equal to the order of the matrix $T$, is bounded by a universal
function of the dimension (= number of primary fields). Moreover,
if we denote by $K$ the projective order of $T$, i.e. the smallest
positive integer such that $T^{K}$ is a scalar matrix, then the integer
$e=\frac{N}{K}$ is a divisor of $12$ \cite{CMP}. The integers
$e$ and $K$ are important characteristics of the model.

Because the individual matrix elements have an invariant meaning,
it is meaningful to look at their arithmetic properties, which is
the content of the theory of the Galois action \cite{BG,CG1}. The
basic idea is to look at the field $F$ obtained by adjoining to the
rationals the matrix elements of all modular matrices (it is enough
to adjoin those of the generators $S$ and $T$). It turns out that
the field $F$ equals the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}\left[ \zeta_{N\right] }$, where $N$
is the conductor of the model. By a well known result of algebraic
number theory, the Galois group of the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}\left[ \zeta_{N\right] }$
over $\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the group $\mathcal{G}_{N}=\left(\mathbb{Z}/NZ\right)^{*}$
of prime residues modulo $N$, where to the prime residue $l\in\mathcal{G}_{N}$
corresponds the map $\sigma_{l}$ sending $\zeta_{N}$ to its
$l$-th power $\zeta_{N}^{l}$. As $\sigma_{l}$ maps $F$ into
itself, it is meaningful to consider its action on the matrix elements
of $S$ and $T$. The basic result \cite{BG,CG1}, which follows from
Verlinde's theorem, is \[
\sigma_{l}\left(S_{q}^{p}\right)=\varepsilon_{l}\left(q\right)S_{\pi_{l}q}^{p}\,,\]
where $\pi_{l}$ is a permutation of the primaries - the \emph{Galois
permutation} associated to $l\in\mathcal{G}_{N}$ -, while $\varepsilon_{l}\left(q\right)=\pm1$
is a sign. The above Galois permutations define a permutation action
of $\mathcal{G}_{N}$ on the set of primaries, because they satisfy $\pi_{lm}=\pi_{l}\pi_{m}$.


\section{Galois currents}

According to the traditional definition \cite{sc1,sc2,sc3}, a simple
current is a primary field $\alpha$ whose quantum dimension is $1$,
i.e. such that $S_{0}^{\alpha}=S_{0}^{0}$. From this definition follows
that the fusion product of a simple current $\alpha$ with a primary
$p$ is again a primary field, denoted $\alpha p$, i.e. simple currents
induce permutations of the primaries. Of course, the permutations
arising this way are quite special, and it is a challenging problem
to characterize those permutation groups that may correspond to the
action of simple currents on the primary fields of some RCFT. In any
case, this induced permutation action allows us to consider for each
simple current $\alpha$ the set \[
L_{\alpha}="
