\item[(a)] For a primitive $p^r$ with $r\ge 1$,
\begin{equation}
T_{p^r}T_p \psi(\tau)=T_{p^{r+1}}\psi(\tau)+p^{-13}T_{p^{r-1}}\psi(\tau).
\end{equation}
Hence $T_{p^r}$ is a polynomial in $T_p$ with integer coefficients.
\item[(b)]
\begin{equation}
T_m T_n \psi(\tau)=T_{mn}\psi(\tau)
\end{equation}
if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.
\item[(c)] The algebra generated by the $T_n$ for $n=1,2,3,\ldots $
is generated by the $T_p$ with $p$ prime and is commutative.
