We study nonsingular cosmological scenarios in a general $D$-dimensional 
string effective action of the dilaton-modulus-axion system in the presence 
of the matter source.  In the standard dilatonic Brans-Dicke parameter 
($\omega=-1$) with radiation, we analytically obtain singularity-free 
bouncing solutions where the universe starts out in a state with a finite 
curvature and evolves toward the weakly coupled regime.  We apply this 
analytic method to the string-gas cosmology including the massive state in 
addition to the leading massless state (radiation), with and without 
the axion.  We numerically find bouncing solutions which asymptotically 
approach an almost radiation-dominant universe with a decreasing curvature 
irrespective of the presence of the axion, implying that inclusion of the 
matter source is crucial for the existence of such solutions for 
$\omega=-1$.  In the theories with $\omega \ne -1$, it is possible to 
obtain complete regular bouncing solutions with a finite dilaton and 
curvature in both past and future asymptotics for the general dimension, 
$D$.  We also discuss the case where dilatonic higher-order corrections are 
involved to the tree-level effective action and demonstrate that the 
presence of axion/modulus fields and the matter source does not 
significantly affect the dynamics of the dilaton-driven inflation and the 
subsequent graceful exit.
