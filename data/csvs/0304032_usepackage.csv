\abstract{We compute the meson spectrum of an $\mbox{${\cal N}$}=2$ super
Yang-Mills theory with fundamental matter from its dual string 
theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ with a D7-brane probe \cite{KK02}. 
For scalar and vector mesons with arbitrary R-charge the spectrum 
is computed in closed form by solving the equations for D7-brane 
fluctuations; for matter with non-zero mass $m_q$ it is discrete, 
exhibits a mass gap of order $m_q/\sqrt{g_s N}$ and furnishes 
representations of $SO(5)$ even though the manifest global symmetry 
of the theory is only $SO(4)$. The spectrum of mesons with large 
spin $J$ is obtained from semiclassical rotating open strings attached 
to the D7-brane. It displays Regge-like behaviour for $J\ll\ensuremath{\sqrt{g_s N}}$, whereas
for  $J\gg\ensuremath{\sqrt{g_s N}}$ it corresponds to that of two non-relativistic quarks 
bound by a Coulomb potential. Meson interactions, baryons and `giant
gauge bosons' are briefly discussed.}

\section{Introduction} \label{intro}

The best-understood example of the AdS/CFT correspondence 
\cite{Maldacena97,GKP98,Witten98} (see \cite{AGMOO99} for a
review) is the duality between IIB string theory on \mbox{$AdS_{5}\times {S}^{5}$} 
and $\mbox{${\cal N}$} =4$ \ensuremath{{SU(N)}}  super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, which can be
motivated by analyzing the low-energy dynamics of a stack of $N$ 
D3-branes \cite{Maldacena97} in Minkowski space. All matter fields in 
the gauge theory are in the adjoint representation. Of course, one can
study the response of the theory to {\it external} sources in the
fundamental representation by computing, for example, the Wilson
loop. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, this was done in 
\cite{Maldacena98} by studying a string with endpoints attached to the 
AdS boundary.

It was noted in \cite{KK02} that by introducing $k$ D7-branes into
\mbox{$AdS_{5}\times {S}^{5}$}, $k$ flavours of {\it dynamical} quarks (or, more precisely, 
$k$ fundamental hypermultiplets) can be added to the gauge theory, 
breaking the supersymmetry to $\mbox{${\cal N}$}=2$. 
This can be understood by starting 
with a stack of $N$ D3-branes and $k$ parallel D7-branes in 
Minkowski space, which we represent by the array
