and not $f(\vec k,\pm)=j(\vec k,\pm)$ which would have occured in the irreducible formalism. The difference is subtle but of crucial importance since the property $\chi(0)=0$ can regularize the infrared divergence. In the irreducible case the radiation field produced by an accelerated pointlike charge involves the amplitude 
$j(\vec k,\pm)$ which instead of vanishing blows up at $\vec k=0$. In the reducible case we obtain a regularization which eliminates the infrared divergence if the vacuum 
$\tilde O(\vec k)$ is correctly chosen. The same concerns the average number of photons of the radiated field \cite{II,III}. Let us mention that the operators 
$\underline{I}_{\vec k}$ appear also in reducibly quantized solutions of Maxwell equations with classical currents and thus regularize classical divergences. 

To conclude, the reducible representations seem to produce the cut-off functions in exactly those places one expects them to occur. This is a consequence of the RHS of CAR and CCR where instead of identities one finds $\underline{I}_{\vec p}$ and $\underline{I}_{\vec k}$. At the level of amplitudes and in thermodynamic limits one finds the effective rule $\underline{I}_{\vec p}\to Z \chi(\vec p)$, 
$\underline{I}_{\vec k}\to \tilde Z \tilde \chi(\vec p)$. The analogy to  renormalized fields\footnote{I am indebted to prof. H. Grosse for drawing my attention to this point during our discussion in Bia{\l}owie\.za}
whose CAR and CCR relations involve at RHS the renormalization constants $Z_2$ and $Z_3$ supplemented by cut-offs is probably not accidental. An argument in favor of our approach is that the RHS of CAR and CCR are Poincar\'e covariant \cite{II,IV} since 
$U_{\Lambda,y}^{-1}\underline{I}_{\vec p}U_{\Lambda,y}=
\underline{I}_{\overrightarrow{\Lambda^{-1} p}}$, 
$U_{\Lambda,y}^{-1}\underline{I}_{\vec k}U_{\Lambda,y}=
\underline{I}_{\overrightarrow{\Lambda^{-1} k}}$, which would not be possible if 
$\underline{I}_{\vec p}$ and $\underline{I}_{\vec k}$ were simply replaced in CAR and CCR by the functions 
$Z \chi(\vec p)$ and
$\tilde Z \tilde \chi(\vec p)$.
Our theory is nonlocal \cite{Efimov} but in an unusual sense.

The above representations have a status of toy models. The main message we have tried to convey is that reducibility of some type may be crucial for a consistent QFT, a viewpoint advocated also by Dirac in his last paper \cite{Dirac}. Generalizations to more abstract formalisms may be essential for the issue of gauge invariance, which is beyond our reach at the moment.  
In this context let us note the recent paper \cite{Jan} where a similar representation of CCR is discussed at the level of correlation-function approach to photons.
