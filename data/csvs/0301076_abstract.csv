We study Born-Infeld type effective action for unstable D3-brane system
including a tachyon and an Abelian gauge field, and find the rolling tachyon
with constant electric and magnetic fields as the most general homogeneous 
solution. Tachyonic vacua are characterized by magnitudes of the electric 
and magnetic fields and the angle between them. Analysis of small 
fluctuations in this background shows that the obtained configuration may be
interpreted as a fluid consisting of string-like objects carrying electric
and magnetic fields. They are stretched along one direction and 
the rolling tachyon move in a perpendicular direction to the strings. 
Direction of the propagating waves coincides with that of strings with 
velocity equal to electric field.
