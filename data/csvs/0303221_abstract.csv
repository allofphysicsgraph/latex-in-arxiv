Liouville theory with a negative norm boson and no screening
charge corresponds to an exact classical solution of closed
bosonic string theory describing time-dependent bulk tachyon
condensation. A simple expression for the two point function is
proposed based on renormalization/analytic continuation of the
known results for the ordinary (positive-norm) Liouville theory.
The expression agrees exactly with the minisuperspace result for
the closed string pair-production rate (which diverges at finite
time). Puzzles concerning the three-point function are presented
and discussed.
