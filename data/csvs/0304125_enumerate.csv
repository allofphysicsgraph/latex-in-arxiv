\item The first line accounts for the zero-point energy of the
quantum kink measured with respect to the zero-point energy of the
vacuum. Eigenstates from both the discrete and continuous spectrum
of ${\cal K}_{aa}$ contribute. The higher bound state contributes
with a weight $s_{l}$, which is 1 if $\omega_{l}$ does not
coincide with the bottom of the continuous spectrum (threshold).
If $\omega_{l}$ is buried at threshold, the corresponding
eigenstate is a half-bound state and $s_{l}=\frac{1}{2}$. To
deduce formula (\ref{eq:dhn}) the density of states in the
continuous spectrum is given in terms of the phase shifts
$\delta_a(q)$ of the scattering waves through the potential:
$v_a^2-V_{aa}(x)$. A cut-off in the number of modes ( see Appendix
for a complete derivation of formula (\ref{eq:dhn}) including the
case of potentials with non-zero reflection coefficients) has been
used for renormalizing the zero point energy. Note also that the
subtraction of $\frac{v_a}{2}$ amounts to neglecting the
contribution of the half-bound state on the vacuum to the vacuum
zero-point energy \cite{Graham}.
\item The second line takes into account the contribution of
the mass renormalization counter-term to the Casimir energies of
both the kink and the vacuum.

\item Spectrum of ${\cal V}$

\begin{itemize}

\item Odd eigenfunctions

If $n^-$ is a natural number and the wave vectors $k_{n^-}$
satisfy
\[
k_{n^-}\cdot L=\pi n^- \hspace{1cm},\hspace{1cm} n^-\in {\Bbb
N}\qquad ,
\]
then the odd functions, $\psi_{n^-}(x)=-\psi_{n^-}(-x)$,
\[
\psi_{n^-}(x)=A_{n^-}\cdot {\rm sin}(k_{n^-}\cdot x)
\]
belong to the spectrum of ${\cal V}$ with eigenvalue
${\bar\omega}^2(k_{n^-})=k_{n^-}^2+v^2$. Since
$(k_{n^-+1}-k_{n^-})L=\pi$ the density of odd eigenstates is:
$\bar\rho^-(k)=\frac{L}{\pi}$.

\item Even eigenfunctions

If $n^+$ is a natural number and the wave vectors $k_{n^+}$
satisfy
\[
k_{n^+}\cdot L=\pi(n^++\textstyle\frac{1}{2}) \hspace{1cm} ,
\hspace{1cm} n^+\in {\Bbb N}\qquad ,
\]
then the even functions, $\psi_{n^+}(x)=\psi_{n^+}(-x)$,
\[
\psi_{n^+}(x)=A_{n^+}\cdot {\rm cos}(k_{n^+}\cdot x)
\]
belong to the spectrum of ${\cal V}$ with eigenvalue
${\bar\omega}^2(k_{n^+})=k_{n^+}^2+v^2$. Now,
$\bar\rho^+(k)=\frac{L}{\pi}$.

\end{itemize}


\item Spectrum of ${\cal K}$
\begin{itemize}
\item Bound states:

We assume that there exist $l$ bound states with $\omega^2\leq
v^2$. In particular we denote by $l^+$ the number of symmetric
bound states and by $l^-$ the number of antisymmetric states,
$l=l^+ + l^-$. If $\omega_{l}^2=v^2$, the highest bound state
becomes a half-bound one and contributes with a weight of
$s_{l}=\frac{1}{2}$ to the mass quantum correction.

\item Odd eigenfunctions.

There are odd eigenfunctions which asymptotically are of the form:
\[
\psi_{n^-}(x) \stackrel{x \rightarrow L}{\simeq} A_{n^-}\cdot{\rm
sin}[q_{n^-}\cdot x+\delta^-(q_{n^-})] \qquad .
\]
The odd phase shifts $\delta^-(q_{n^-})$ are defined in terms
of the transmission and reflection coefficients, see Section \S 3,
but now the boundary conditions require:
\begin{equation}
q_{n^-}\cdot L+\delta^-(q_{n^-})=\pi n^- \hspace{1cm},\hspace{1cm}
n^-\in {\Bbb N}\qquad . \label{eq:bouno}
\end{equation}
Unitarity, transparency at $q=\infty$, and, continuity of the wave
function at $q=0$ (threshold) allow us to set the phase ambiguity
as in \cite{Barton}:
\[
\lim_{q\rightarrow\infty}\delta^-(q)=0 \qquad , \qquad
\lim_{q\rightarrow 0^+}\delta^-(q)=\pi\l^- \qquad .
\]

The question arises: what is the minimum value $n^-=n_0^-$? For
very large $L$, $q_{n_0^-}$ is very small and (\ref{eq:bouno})
becomes:
\begin{equation}
q_{n_0^-}\cdot (L+\delta^{\prime -}(0^+))+\delta^-(0^+)=\pi
 n_0^- \qquad .
\end{equation}
Here, $\delta^{\prime -}(0^+)$ is the limit of the left-hand
derivative of the antisymmetric phase shift when $q$ goes to zero
from the right. The minimum value of $n^-=n_0^-$ is therefore
$n_0^-=l^-$. Since
$(q_{n^-+1}-q_{n^-})L+\delta^-(q_{n^-+1})-\delta(q_{n^-})=\pi$ the
density of antisymmetric states is:
\[
\rho^-(q)=\frac{L}{\pi}+\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\partial\delta^-(k)}{\partial
k}\qquad .
\]

\item Even eigenfunctions.

There are even eigenfunctions which asymptotically are of the
form:
\[
\psi_{n^+}(x)\stackrel{x \rightarrow L}{\simeq} A_{n^+}\cdot{\rm
cos}[q_{n^+}\cdot x+\delta^+(q_{n^+})] \qquad .
\]
The phase shifts $\delta^+(q_{n^+})$ are defined in terms of the
transmission and reflection coefficients, see Section \S 3, and
the boundary conditions require:
\begin{equation}
q_{n^+}\cdot L+\delta^+(q_{n^+})=\pi(n^++\textstyle\frac{1}{2})
\hspace{1cm},\hspace{1cm} n^+\in {\Bbb N}\qquad .
\end{equation}
Again we set the phase ambiguity by invoking Levinson's theorem as
in \cite{Barton}:
\[
\lim_{q\rightarrow\infty}\delta^+(q)=0 \qquad , \qquad
\lim_{q\rightarrow 0^+}\delta^+(q)=\pi(\l^+-\textstyle\frac{1}{2})
\]
where $l^+$ is the number of even bound states.

From
\[
q_{n_0^+}\cdot (L+\delta^{\prime +}(0^+))+\delta^+(0^+)=\pi
(n_0^++\textstyle\frac{1}{2}) \qquad ,
\]
we read the minimum possible value of $q_{n_0^+}$: $n_0^+=l^+$.
Now,
\[
\rho^+(q)=\frac{L}{\pi}+\frac{1}{\pi} \frac{\partial
\delta^+(k)}{\partial k}\qquad .
\]
We stress that due to the parity of the eigenfunctions there is no
need to consider negative values of $n^{\pm}$.
