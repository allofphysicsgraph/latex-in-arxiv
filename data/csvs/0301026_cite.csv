{bailey} of two variables, here $1-\rho$ and $\frac{1-\rho}{2}$, and
is equal to unity for $\rho=1$. Therefore, for the nut case in general
one has
\begin{equation}
S(\rho)=\frac{2^{n+1}}{(n+1)(1+\rho)^{n+1}}\,{\rm{Appell}}F_{1}[n+1,2,-n,n+2,1-\rho,\frac{1-\rho}{2}],\label{appel}
\end{equation}
which clearly has the value $\frac{1}{n+1}$ at the nut.

At the nut ($\rho=1$) one therefore has
\begin{equation}
\rho\left(\rho^{2}-1\right)S'(\rho)=0,
\end{equation}
One can verify by direct differentiation of Eq.({\ref{appel}}) that
$S'(\rho)$ has a factor $(\rho-1)$ in the denominator and the
numerator vanishes smoothly rendering the quantity
$\rho\left(\rho^{2}-1\right)S'(\rho)$ smooth at the nut and that it is
negative in general near the nut. In fact it is easier to see it in
the following way: at $\rho=1+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is an
arbitrarily small positive quantity,
$\rho\left(\rho^{2}-1\right)S'(\rho)$ cannot be positive (implying
that $S'(\rho)$ cannot be positive) because this would then mean an
increase in $S(\rho)$ which is not possible since this would make the
left hand side of Eq.({\ref{flow}}) negative definite. Therefore
$S'(\rho)$ has to be negative at $\rho=1$ and $S(\rho)$ must decrease.
Employing the same argument used for the bolt case $S(\rho)$ cannot
have a minimum and will decrease monotonically to approach zero
asymptotically. Therefore for any
$\frac{\beta^2}{\alpha^2}<\frac{1}{(1+n)}$ there will be an unique
infilling Taub-Nut metric. \,\,$\Box$

Note that, for the Taub-Nut solution, $r'_{b}=1$. For the bolt
solutions, no assumption has been made about the periodicity of $\tau$
as the lower limit $r'_{b}$ of the integral (i.e., the initial value
of $\rho$) has been kept arbitrary. The only property used was that
$r'_{b}>1$ which is a necessary condition for the existence of
bolts. The infilling bolts solutions will therefore be regular
solutions if the fibre-coordinate has a period $\frac{4\pi\,
p}{\lambda\,k}$.  The periodicity of the $\tau$ coordinate and the
base manifold is determined by specifying the boundary
$(\Sigma,h_{ij})$. If the periodicity of the fibre-coordinate is such
that $r'_{b}\ne p/k$, but $r'_{b}>1$, $\Sigma$ can still be filled in
with two positive definite bolt solutions although they will be
singular at the bolt. Our analysis above applies to such possibilities
as well. Also note that we do not require the base manifold to be
$\bbbc P^n$ for the Taub-Nut case, although otherwise the solutions
will be singular at the nut.  \\ \\ {\bf{Note 1}} The flow of
Eq.(\ref{flow}) is similar for all values of $k$ though they
correspond to different geometries. Even when $r'_{b} \ne p/k$, the
pattern is unchanged as long as $r'_{b}>1$, though the corresponding
solutions are singular at their bolt. However, as one varies $r'_{b}
(>1)$ and hits $r'_{b}=1$ the flow-pattern changes abruptly. This
singular, sudden shift in the flow of Eq.(\ref{flow}) at $r'_{b}=1$
encodes the change in the {\emph{topological}} character of the
infilling solutions.  \\ \\ {\bf{Note 2}} We have found a new closed
form expression for $\beta(r)$ for the Taub-Nut through the Appell
hypergeometric functions (cf Eq.({\ref{appel}})):
\begin{equation}
\beta(r)_{Nut}^2=\frac{\lambda\,c\,\,
2^{n}\,r\,(r-L)\,L^{n}}{(n+1)(r+L)^{n}}\,{\rm{Appell}}F_{1}[n+1,2,-n,n+2,1-\frac{r}{L},\frac{L-r}{2L}].\label{appel1}
\end{equation}
Note that this form explicitly shows how the ratio of $\beta(r)$ and
$\alpha(r)$ is non-zero at the nut, though they are separately zero.
%The corresponding expression for the Bolt-type solutions reads
%\begin{equation}
%\beta_{Bolt}^2=\frac{\lambda\,c\,\,r\,(r-r_{b})^{n+1}\,(r-r_{b}+2L)\,L^{n}%}{(n+1)(r^2-L^2)^{n}(1+\frac{r-r_{b}}{2L})^n}\,{\rm{Appell}}F_{1}[n+1,2,-n%,n+2,\frac{r_{b}-r}{L},\frac{r_{b}-r}{2L}].\label{appel2}
%\end{equation}
To our knowledge, the above form (\ref{appel1}) 
%and (\ref{appel2})
has not been found before. In terms of ordinary hypergeometric
functions the closed form expression for $\beta(r)_{Bolt}^2$ consists
of two terms, i.e., the difference of the function at the two limits
of the integral (\ref{betaint}) and hence is not particularly
illuminating.  \\ \\ 
{\bf{Comment 1}} Note that the boundary data for which there is an
infilling Taub-Nut solution is restricted by the squashing being less
than or equal to $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n+1}}$; beyond this there will be no
nut solution.  By setting $S'(\rho)=0$ the upper bound on the
squashing $S_{max}$ and the value of $\rho$ at which it occurs in the
case of Taub-Bolt can be found by solving Eq.(\ref{ratio1}) and
Eq.(\ref{flow}) simultaneously. Eliminating $S_{max}$, for example,
one needs to solve the following equation for $\rho$:
\begin{equation}
\left(\rho^{2}(2n+1)+1\right)\frac{2\rho}{(\rho^{2}-1)^{n+1}}
\int^{\rho}_{p/k}\frac{(s^{2}-1)^{n}}{s^{2}}ds-2=0, \label{highlim}
\end{equation} 
which, unfortunately, does not provide a simple expression for $\rho$
and consequently for $S_{max}$. However, following the previous
discussions, we know that there will be a unique positive solution to
Eq.(\ref{highlim}) which one can find for specific $n$ and $k$
numerically.  \\ \\
{\bf{Comment 2}} For a given boundary metric one can choose the
cosmological constant $\lambda$ for the base manifold arbitrarily. The
above calculations were carried out for $\lambda=2$. The statements on
the limits on squashing for the Taub-Nut and the Taub-Bolt are to be
understood in this light. Obviously the choice of $\lambda$ does not
affect the above arguments and one can always convert quantities from
one choice of $\lambda$ to another by basic algebraic
manipulations. The limits of squashing for $\lambda'$, for example,
are obtained from those for $\lambda$ by multiplying by
$\lambda'/\lambda$.
\subsection{On-shell action}
Before closing this section note that the on-shell action for any
infilling solution $({\cal{M}},g_{\mu\nu})$ is \cite{GHsur}:
\begin{equation}
I_{E}=-\frac{1}{8\pi G}\int_{\partial{\cal{M}}} d^{n}x\,\sqrt{h}K \label{on-shell}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the trace of the second fundamental form
$K_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial h_{ij}}{\partial\hat{n}}$ and $h_{ij}$ is
the metric of the boundary and $\hat{n}$ is the outward unit
normal\footnote{Note that in this convention the outward normal on
the boundary is positive.}. The bulk contribution vanishes so only the
boundary term contributes. Thus the boundary term plays a vital role
in the Euclidean approach to quantum gravity as was noted in
\cite{GHsur}. An analogous boundary term first appeared in the $3+1$
formulation in \cite{York-sur} and also in \cite{Regge1, Regge2}. For
a detailed discussion of the structure of the boundary term see
\cite{Charap}. 
\section{Black Holes in a Cavity of Arbitrary Dimension}
In this section we discuss finding solutions to the infilling
geometries for Schwarzschild in arbitrary dimension for arbitrary
boundary data $(\alpha,\beta)$. As mentioned earlier, the periodic
boundary conditions have the natural thermodynamic interpretation of a
spherical cavity immersed in a heat bath with temperature proportional
to the inverse of the radius of the fibre. As we will see below, it is
possible to find exact solutions for the two infilling Schwarzschild
geometries as analytic functions of the boundary data, or their
squashing to be more specific, in all dimensions.
 
To find the infilling geometries in $(n+1)$ dimensions, we need to
solve the analogue of Eq.(\ref{eqM}) obtained via the method used for
four dimensions:
\begin{equation}
C^{n}-\alpha^{(n-2)}C^{2}+\frac{1}{4}\alpha^{(n-2)}(n-2)^{2}\beta^{2}=0
\label{eqC},
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ has been replaced by $C^{n-2}$ for notational convenience.
As this is an equation in $C^{2}$ in odd dimensions, exact
Schwarzschild infilling solutions can be found immediately for
dimension five:
\begin{equation}
C_{\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{\alpha (\alpha \pm
\sqrt{\alpha^{2}-4\beta^{2}})}\label{mas}
\end{equation}
giving the two masses
\begin{equation}
M_{\pm}=\frac{3}{16}\,\pi\alpha (\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^{2}-4\beta^{2}}).
\end{equation}
The condition on squashing is then
\begin{equation}
\frac{\beta^{2}}{\alpha^{2}} \le \frac{1}{2},
\end{equation}
and is in agreement with Eq.(\ref{sqsh}). 

Similarly, explicit solutions can be found in seven and nine
dimensions as functions of the boundary data by means of ordinary
methods. In the case of four dimensions, we already know the solutions
from the work of York \cite {York1}. In dimensions other than these,
the degree of (\ref{mas}) is five and above. Explicit solutions are
therefore not obtainable in general in terms of radicals, as we know
from Galois theory. However, as will be shown below, exact {{\it
analytic}} solutions are still possible. They involve techniques less
well-known to the physics community and hence probably were not found
before.

For convenience, we rewrite Eq.(\ref{eqC}) in the following form:
\begin{equation}
x^{n}-x^{2}+ p=0 \label{refeq},
\end{equation}
where $x \equiv C/\alpha$ and $p
=\frac{(n-2)^{2}}{4}\frac{\beta^{2}}{\alpha^{2}}$. Note that
$p$ can be positive only for $0\le x \le 1$. This is because $x$ here is just the inverse of $\rho$ in
Eq.(\ref{sqsh}). 

By the fundamental theorem of algebra, Eq.(\ref{refeq}) will always
admit $n$ complex solutions. As we have seen, two of these will be
positive as long as the squashing does not exceed the value given by
Eq.(\ref{sqsh}) which translates into the following requirement for
Eq.(\ref{refeq}):
\begin{equation}
p \le \left(\frac{2}{n}\right)^\frac{2}{n-2}\left(1 -\frac{2}{n}\right)\label{psqsh}.\label{4.6}
\end{equation}
The existence of two positive roots can be reproduced from purely
algebraic arguments. For $n$ odd, there will be at least one real root
which will be negative as the product of all roots, $(-1)^{n}\, p$, is
negative. Remembering Descartes rule of changes of sign (see, for
example, \cite{BC}), there will be either two other positive roots
(double roots counted twice) or no positive roots -- meaning all other
roots are complex. For $n$ even there can be up to two positive and
two negative roots while the rest are complex; the positivity of
$(-1)^{n}\,p$ in this case excludes the possibility of having one
positive root and one negative root. So there will be either two
positive solutions or no positive solutions for $C$ depending on the
value of $p$.
\subsection{Solutions}
The problem at hand is to find the $n$ solutions of Eq.(\ref{refeq})
and identify the two positive roots which are bound to exist for $p$
obeying (\ref{psqsh}). Things are much simpler than the general $n$-th
degree equations as Eq.(\ref{refeq}) belongs to the class of equations
\begin{equation}
x^{n}-a\,x^s+b=0 \,\,\,\, (n>s) \label{trinom},
\end{equation}
known commonly as trinomial equations. Trinomial equations have a long
history, and was studied by mathematicians starting from Lambert to
Ramanujan in both their general and restricted forms in parallel with
the general equation of degree $n$. An elaborate historical account
can be found in \cite{Bela}. A major success came with the work of
Birkeland in $1927$ which showed that the $n$-roots of the general
equation of degree $n$ can be expressed as linear combinations of
higher order hypergeometric functions of several variables
\cite{Birkeland}. As a special case to the general equation of degree
$n$, he showed that the general trinomial equation of degree $n$ with
arbitrary complex coefficients can be solved exactly in terms of
hypergeometric functions of order $n$ of {\it{one}} variable. We have
discussed the general solutions in detail in the Appendix. As far as
we know, there is no substantial reference to the general solutions of
trinomial equations in the literature available in English.

As in the Appendix, the general solutions of (\ref{trinom}) are given
 in terms of the variable
\begin{equation}
\zeta=\frac{n^{n}}{s^s(n-s)^{n-s}}\frac{b^{n-s}}{a^{n}}.
\end{equation}
The solutions fall into two separate sectors corresponding to
$|\zeta|<1$ and $|\zeta|>1$. The two sectors have different analytic
forms of solutions in terms of hypergeometric functions.  In our case,
$a=1$, $s=2$, $b=p$ and hence
\begin{equation}
\zeta=\frac{n^{n}}{4(n-2)^{n-2}}\,p^{n-2}. \label{com}
\end{equation}
Since $p=\frac{(n-2)^{2}}{4}\frac{\beta^{2}}{\alpha^{2}}$, $\zeta$ is
a quadratic function of squashing.

Recalling that we are interested only in the{\it{ positive}} roots of
Eq.(\ref{refeq}), which exist only for values of $p$ given by
(\ref{psqsh}), we need not consider $\zeta$ corresponding to values
exceeding the bound of (\ref{psqsh}). Now $\zeta$, as a function of
$p$, increases monotonically from zero (for $p=0$) to its maximal
value corresponding to the equality of (\ref{psqsh}). It is
straightforward to check that this maximal value of $\zeta$ is
identically unity. We therefore {\it{do not}} need to consider the set
of solutions corresponding to $|\zeta|>1$ to find the two positive
roots at all. Each of the positive roots of (\ref{refeq}) (and other
roots within this bound) can therefore be given by a single analytic
expression. This is not specific to Eq.(\ref{refeq}), however, as
$\zeta$ will be equal to unity when the general trinomial equation
$x^{n}-a\,x^s+b=0$ has equal roots. The condition for this reads
\begin{equation}
\frac{s^s(n-s)^{n-s}}{n^{n}}\,a^{n}=b^{n-s}.
\end{equation}
In our case, the two positive roots become equal at $p =
\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)^\frac{2}{n-2}\left(1 -\frac{2}{n}\right)$
which is precisely the condition above as one can check comparing it
with (\ref{com}).

\subsubsection{Analytic Solutions}
The $n-2$ roots $x_{i}$'s of Eq.(\ref{refeq}) are found from
Eq.(\ref{ns}) by setting $\gamma=1$ and $a=1$ and $b=p$ :
\begin{equation}
x_{i}=
(e^{{\frac{2\pi\sqrt{-1}}{n-2}}})^{i}\left(F_{0}(\zeta)+\frac{1}{n-2}
\sum_{\kappa=1}^{n-3} (e^{{\frac{2\pi\sqrt{-1}}{n-2}}})
^{-i\,n\kappa}\mu_{\kappa} (-p)^{\kappa} F_{\kappa}(\zeta)\right)\\\\
\\ (i=1,2,...,n-2) \label{sol1}
\end{equation}
in which 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\kappa}=\frac{1}{\kappa}\frac{(\frac{1 -2
\kappa}{n-2}-1)!}{(\kappa-1)!(\frac{1 -2 \kappa}{n-2}-\kappa)!}.
\end{equation}
The remaining two roots are found from Eq.({\ref{s}):
\begin{equation}
x_{n-2+i}=\sqrt{p}\,e^{i\pi\sqrt{-1}}\left(\phi_{0}(\zeta)+\frac{1}{2}e^{i\,n\pi\sqrt{-1}}\,p^{\frac{n-2}{2}}\phi_{1}(\zeta)\right)\\\\
\\ (i=1,2).\label{sol2}
\end{equation}
The arguments of the function
\begin{equation}
F_{\kappa}(\zeta)=F \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
a_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & a_{n-1,\kappa}, & a_{n,\kappa}\\
b_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & b_{n-1,\kappa}, & \zeta
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
are given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
a_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{n-2}+\frac{n-i}{n}-\frac{1}{n(n-2)}
\,\,\, (i=1,2,\dots,n),\\
b_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{n-2}+\frac{3-i}{2}-\frac{1}{2(n-2)}
\,\,\, (i=1,2),\\
b_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{n-2}+\frac{i-2}{n-2}+\frac{\delta_{i}}{n-2}
\,\,\, (i=3,\dots,n-1),
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\delta_{i}=0, {\mathrm{when}}\,\,\, i<n-\kappa,\,\,\delta_{i}=1,
{\mathrm{when}}\,\,\, i \ge n-\kappa\label{delta}.
\end{equation}
The arguments of the function
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\kappa}(\zeta)=F\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
d_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & d_{n-1,\kappa}, & d_{n,\kappa}\\
e_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & e_{n-1,\kappa}, & \zeta
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
are given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
d_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{2}+\frac{i-1}{2}+\frac{1}{2\,n} \,\,\,
(i=1,2,\dots,n),\\
e_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{2}+\frac{i}{n-2}+\frac{1}{2\,(n-2)}
\,\,\, (i=1,2,\dots,n-2),\\
e_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{2}+1+\frac{i-n}{2}+\frac{\delta_{i}}{2}
\,\,\, (i=n-1),
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and $\delta_{i}$ is given through $(\ref{delta})$.
\subsubsection*{\it The two masses}
It is not difficult to single out the two positive roots from
(\ref{sol1}) and (\ref{sol2}). They are simply the $(n-2)$-th and
$n$-th roots. The masses of the two black hole solutions are therefore
given by the following simple expressions:
\begin{equation}
x_{+}=F_{0}(\zeta)+\frac{1}{n-2} \sum_{\kappa=1}^{n-3} \mu_{\kappa}
(-p)^{\kappa} F_{\kappa}(\zeta)\label{m1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
x_{-}=\sqrt{p}\,\left(\phi_{0}(\zeta)+\frac{1}{2}
p^{\frac{n-2}{2}}\phi_{1}(\zeta)\right)\label{m2}.
\end{equation}
The expressions (\ref{m1}-\ref{m2}) converge for $\zeta<1$. For the $\zeta=1$ case,
corresponding to $p=\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)^\frac{2}{n-2}\left(1
-\frac{2}{n}\right)$, the double-root is much simpler:
\begin{equation}
x=\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n-2}}.\label{lesmas}
\end{equation}
The solutions (\ref{m1}) and (\ref{m2}) gives us the masses of the two
infilling black hole solutions as analytic functions of the boundary
data. This enables us to find the corresponding Euclidean actions and
other thermodynamics quantities as analytic functions of the boundary
data and sets the ground for any future study in higher dimensional
black holes in a thermal cavity. Note that, the smaller mass
(\ref{m1}) will be less than the value of $x$ given by (\ref{lesmas}})
for which the specific heat capacity
\begin{equation}
C_{A}=4\pi(n-2) \,C^{n-1} \,(1-x^{n-2})\left(\frac{n}{2} x^{n-2}-1\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
is negative and hence the black hole solution is thermodynamically
unstable. The corresponding negative mode was found numerically in
\cite{GR}. This solution is therefore an instanton. However, the
larger mass black hole solution is locally thermodynamically
stable. 
\subsubsection{Action and Free energy}
Note that Eq.(\ref{4.6}) gives the critical temperature $T_{c}$ -- above
which the two black hole solutions exist -- to be inversely proportional to
the cavity-radius:
\begin{equation}
T_c=\frac{1}{4\pi}\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{n-2}}\sqrt{n(n-2)}
\,\frac{1}{\alpha}.
\end{equation}
Recall that any cavity can be filled in with a unique hot flat
space 
\begin{equation}
ds^2=d\tau^2+dr^2+r^2d\Omega_{n-1}^2
\end{equation}
for any temperature $T$ by giving $\tau$ the period $\frac{1}{T}$. For
$T<T_{c}$, the only classical solution within the cavity is hot flat
space whereas for temperature equal or above $T_{c}$ the two black
hole solutions add to the list. For either of the two black hole
solutions the Euclidean action (\ref{on-shell}) in the `background' of
the periodically identified flat space is given by:
\begin{equation}
I_{E}=\frac{1}{8G}\,{\frac {{\alpha}^{n-1}\,x\left
(n\,{x}^{n-2}+2\,(n-1)\left(\sqrt {1-{x}^{n-2}}-1\right)\right)}{\left
(n-2\right )}} .\label{ACTION}
\end{equation}
The flat space action has been subtracted so as to make the action
zero for zero mass. The actions for the two black holes can be found
by direct substitution of the two positive roots of Eq.(\ref{refeq})
in Eq.(\ref{ACTION}). The action is zero for $x=0$ (by virtue of the
above subtraction) and it increases monotonically to reach a maximum
and then decreases monotonically to the minimum value
\begin{equation}
I_{E_{min}}=
\frac{\alpha^{n-1}(1-3n)}{8G(n-2)}
\end{equation}
corresponding to $x=1$. This is strictly negative and hence the action
passes through zero for some non-zero value of $x$. It is fairly
straightforward to work out that this zero occurs for
\begin{equation}
x = \left ({\frac
{4(n-1)}{{n}^{2}}}\right )^\frac{1}{\left (n-2\right )}. \label{subs}
\end{equation}
Therefore for 
\begin{equation}
1\ge x >\left ({\frac
{4(n-1)}{{n}^{2}}}\right )^\frac{1}{\left (n-2\right )},
\end{equation}
the action will always be negative. Note that the values of $x$ within
this range is always greater than the value of $x$ given by
(\ref{lesmas}) and hence the action will be negative only for the
larger mass black hole and for a restricted range, i.e., if the
temperature is sufficiently high enough. Since the free energy is
$F=\beta I_{E}$, the larger-mass black hole nucleated spontaneously
from hot flat space for any temperature above this will be globally
thermodynamically stable. For a given cavity of radius $\alpha$, this
temperature can be found using Eq.(\ref{refeq}):
\begin{equation}
T_{s}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{n-2}{\sqrt{\left ({\frac
{4(n-1)}{{n}^{2}}}\right )^\frac{2}{\left (n-2\right )}-\left ({\frac
{4(n-1)}{{n}^{2}}}\right )^\frac{n}{\left (n-2\right )}}}\,\frac{1}{\alpha}.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Series Expansions}
The expressions (\ref{m1}) and (\ref{m2}) are exact and can be used
for precise calculation using the known properties of the higher order
hypergeometric functions (see, for example, \cite{bailey,
Slater}). However, in many situations, approximations via series
expansions in powers of the parameter are useful along with the exact
solutions. Obtaining such series for (\ref{m1}) and (\ref{m2}) is
nontrivial through their direct expansions. However, such series can
be obtained directly from (\ref{trinom}) by use of Lagrange
expansion. If
\begin{equation}
y=a+h\, \phi (y),
\end{equation}
where $\phi(y)$ a is function of $y$, the expansion of any function
$f(y)$ of $y$ is given by
\begin{equation}
f(y)=f(a)+ h(\phi f') + \frac{k^2}{2!} (\phi^2 f')'+\frac{k^3}{3!}
(\phi^3 f')''+ \dots. \label{exp}.
\end{equation}
There are three fundamental power series for all roots of a general
trinomial equations \cite{Eagle}, each of them precisely corresponding
to the three analytic expressions described in the Appendix, two for
$\zeta <1$, and one for $\zeta >1$. Since our solutions lie within the
bound $\zeta \le1$, only two of them will be of relevance.  We will
not discuss the general expansion for the general trinomial equation
(\ref{trinom}) -- interested readers are referred to
\cite{Eagle}. However, the method discussed below is the same for any
trinomial equation.

Note that for very small $p$, Eq.(\ref{refeq}) has two roots
approximately lying on a circle of radius $\sqrt{p}$ and the other
$(n-2)$ roots approximately on a circle of radius $1$ in the
$\bbbc$-plane. Following \cite{Eagle}, we rewrite Eq.(\ref{refeq}) as
\begin{equation}
y=1-p\,y^{\frac{-2}{n-2}},
\end{equation}
wherein $y\equiv x^{n-2}$. The Lagrange expansion (\ref{exp}) of the
function $f(y)=y^{\frac{1}{n-2}}$ then gives us the required series
for (\ref{m1}):
\begin{equation}
x_{+}=1-{\frac {p^{\frac{1}{2}}}{1!\,(n-2)}}-{\frac {\left (n+1\right
){p}^{2}}{2!\, \left (n-2\right )^{2}}}-{\frac {\left (n+3\right
)\left (2\,n+1 \right ){p}^{3}}{3!\,\left (n-2\right )^{3}}}-{\frac
{\left (n+5 \right )\left (2\,n+3\right )\left (3\,n+1\right
){p}^{4}}{4!\,\left (n-2 \right )^{4}}}-\dots . \label{ser1}
\end{equation}
Similarly defining $y\equiv x^2$ and rewriting Eq.(\ref{refeq}) as
\begin{equation}
y=p+y^{\frac{n}{2}},
\end{equation}
the Lagrange expansion of $f(y)=y^{\frac{1}{2}}$ gives us the
series for (\ref{m2}):
\begin{equation}
x_{-}=p^{\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{ p^{\frac{n-1}{2}}
}{1!\,2}\,+\frac{ \left (2n-1\right )p^{\frac{2n-3}{2}}  }{2!\,2^2}\,+\frac{  \left (3n-1
\right )\left (3n-3\right )p^{\frac{3n-5}{2}}  }{3!\,2^3}\,+
\frac{ \left (4n-1\right )\left (4n-3\right )\left (4n-5
\right )p^{\frac{4n-7}{2}}  }{4!\,2^4}\,+\dots  \label{ser2}
\end{equation}
The other complex/negative roots are obtained by multiplying
(\ref{ser1}) by the $(n-1)$ roots of $z^n-1=0$ and multiplying
(\ref{ser2}) by the other root of $z^2-1=0$, i.e., by $-1$
respectively.

Note that as one takes the boundary to infinity keeping the
temperature finite, the stable solution disappears and the instanton
solution $x_{-}$ survives thus making hot space unstable to the
nucleation of a black hole with negative specific heat as was seen in
\cite{Gross}. This happens for any non-zero temperature. Because this
solution has a negative specific heat it will be in unstable
equilibrium with its thermal environment. Only within a finite cavity
is it therefore possible to have a black hole which is
thermodynamically stable. However, the situation is different in the
presence of a negative cosmological constant as was shown in
\cite{BCM} for four dimensions. Work on higher dimensions are under
progress and will be reported in a forthcoming publication.
\section{Solving Taub-Nut and Taub-Bolt in Arbitrary Dimension}
In this section, we briefly discuss possible analytic solutions for
Taub-Nut and Taub-Bolt infilling geometries in higher dimensions. (We
have already mentioned the explicit solutions in the case of
Eguchi-Hanson metric in arbitrary dimension in the course of proving
uniqueness.) We have found solutions for the Taub-Nut and Taub-Bolt
solutions in four dimensions although in the case of the latter we did
not write down the explicit form as it is not particularly
illuminating. Note that higher dimensional Taub-Nut metrics all have
the same symmetry $(r,L) \leftrightarrow (-r,-L)$. With the same
substitutions used in four dimensions, namely,
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
x&=&r+L,\\
y&=&r-L,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
one can reduce the problem to the study of a univariate equation -- a
cubic in six dimensions, quartic in eight dimensions, i.e., an
equation of degree $(n+1)$ in $(2n+2)$ dimensions. The boundary-value
problem for Taub-Nut therefore can be solved exactly in up to eight
dimensions using radicals. We do not, however, write them here for
lack of space. For dimensions ten and above the relevant equations
will be quintic and above, and, as already mentioned, solutions in
terms of radicals are not possible in general. As discussed in the
previous section, one can solve the general equation of degree $n$ in
terms of the higher order hypergeometric functions\footnote{Recently
this has been done using $\cal{A}$-hypergeometric functions
\cite{Stu}.}. However, unlike the case of Schwarzschild, where we had
a trinomial equation, these will be higher order hypergeometric
functions of several variables.  Although it is possible in principle
to work them out explicitly, the solutions would not be illuminating
as in the case of Schwarzschild solutions and therefore we do not
attempt to do it here. Rather it is much easier to treat them
numerically. A numerical treatment is rather straightforward as we can
treat everything as a function of squashing only -- a simplification
resulting from the vanishing of the cosmological constant term.
\section{Convexity of the Solutions and Isoperimetric Inequalities}
Often the condition of convexity is applied to eliminate degenerate
infilling solutions for a given boundary. For example, an $S^{3}$ of
3-radius $r$ embedded in an $S^{4}$ of 4-radius greater than $r$
divides the $S^{4}$ into two unequal hemispheres both of which are
infilling solutions {\emph{a priori}}.  However, the smaller
hemisphere is the one which is convex, i.e., the eigenvalues of the
second fundamental form $K_{ij}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial
h_{ij}}{\partial n}$ are positive (using the convention that the
outward normal $n$ is positive) whereas for the larger hemisphere it
is the opposite. Discarding the latter leaves us with one unique
infilling solution.

It is fairly straightforward to check explicitly that $K_{ij}$ has
positive eigenvalues for both of the Schwarzschild solutions and for
the unique Eguchi-Hanson solution.  For the Taub-Nut or Taub-Bolt, the
second fundamental form can easily be computed in the orthonormal
frame:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
K_{\hat{1}\hat{1}}&=&\frac{1}{2\gamma}\frac{dh_{\hat{1}\hat{1}}}{dr}=\frac{\beta
r}{L},\\
K_{\hat{i}\hat{i}}&=&\frac{1}{2\gamma}\frac{dh_{\hat{i}\hat{i}}}{dr}=\frac{\beta}{4L}(\beta^{2})',\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{i}>1$. Since the scale factors, $\alpha(r)$ and $\beta(r)$
both increase monotonically (for any value of $L$) with $r$, both
$K_{\hat{1}\hat{1}}$ and $K_{\hat{i}\hat{i}}$ are strictly
positive. Therefore the unique infilling Taub-Nut solution and the two
Taub-Bolt infilling solutions are all convex without imposing any
further restrictions on the boundary data than those needed for the
solutions to exist.
\subsection{Lower Bound to the Action}
Since all the solutions are convex, it follows immediately from a
theorem by Reilly \cite{Reilly} that the following inequality holds
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2}}{ V} > \frac{2n+2}{2n+1}\int_{\Sigma} K dA \label{reilly}
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $dA$ are the volume and the volume element of the
boundary $\Sigma$ and $V$ is the volume of the $(2n+2)$-dimensional
manifold with the boundary $\Sigma$. Since the boundaries above are
convex for any infillings the right hand side of (\ref{reilly}) is
positive for all infilling solutions above. Note that this term is
proportional to the Euclidean action (\ref{ACTION}) with a negative
proportionality constant and hence the action is negative for all
infillings. The inequality (\ref{reilly}) therefore provides a lower
bound for the action of any infilling solution.
\subsection{Minkowski's Inequality}
For a $(d-1)$-dimensional closed surface $\Sigma$ in ${\Bbb E}^{d}$,
one has the following inequality due to Minkowski (see, for example,
\cite{hilbert}):
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^d}{V^{d-1}} \ge d^{d-1}\,\,\mathrm{Vol(S^{d-1})} \label{bound}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the $(d-1)$-volume of $\Sigma$, often referred to as
``area'', and $V$ is the volume of the ${\Bbb E}^{d}$ enclosed by it.
This states that for a closed surface of constant area the greatest
volume enclosed is that of a sphere (for which the equality holds). In
three dimensions, this gives the celebrated formula
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^3}{V^{2}} \ge 36\pi.
\end{equation}
%For a $(2n+1)$-dimensional surface immersed in Euclidean ${\Bbb R}^{2n+2}$%, one has the following inequality due to
%Minkowski (see,
%for example, \cite{hilbert}):
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}\ge 2^{2n+1}\,(n+1)^{2n+1}\,\mathrm{Vol(S^{2n+1})%},\label{bound}
%\end{equation}
%which states that for a surface of constant area the
%greatest volume enclosed is that of a sphere (for which the equality holds%). In three dimensions, this
%gives the celebrated formula
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{A^3}{V^{2}} \ge 36\pi.
%\end{equation}
Naturally, one therefore seeks the Ricci-flat counterparts to this
flat-space inequality. This is what we do in the following section
with our Ricci-flat metrics which admit a $U(1)$ action. It is not
obvious whether such inequalities would obey the bound (\ref{bound})
in general or under special conditions. As we will see, the machinery
we developed in the preceding sections for finding uniqueness or
non-uniqueness of the infilling solutions has already set the ground
for such an investigation. As before, we deal with four dimensions
first before going to higher dimensions. For the sake of convenience
we adopt the terminology of the flat space by denoting the
codimension-one volume of $\Sigma$ as $A$ and often refer to it as the
``area''. The term volume and $V$ will be reserved for the infilling
solutions.
\subsubsection{Schwarzschild Solutions}
\subsubsection*{Four Dimension}
For the Euclidean Schwarzschild metric Eq.(\ref{Sch}) the area of the
3-surface $\Sigma$ at radius $r$ is
\begin{equation}
A=r^2\,\int_{0}^{8\pi M}\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} dt
\int_{0}^{\pi }\sin\theta \,d\theta \int_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi=32 \pi^2 M
r^2\,\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}
The volume $V$ of the Euclidean Schwarzschild metric bounded by
$\Sigma$ is:
\begin{equation}
V=\int_{0}^{8\pi M} dt \int_{2M}^{r}s^2\, ds \int_{0}^{\pi }\sin\theta
\,d\theta \int_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi=\frac{32}{3}\pi^2 M
r^3\,\left(1-\left(\frac{2M}{r}\right)^3 \right)
\end{equation}
The dimensionless ratio is therefore
\begin{equation}
S\equiv \frac{A^4}{V^3}=32 \times
27\,\pi^2\,\frac{M}{r}\frac{\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{2}}{\left(1-(\frac{2M}{r})^3
\right)^3}.
\end{equation}
Rewriting $\frac{2M}{r}\equiv x$, as we did in Section $4$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
S(x)=16 \times 27\,\pi^2\,x\frac{\left(1-x\right)^{2}}{\left(1-x^3
\right)^3} \label{S1}
\end{equation}
Recall that for a given hypersurface $\Sigma$, there are in general
two Euclidean Schwarzschild infilling metrics which are given by the
two positive solutions for $x$ satisfying the following algebraic
equation
\begin{equation}
x^3-x^2+p=0,
\end{equation}
where $p=\frac{1}{4}\frac{\beta^2}{\alpha^2}$. This gives two black
hole solutions for a given $(\alpha, \beta)$ which determines the area
$A$ of $\Sigma$. As we have shown, for the smaller-mass black hole,
which is an instanton, $x_{-}\in[0,\frac{2}{3}]$ and for the
larger-mass black hole which is thermodynamically/dynamically stable
$x_{+}\in[\frac{2}{3},1]$.

It is easy to check that $S(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function
of $x$ in the interval $[0,1)$ and blows up at $x=1$. Therefore the
isoperimetric inequality for the lower-mass unstable Schwarzschild
infilling solution is
\begin{equation}
S(x_{-})\le S\left(\frac{2}{3}\right), 
\end{equation}
i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^4}{V^3} \le 32 \times
\left(\frac{27}{19}\right)^3\,\pi^2.
\end{equation}
For the larger mass, stable infilling solution this is
\begin{equation}
S(x_{+}) \ge S\left(\frac{2}{3}\right),
\end{equation}
i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^4}{V^3} \ge 32 \times
\left(\frac{27}{19}\right)^3\,\pi^2.
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{Arbitrary Dimension}
For convenience rewrite the Euclidean Schwarzschild metric in $(n+1)$
dimensions as
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=\left(1-\left(\frac{C}{r}\right)^{n-2}\right)
dt^{2}+\left(1-\left(\frac{C}{r}\right)^{n-2}\right)^{-1}dr^{2}+r^{2}ds_{M}^{2} \label{schd1}.
\end{equation}
This metric is regular provided $t$ has a period of
$\frac{4\pi}{n-2}C$. The area of a constant $r$-slice $\Sigma$ is
given by
\begin{equation}
A=\mathrm{Vol(M)} \,\frac{4\pi \,C}{(n-2)}\,
r^{n-1}\,\left(1-\left(\frac{C}{r}\right)^{n-2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
and the volume enclosed by it is 
\begin{equation}
V=\int_{0}^{\frac{4\pi \,C}{n-2}} dt \int_{C}^{r}s^{n-1}\, ds  \,\,\,\mathrm{Vol(M)}=\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\frac{4\pi \,C}{n(n-2)}\left(r^n-C^n\right)
\end{equation}
giving the ratio $S(x)$ which is therefore
\begin{equation}
S(x) \equiv \frac{A^{n+1}}{V^n}=\frac{4\pi
\,n^n}{(n-2)}\,\,\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\frac{x(1-x^{n-2})^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{(1-x^n)^n},
\label{Schrat}
\end{equation}
where $x\equiv \frac{C}{r}$ as before. Recall that in $(n+1)$
dimensions $x$ is the two positive roots of the trinomial equation
\begin{equation}
x^n-x^2+p=0,\label{618}
\end{equation}
where $p=\frac{(n-2)^2}{4}\frac{\beta^2}{\alpha^2}$. We found that for the
smaller-mass solution
$x_{-}\in
[0,\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{n-2}}]$ and for the larger-mass stable
solution $x_{+} \in [(\frac{2}{n})^{\frac{1}{n-2}},1]$. 

It can easily be seen from (\ref{Schrat}) that $S(x)$ increases
monotonically for $x$ within $[0,1)$ and blows up at $1$. Therefore
the isoperimetric inequalities for the two infilling Schwarzschild
black holes in $(n+1)$ dimensions are:
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{n+1}}{V^n} \le
\frac{4\,\pi}{(n-2)}\,\,\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\frac{2^{\frac{1}{n-2}}(\frac{1}{n})^{\frac{n}{2}}(n-2)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\left(1-(\frac{2}{n})^{\frac{n}{n-2}}
\right)^n}. \label{Schineqn1}
\end{equation}
for the smaller-mass unstable solution and 
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{n+1}}{V^n} \ge
\frac{4\,\pi}{(n-2)}\,\,\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\frac{2^{\frac{1}{n-2}}(\frac{1}{n})^{\frac{n}{2}}(n-2)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{\left(1-(\frac{2}{n})^{\frac{n}{n-2}}
\right)^n}\label{Schineqn2}
\end{equation}
for the larger mass stable solution.  Note that in the convention used
here the metric on the $(n-1)$ dimensional base manifold satisfies the
Einstein equation with a cosmological constant term of $(n-2)$ and
hence for $\mathrm{Vol(M)} \equiv S^{n-1}$, with the canonical round
metric on it, the volume is that of the ``unit'' $(n-1)$-dimensional
sphere and is equal to $2\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}/\Gamma(\frac{n}{2})$. With
this choice of base manifold it is easy to see that Minkowski's
inequality (\ref{bound}) is always true for the stable larger-mass
Schwarzschild solution in any dimension. However, it does not hold in
general for the lower-mass, unstable (instanton) solution.

\subsubsection{Taub-Nut}
\subsubsection*{Four dimension}
For the Taub-Nut metric (\ref{TN}) the area $A$ of a constant
$r$-slice is
\begin{equation}
A=32\pi^2\,L\left(r-L\right)^\frac{3}{2}\left(r+L\right)^\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}
and the volume enclosed within it is
\begin{equation}
V=2L\,\int_{L}^{r}(s^2-L^2)\,ds \int\, d\psi \wedge \sin\theta\,
d\theta \wedge d\phi= \frac{32}{3}\,\pi^2\,L\,(r-L)^2\,(r+2L).
\end{equation}
Therefore
\begin{equation}
S(r)\equiv \frac{A^4}{V^3}=32 \times
27\,\pi^2\,L\,\frac{(r+L)^2}{(r+2L)^3}.
\end{equation}
Rewriting $\frac{r}{L}\equiv \rho$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
S(\rho)=32 \times 27\,\pi^2\,\frac{(\rho+1)^2}{(\rho+2)^3}.
\end{equation}
This is a monotonically decreasing function of $\rho \ge 1$. Therefore
for the Taub-Nut space the isoperimetric inequality is
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^4}{V^3} \le 128\,\pi^2. \label{TNequ}
\end{equation}
Obviously this does not obey Minkowski's inequality. In fact this is
exactly the {\it{opposite}} of Minkowski's inequality.
\subsubsection*{Arbitrary dimension}
The higher dimensional Taub-Nut metric has the form
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=\gamma(r)^{2}dr^{2} +\beta(r)^{2}
\left(d\tau+A\right)^2+\alpha(r)^{2} {ds^{2}_{M}}. \label{TAB1}
\end{equation}
In $(2n+2)$ dimensions the area of the hypersurface $\Sigma$ at $r$ is
\begin{equation}
A=\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\beta\,\alpha^{2n}\,\int \,d\tau
\end{equation}
Following the conventions adopted in Section $2.2$, here $\gamma
\,\beta=c\,L$ and $\alpha^2=c(r^2-L^2)$. Recall that $\tau$ has period
$\beta_{\tau}=4\pi(n+1)/\lambda$ (as $k=1$ for Taub-Nut), where
$\lambda$ is the cosmological constant of the base $\bbbc P^{n}$. This
gives
\begin{equation}
A=\frac{4\pi(n+1)}{\lambda}\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,(\sqrt{c}L)^{2n+1}\,\tilde{\beta}\,(\rho^2-1)^n
\end{equation}
in which $\tilde{\beta}\equiv \beta/\sqrt{c}L$ is a function of
$\rho\equiv r/L$.  The volume bounded by $\Sigma$ is
\begin{equation}
V\equiv \int \,d\tau \,\int_L^{r}\gamma \,\beta \,\alpha^{2n} \, dr \,
\mathrm{Vol(M)}=(\sqrt{c}L)^{2n+2}\,\times
\frac{4\pi(n+1)}{\lambda}\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\int_1^{\rho} (\rho^2-1)^n\,
d\rho .
\end{equation}
The ratio is therefore
\begin{equation}
S(\rho)\equiv\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}=\frac{4\pi(n+1)}{\lambda}\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\tilde{\beta^2}^{n+1}(\rho^2-1)^n
\left(\frac{(\rho^2-1)^n}{\int_1^{\rho} (s^2-1)^n ds}\right)^{2n+1}.
\end{equation}
It is easy to evaluate the integral in the denominator above
\begin{equation}
\int_1^{\rho} (s^2-1)^n ds=\frac{2^n}{n+1}\,(\rho-1)^{n+1}\,
_2F_{1}[1+n,-n,n+2,\frac{1-\rho}{2}]. \label{nice}
\end{equation}
This gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}=\frac{4\pi(n+1)}{\lambda}\left(\frac{n+1}{2^n}
 \right)^{2n+1}\mathrm{Vol(M)}\, \,\tilde{\beta^2}^{n+1}(\rho^2-1)^n\,
 \left(\frac{(\rho+1)^n}{(\rho-1)\,_2F_{1}[1+n,-n,n+2,\frac{1-\rho}{2}]
 } \right)^{2n+1}.
\end{equation}
Recalling
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\beta}^2=\frac{\lambda\,2^{n}\,\rho\,(\rho-1)}{(n+1)(1+\rho)^{n}}\,{\rm{Appell}}F_{1}[n+1,2,-n,n+2,1-\rho,\frac{1-\rho}{2}].\label{app1}
\end{equation}
we obtain after simplification
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}&=&4\pi(n+1)\,\lambda^n\left(\frac{n+1}{2^n}
 \right)^{n}\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\rho^{n+1} (\rho+1)^{n(n+1)}\\ \\
 &\times&\frac{\left({\rm{Appell}}F_{1}[n+1,2,-n,n+2,1-\rho,\frac{1-\rho}{2}]\right)^{n+1}}{\left(_2F_{1}[1+n,-n,n+2,\frac{1-\rho}{2}]\right)^{2n+1}}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
It is easy to check that the fraction involving the two hypergeometric
functions is equal to unity at $\rho=1$ and monotonically decreases
with $\rho$.  It falls faster than $\rho^{n+1}(\rho+1)^{n(n+1)}$ and
falls more sharply with increasing (integer) values of $n$.  The
isoperimetric inequality is therefore
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}} \le 4\pi(n+1)\lambda^n\,\left(\frac{n+1}{2^n}
 \right)^{n}\mathrm{Vol(M)} \,
2^{n(n+1)}\,\,
\end{equation}
The volume of $\bbbc P^{n}$ with the Fubini-Study metric satisfying
the Einstein equations with cosmological constant $2(n+1)$ is $
\mathrm{Vol(S^{2n+1})/2\pi}(\equiv \pi^n/n!)$ and hence
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}\le 2^{2n+1}\,(n+1)^{2n+1}\mathrm{Vol(S^{2n+1})}\label{TNequ1}
\end{equation}
which is exactly the opposite of Minkowski's inequality (\ref{bound})
in $(2n+2)$ dimensions:
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}\ge 2^{2n+1}\,(n+1)^{2n+1}\mathrm{Vol(S^{2n+1})}.\label{Minkh}
\end{equation}
Therefore for the Taub-Nut metric in arbitrary dimension the analogue
of the Minkowski's inequality is exactly the opposite of the
Minkowski's inequality in flat space. Since the Taub-Nut metrics
approach flatness near the nut, the equality of (\ref{TNequ1})
coincides with that of (\ref{Minkh}) in flat space.
\subsubsection{Taub-Bolt}
\subsubsection*{Four dimension}
For the Taub-Bolt metric in four dimensions (\ref{Tbo}) $\psi$ has a
period of $4\pi$ and hence
\begin{equation}
A=32\pi^2\,L\left(r^{2}-2.5Lr +
L^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}(r^2-L^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
V=2L\,\int_{L}^{r}(s^2-L^2)\,ds \int\,\sin\theta\, d\psi \wedge
d\theta \wedge d\phi= \frac{32}{3}\,\pi^2\,L\,(r-L)^2\,(r+2L).
\end{equation}
giving
\begin{equation}
S(\rho)\equiv \frac{A^4}{V^3}=32 \times
27\,\pi^2\,\frac{\left(\rho^{2}-2.5\rho +
1\right)^2(\rho^2-1)^2}{(\rho-1)^6\,(\rho+2)^3}.
\end{equation}
where $\rho=r/L$ as before. At $\rho=2$, $S(\rho)$ is zero and
increases monotonically to a maximum and then decreases monotonically
to zero. The maximum value is approximately $64.69449106\pi^2$ and
occurs at $\rho=5.279392752$.

Recall that the two infilling Taub-Bolt solutions are separated at
$\rho \sim 2.851708133$, i.e, for a given boundary data below a
certain squashing there will be a solutions with $\frac{r}{L} \in
(2,2.851708133)$ and another solution with $\frac{r}{L}\in
(2.851708133, \infty)$. For a given boundary, therefore, the
smaller-$\rho$ solution (corresponding to larger $L$) will satisfy the
following inequality
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^4}{V^3} \le S(2.851708133) \sim 38.29964761\, \pi^2.
\end{equation}
However, for the larger-$\rho$ (corresponding to smaller value of $L$)
solution the inequality is
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^4}{V^3} < 64.69449106\,\pi^2\,\,\,\, (\mathrm{approximately}).
\end{equation}
Minkowski's inequality,
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^4}{V^{3}} \ge 128 \pi^2 \label{Mink4d},
\end{equation}
is not satisfied by either of the solutions under any circumstances.
\subsubsection*{Arbitrary dimension}
For the $(2n+2)$-dimensional Taub-Bolt solution
\begin{equation}
ds^{2}=\gamma(r)^{2}dr^{2} +\beta(r)^{2}
\left(d\tau+A\right)^2+\alpha(r)^{2} {ds^{2}_{M}} \label{TAB2}
\end{equation}
the area of a hypersurface $\Sigma$ at constant $r$ is
\begin{equation}
A=\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\beta\,\alpha^{2n}\,\int \,d\tau=\frac{4\pi
p}{\lambda\,k}\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,(\sqrt{c}L)^{2n+1}\,\tilde{\beta}\,(\rho^2-1)^n
\end{equation}
in which $\tilde{\beta}\equiv \beta/\sqrt{c}L$ is a function of
$\rho=r/L$. Since $\beta_{\tau}=4\pi p/k\lambda$ ($k<p$), the volume
enclosed within $\Sigma$ is
\begin{equation}
V= \int \,d\tau \,\int_{pL/k}^{r}\gamma \,\beta \,\alpha^{2n} \, dr \,
\mathrm{Vol(M)}=(\sqrt{c}L)^{2n+2}\,\times \frac{4\pi
p}{\lambda\,k}\mathrm{Vol(M)}\, \int_{pL/k}^{\rho} (\rho^2-1)^n\,
d\rho . \label{arbbolt}
\end{equation}
Here, as in the case of Taub-Nut, we are using the conventions of
Section 2.2.: $\gamma \,\beta=c\,L$ and $\alpha^2=c(r^2-L^2)$.  The
ratio is therefore
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}=\frac{4\pi
p}{\lambda\,k}\mathrm{Vol(M)}\,\tilde{\beta^2}^{n+1}(\rho^2-1)^n
\left(\frac{(\rho^2-1)^n}{\int_{p/k}^{\rho} (s^2-1)^n
ds}\right)^{2n+1} \label{bb}
\end{equation}
The integral in the denominator above can be evaluated. However,
unlike Eq.(\ref{nice}) the resulting form is not very
illuminating. Following the example of the 4-dimensional Taub-Bolt
above, we know that a closed form expression does not exist. This is
because the equality of the isoperimetric inequality in this case does
not lie at the bolt. However, note that the behaviour does not change
in higher dimensions. 
%Eq.(\ref{bb}) is a fraction made up of a
%monotonically increasing and a monotonically decreasing function of
%$\rho$. 
At the bolt, $\tilde{\beta}$ is zero while others are non-zero and
therefore $\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}$ is zero unlike in the nut
case. 
%Recall that $\beta$ stabilises at as $\rho\rightarrow \infty$ in
%which case the denominator increases faster than the numerator.  The
%ratio of two monotonically increasing functions (here the product in
%the numerator and the integral in the denominator) can have only one
%hump (i.e., it increases and then decreases monotonically or {\it{vice
%versa}}), 
As $\rho$ is increased $\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}$ will increase to a
certain value and then will start decreasing and approach zero
monotonically. The value of $\rho$ at which the hump of
$\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}$ occurs is greater than
the value of
$\rho$ for which the hump of $\frac{\beta(\rho)}{\alpha(\rho)}$ occurs. This has been shown explicitly above
for four dimensions leading to two different inequalities for the two
solutions. Note that compared to the Minkowski's inequality these two inequalities are opposite in
type. This happens also for Schwarzschild which also
possesses bolts -- however, in that case explicit inequalities are obtainable. Finally, note that for different Taub-Bolt solutions
(corresponding to values of $k\ne 1$) the corresponding
inequalities are {\it{not}} the ones obtained by dividing the
inequalities corresponding to $k=1$ by $k$. This is because the locations of
the bolts are different for different $k$'s. They need to be treated
separately should one look for the isoperimetric inequalities of a
certain type albeit they can only be found numerically.
\subsubsection{Eguchi-Hanson}
\subsubsection*{Four dimension}
For the Eguchi-Hanson metric (\ref{Eguchi-Hanson}) the 3-volume of a
constant $R$-slice hypersurface is
\begin{equation}
A=\pi^2\,R^3\left(1-\frac{a^{4}}{R^{4}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
and the 4-volume enclosed within it 
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{1}{8} \int_{a}^{R} s^3\,ds\, d\psi \wedge \sin\theta\, d\theta
\wedge d\phi= \pi^2\int_{a}^{R} s^3\,ds=\frac{\pi^2}{4}\left(R^4-a^4\right),
\end{equation}
giving
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^4}{V^3}=64\,\pi^2 \, \frac{1}{\left(1-\frac{a^4}{R^4}\right)}.
\end{equation}
The isoperimetric inequality is then
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^4}{V^3}\ge 64\,\pi^2.
\end{equation}
This sits precisely in the middle of the extremes of flat space and
Taub-Nut. Note that all three spaces are self-dual. It would be
interesting to investigate the isoperimetric inequalities in other
self-dual spaces in four dimensions which, however, is beyond the scope of this
paper.
\subsubsection*{Arbitrary dimension}
Recall that the Eguchi-Hanson metric (\ref{Egu}) was written using the
convention that $\lambda=2(n+1)$ and hence $\tau$ has a period of
$\frac{2\pi}{(n+1)}$.  The area of the constant-$r$ hypersurface and
the volume enclosed by it are respectively
\begin{equation}
A=r^{2n+1}\sqrt{1-\frac{a^{2n+2}}{r^{2n+2}}}\,\frac{2\pi}{(n+1)}
{\mathrm{Vol{(M)}}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{1}{2(n+1)}\,
r^{2n+2}\left(1-\frac{a^{2n+2}}{r^{2n+2}}\right)\,\frac{2\pi}{(n+1)}
{\mathrm{Vol{(M)}}}.
\end{equation}
and hence
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}}=\frac{2\pi}{(n+1)}
{\mathrm{Vol{(M)}}}\,2^{2n+1}\,(n+1)^{2n+1}\frac{1}{\left(1-\frac{a^{2n+2}}{r^{2n+2}}\right)^n}
\end{equation}
giving the isoperimetric inequality for the Eguchi-Hanson metric to be
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}} \ge 2^{2n+1}\,(n+1)^{2n}
{\mathrm{Vol{(M)}}}\label{Eguhidim}.
\end{equation}
For $M\equiv \bbbc P^{n}$ which in this convention has the volume of
the unit sphere $S^{2n+1}$ divided by $2\pi$, the isoperimetric
inequality ({\ref{Eguhidim}}) reads
\begin{equation}
\frac{A^{2n+2}}{V^{2n+1}} \ge 2^{2n+1}\,(n+1)^{2n}
{\mathrm{Vol({S^{2n+1}})}}\label{Eguhidim1}.
\end{equation}
This is just $\frac{1}{n+1}$ times the $(2n+2)$ dimensional
Minkowski's inequality (\ref{Minkh}) in flat space. This is therefore
always somewhere in the middle of flat space and Taub-Nut. Note that
this inequality illustrates another fundamental difference between the
Eguchi-Hanson case and the Schwarzschild and Taub-Bolt cases than
found in terms of number of infilling solutions. In the latter two
cases $S(\rho)$ is zero at the bolt whereas in this case $S(\rho)$
blows up at the bolt. The lower bound of (\ref{Eguhidim1}) comes from
$\rho\rightarrow \infty$. This explains (\ref{Eguhidim1}) immediately
via the periodicity of the fibre.
\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we studied the Dirichlet problem for cohomogeneity one
Ricci-flat metrics whose principal orbits are $S^1$ bundles over
compact Einstein spaces. We then investigated the subsequent
isoperimetric inequalities. In the case of trivial bundles the
Ricci-flat solutions are the Schwarzschild metrics for arbitrary
choices of the compact Einstein base. In the case of non-trivial
bundles the base spaces are required to be Einstein-K\""ahler and
solutions exist only in even dimensions. The resulting Ricci-flat
solutions can be classified using their 4-dimensional analogues: the
Eguchi-Hanson, the Taub-Nut and the Taub-Bolts. All of these metrics
can be topologically classified according to the presence and absence
of singular orbits, i.e., bolts or nuts. With the correct periodicity
of the $S^1$-fibre, bolts and nuts can be made regular and hence can
be included into the complete metric. In the case of Taub-Nut one
further requires the Einstein-K\""{a}hler base to be complex projective
space.

When the boundary $\Sigma$ is a non-trivial bundle of dimension three,
it is possible to find explicit 4-dimensional Taub-Nut and Taub-Bolt
solutions exactly by treating the problem as a system of two bivariate
equations. However, these equations become rather complicated as one
goes higher in the ladder of dimensionality making a case-by-case
study rather difficult and impossible analytically. This problem can
be circumvented by using a general approach involving differential
equations and polynomials which together provide a unified way of
treating the Taub-Nut and all Taub-Bolts (including those for which
$p<k<1$) in arbitrary dimension. This method also makes their
topologically different characters rather distinct. Such an approach
is possible because Ricci-flatness effectively reduce the problem to
the one-variable problem of squashing, i.e., involving the ratio of
the two radii of $\Sigma$ rather than their separate absolute values.
The Taub-Nut infilling solution is unique and the Taub-Bolt infilling
solution is double-valued in all dimensions and do not depend on
details like the choice of base and the periodicity of the $S^1$
fibre. The upper limit on the squashing for the boundary $\Sigma$ to
admit a Taub-Nut infilling is given by a simple function of
dimension. In the case of Taub-Bolts, however, we are not so
lucky. Upper limits on squashing, although a function of dimension
only need be worked out for each dimension (and for each possible
values of $k$) separately which is a straightforward task however. In
the case that $\Sigma$ is a trivial bundle the infilling Schwarzschild
geometry is double-valued in arbitrary dimension and does not depend
on the choice of the base manifold. The upper limit on the squashing
for $\Sigma$ to admit Schwarzschild solutions is a simple function of
dimension. One may therefore guess that the origin of non-uniqueness
is geometric and is related to the presence of a singular orbit of the
group action, i.e., a bolt. This is indeed the case. However, the
presence of a bolt acts as a necessary condition only. It is not a
sufficient condition as we found that the possible Eguchi-Hanson
infilling geometry in arbitrary dimension is unique despite the
presence of a bolt. It is worth recalling that the Eguchi-Hanson
metric in four dimensions has a self-dual Riemann tensor. Hence the
set of ordinary differential equations arising from the Einstein
equations is reduced to a first order set and the various scale
factors (here the two radii of the evolving hypersurface) fix the
values of their derivatives uniquely. They, however, are required to
satisfy the constraint equation. The Einstein equation then guarantees
a unique evolution (whether it is regular or non-regular at the origin
is an {\it a posteriori} issue). This is also true for the Taub-Nut in
four dimensions which is self-dual as well. In the presence of a
cosmological constant the Taub-Nut in four dimensions becomes
Taub-Nut-(anti)de Sitter which obviously does not have a self-dual
Riemann tensor. However, it has a self-dual Weyl tensor which reduces
the system to first order and thus the above comments apply. The
condition on the boundary data to have a self-dual Taub-Nut-AdS
solution has been discussed in detail in \cite{mma}. The infilling
geometries were found as exact analytic functions of the boundary data
despite the presence of a cosmological constant which involves the two
radii rather than their squashing. In the case of Taub-Bolt-AdS the
number of solutions can be as high as ten which has been shown in
\cite{Akbar1}.

In the case of trivial bundles, infilling Schwarzschild solutions were
obtained by finding the two masses of the black holes as analytic
functions of the two radii (effectively their squashing). To our
knowledge this is the first study of this kind of higher dimensional
Schwarzschild. With the relatively recent work on the negative mode of
higher dimensional Schwarzschild in a finite cavity \cite{GR}, this
provides a straightforward generalisation of the results obtained in
four dimensions. Since we have obtained the two masses of the black
holes as exact, analytic functions of the cavity radius and
temperature, our study provides a basis for further exact
semi-classical computations of black hole thermodynamics and dynamics
as all classical quantities can be evaluated from the geometry exactly
as functions of the cavity radius and its temperature. As one would
expect, the introduction of a cosmological constant would also make
the problem rather non-trivial. It is indeed the case. However, it has
been shown in \cite{BCM} that in four dimensions there are two
infilling Schwarzschild-AdS solutions in a finite isothermal cavity
with positive and negative specific heats. It remains to see how this
picture changes in higher dimensions and whether explicit solutions
for infilling geometries are possible. These will be reported
elsewhere.

We show that for all infilling solutions above, including those
occurring in pairs, the boundary is necessarily convex. This answers
the question posed by one of the authors at the Samos Meeting on
Cosmology, Geometry and Relativity, 1998 \cite{GCon} of whether
convexity can be applied as a criteria for selecting solutions if the
boundary admits more than one infilling geometry (of the same
type). We show that convexity cannot play such a role for Ricci-flat
spaces admitting $U(1)$ actions in general.  Using a relatively recent
theorem by Reilly \cite{Reilly}, we find that convexity gives a lower
bound of the Euclidean action for each infilling solution through the
$n$-volume of $\Sigma$ and the $(n+1)$-volume of the infilling
solutions ${\cal{M}}$.

Finally we have discussed the analogues of Minkowski's inequality and
found some interesting results. They can be grouped into two
classes. In one class we have the Taub-Nut and the Eguchi-Hanson
spaces. We found that the analogue of (flat-space's) Minkowski's
inequality for the Taub-Nut in arbitrary dimension is just the
opposite of Minkowski's inequality in that dimension. The
Eguchi-Hanson is found to lie in the middle in that its inequality has
the same {\it{sense}} as that of flat-space Minkowski and is
$\frac{1}{n+1}$ times the latter in $(2n+2)$ dimensions. We have
explained why this happens. The other class consists of the
Schwarzschild and the Taub-Bolt. In either case, the two infilling
geometries, although topologically equivalent, are strikingly
dissimilar in their isoperimetric inequalities. We have been able to
find the inequalities explicitly in the case of the Schwarzschild
solutions. The two inequalities are ``connected'' in that one is given
by being equal or greater than some value and the other by the
opposite of this inequality. Interestingly the isoperimetric
inequality for the larger mass stable black hole solution which has a
positive specific heat is always within Minkowski's bound. In
gravitational thermodynamics hot flat space is taken as the background
for the Schwarzschild calculations and hence this observation may have
some important thermodynamic consequences. For the Taub-Bolt the
nature of the polynomials involved prohibits one to obtain the
inequalities exactly, and also the two inequalities are not
``connected''. They both, however, have the same {\it{sense}} in that
they are given by being equal or less than some values. We have
obtained analytic expressions in a form from which it is
straightforward to find the approximate inequalities (for any choice
of base manifold $M$ and for any value of the periodicity $k$)
numerically should one need to know them. Note that both of the
inequalities obey the bound provided by their nut counterpart, i.e.,
by the Taub-Nut. Therefore the above comments about the flat space and
the Schwarzschild equally apply for the Taub-Nut and Taub-Bolt
solutions.

\appendix
\section{Trinomial Equations}
In this appendix we describe the solution to the general trinomial
equation following Birkeland \cite{Birkeland}. We write the generic
trinomial equation in the form
\begin{equation}
x^{n}-ax^{s}+b=0 
\end{equation}
where $a$ and $b$ are coefficients, in general complex, and
$n>s$. Define
\begin{equation}
\zeta=\frac{n^{n}}{s^{s}(n-s)^{n-s}}\frac{b^{n-s}}{a^{n}}.
\end{equation}
Two possibilities can occur depending on whether $|\zeta|<1$ or
$|\zeta|>1$.
\section*{$|\zeta|<1$}
Define
\begin{equation}
x=z a^{\frac{1}{n-s}},\,\,l=-b a^{\frac{-n}{n-s}}
\end{equation}
The $n-s$ roots are given by
\begin{equation}
x^{\gamma}_{i}=a^{\frac{\gamma}{n-s}}
\epsilon^{i\gamma}\left(F_{0}(\zeta)+\frac{\gamma}{n-s}
\sum_{\kappa=1}^{n-s-1} \epsilon^{-in\kappa}\mu_{\kappa} l^{\kappa}
F_{\kappa}(\zeta)\right) \label{ns}
\end{equation}
\begin{displaymath}
(i=1,2,...,n-s)
\end{displaymath}
where $\gamma$ is an arbitrary constant and
\begin{equation}
\epsilon=e^{{\frac{2\pi}{n-s}}\sqrt{-1}},\,\,
\mu_{1}=1,\,\,\,\mu_{\kappa}=\frac{1}{\kappa}\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\gamma -s \kappa}{n-s}-1\\ \kappa -1
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
F_{\kappa}(\zeta)=F \left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
a_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & a_{n-1,\kappa}, & a_{n,\kappa}\\
b_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & b_{n-1,\kappa}, & \zeta
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
are the higher order hypergeometric functions of order $n$ in
general\footnote{When $\zeta=1$, $F_{\kappa}(\zeta)$'s reduce to
hypergeometric functions of order $n-1$.}:
\begin{equation}
F_{\kappa}(\zeta)=\sum^{\infty}_\mu \frac{(a_{1,\kappa})_{\mu}\dots
(a_{n,\kappa})_{\mu} }{(b_{1,\kappa})_{\mu}\dots (b_{n,\kappa})_{\mu}}
\frac{\zeta^{\mu}}{\mu!}
\end{equation}
in which the Pochhammer symbol has been used: $(a)_{\mu}$ stands for
$a(a+1)(a+2)\dots(a+\mu-1)$. Also here
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
a_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{n-s}+\frac{n-i}{n}-\frac{\gamma}{n(n-s)}
\,\,\, (i=1,2,\dots,n),\\
b_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{n-s}+\frac{s-i+1}{s}-\frac{\gamma}{s(n-s)}
\,\,\, (i=1,2,\dots,s),\\
b_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{n-s}+\frac{i-s}{n-s}+\frac{\delta_{i}}{n-s}
\,\,\, (i=s+1,\dots,n-1).
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\delta_{i}=0, {\mathrm{when}}\,\,\, i<n-\kappa,\,\,\delta_{i}=1,
{\mathrm{when}}\,\,\, i \ge n-\kappa.
\end{equation}
Now define 
\begin{equation}
x=z
(-l)^{\frac{\gamma}{s}}a^{\frac{1}{n-s}},\,\,\,\lambda=(-l)^{\frac{n-s}{s}}=b^{\frac{n-s}{s}}\,g^{-\frac{n}{s}}.
\end{equation}
Under the condition $|\zeta| <1$, the remaining $s$ roots are
\begin{equation}
x^{\gamma}_{n-s+i}=(-l)^{\frac{\gamma}{s}}g^{\frac{\gamma}{n-s}}
\delta^{i\gamma}\left[\phi_{0}(\zeta)+\frac{\gamma}{s}\sum_{\kappa=1}^{s-1}\delta^{i\,n\,\kappa}\,\Delta_{\kappa}\lambda^{\kappa}\phi_{\kappa}(\zeta)\right]
\label{s}
\end{equation}
\begin{displaymath}
(i=1,2,...,s),
\end{displaymath}
where
\begin{equation}
\delta =e^{{\frac{2\pi}{s}}\sqrt{-1}},\,\,\,\,\,\,
\Delta_{1}=1,\,\,\,\,\,\,\Delta_{\kappa}=\frac{1}{\kappa}\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\gamma +n \kappa}{s}-1\\
\kappa -1
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\kappa}(\zeta)=F\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
d_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & d_{n-1,\kappa}, & d_{n,\kappa}\\
e_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & e_{n-1,\kappa}, & \zeta
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
in which
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
d_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{s}+\frac{i-1}{s}+\frac{\gamma}{s\,n} \,\,\,
(i=1,2,\dots,n),\\
e_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{s}+\frac{i}{n-s}+\frac{\gamma}{s\,(n-s)} \,\,\,
(i=1,2,\dots,n-s),\\
e_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{s}+1+\frac{i-n}{s}+\frac{\delta_{i}}{s} \,\,\,
(i=n-s+1,\dots,n-1),
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and $\delta_{i}$ is the same as before.

The expansions (\ref{ns}) and (\ref{s}) converge for $|\zeta
|<1$. They will diverge for $|\zeta|>1$ and hence the letter is
treated separately.
\section*{$|\zeta|>1$}
The roots
for $|\zeta|>1$ are given by higher order hypergeometric function of
the variable $\frac{1}{\zeta}$. Defining
\begin{equation}
x=z (-b)^{\frac{1}{n}},\,\,\,l_{1}=\rho=g (-b)^{-\frac{n-s}{n}},
\end{equation}
all of the $n$ roots are given by
\begin{equation}
x^{\gamma}_{i}=\beta^{\frac{\gamma}{n}} \nu^{i\,\gamma}\left[
\psi_{0}\left( \frac{1}{\zeta}\right)+ \frac{\gamma}{n}
\sum_{\kappa=1}^{n-1}
\nu^{i\,s\,\kappa}\,\theta_{\kappa}\,\rho^{\kappa}\psi_{\kappa}\left(
\frac{1}{\zeta}\right)\right]\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(i=1,2,\dots,n),
\end{equation}
in which
\begin{equation}
\nu=e^{\frac{2\,\pi}{n}\sqrt{-1}},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\theta_{1}=1,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\theta_{\kappa}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\frac{\gamma +s \kappa}{n}-1\\ \kappa -1
\end{array}\right),
\end{equation}
and $\gamma$ is an arbitrary constant as before.

The $\psi$'s here are hypergeometric functions of order $n$ with the
explicit form:
\begin{equation}
\psi_{\kappa}\left( \frac{1}{\zeta}\right)=F\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
g_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & g_{n-1,\kappa}, & d_{n,\kappa}\\
h_{1,\kappa}, & \dots, & h_{n-1,\kappa}, & \zeta
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
in which
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
g_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{n}+\frac{i-1}{s}+\frac{\gamma}{s\,n}
\,\,\, (i=1,2,\dots,s),\\
g_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa}{n}+\frac{n-i}{n-s}-\frac{\gamma}{n\,(n-s)}
\,\,\, (i=1,2,\dots,n),\\
h_{i,\kappa}&=&\frac{\kappa+i}{s}+\frac{\delta_{i}}{n} \,\,\, (i=1,
2,\dots,n-1),
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{i}$ is the same as before.
