String theory gives rise to various mechanisms to generate
primordial inflation, of which ``brane inflation'' is one of
the most widely considered. In this scenario, inflation takes
place while two branes are approaching each other, and the
modulus field representing the separation between the branes
plays the role of the inflaton field. We study the phase
space of initial conditions which can lead to a sufficiently
long period of cosmological inflation, and find that taking
into account the possibility of nonvanishing initial momentum
can significantly change the degree of fine tuning of the required initial
conditions.
