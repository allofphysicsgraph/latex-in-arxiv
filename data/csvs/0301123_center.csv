{\bf Abstract}
A 
holographic interpretation for
some specific Ricci flat string backgrounds of the form $A_6\times C_4$ is proposed. 
The conjecture is that there is a Four-dimensional Euclidean Conformal Field Theory (ECFT) defined 
on a codimension two
{\em submanifold} of the manifold $A_6$ (where one of the two 
remaining {\em holographic} coordinates of $A_6$ is timelike, and the other one spacelike), with 
central charge proportional
 to the radius of curvature of the six-dimensional manifold, $c\sim l^4$.
