A highly excited (closed or open) string state on the leading Regge trajectory 
can be represented by a rotating soliton solution. There is
a semiclassical probability per unit cycle that this string can spontaneously
break into two pieces.
Here we find the resulting solutions for the outgoing two pieces, 
which describe two specific excited string states, and show that this semiclassical picture  reproduces very accurately 
the features of the quantum calculation of decay in the large mass $M$ limit.
In particular, this picture prescribes 
the precise analytical relation of the masses $M_1$ and $M_2$ of the decay
products, and indicates that the lifetime of these string states 
grows with the mass as  ${\cal T}={\rm const.} \a' \ M$, in agreement with the 
quantum calculation.
Thus, surprisingly,  a string with maximum angular momentum becomes 
more stable for larger masses.
We also point out some interesting features of the evolution  after
the  splitting process.
