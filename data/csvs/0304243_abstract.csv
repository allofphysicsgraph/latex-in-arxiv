A simple method for breaking gauge groups by orbifolding
is presented. We extend the method of Kac and Peterson to
include Wilson lines. The complete classification of the
gauge group breaking, e.g. from heterotic string,
is now possible. From this Dynkin diagram technique,
one can easily visualize the origin and the symmetry
pattern of the surviving gauge group.
