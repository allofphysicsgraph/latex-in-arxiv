	\item For any $x\in\xi$ and $z\in\zeta$, the reduction of
	$\m(\xi,\zeta)$ to $\A(z)\to\A(x)$ is $\m(x,z)$.
	\item If $\xi$ is a complete past of $\zeta$, then $\m(\xi,\zeta)$ is
	a homomorphism.
	\item If $\zeta$ is a complete future of $\xi$, then
	$\m^\dagger(\xi,\zeta)$ is a homomorphism.
	\item If $\xi\preceq\zeta$ is a complete pair, then $\m(\xi,\zeta)$ is
	an isomorphism.
\item If $\xi\preceq\upsilon\preceq\zeta$, then $\m(\xi,\upsilon)\circ \m(\upsilon,\zeta)=\m(\xi,\zeta)$.

\item
 The original definition considering them as the general formalism for quantum causal histories \cite{Mar00}.
 \item
As an algebraic quantum field theory on a causal set (Section \ref{QFT}).
 \item
 As an alternative to the usual quantum cosmology of a wavefunction of the universe evolving according to the Wheeler-De\,Witt equation.    A QCH is a framework for quantum cosmology that is not restricted to globally hyperbolic spacetimes, as is the case with a WDW-type quantum cosmology. This is discussed in more detail in \cite{Mar02}.
\item
 The local evolution in a QCH is well-suited for addressing the important problem of identifying localized propagating  degrees of freedom in a spin foam, without having to use the entire partition function.
 \item
  Precisely the same objects that we used (matrix algebras and CP maps) are basic tools in quantum information theory.  Conceptually, this suggests that the universe modeled as a QCH is nothing but a background-independent quantum computer.   More practically, the analogue of the much sought-after propagating ``particle'' in a spin foam, in quantum information theoretic language, is a quantum channel. Tools such as the operator-sum representation of CP maps, and even ideas from the theory of error-correction in quantum computation,  might be used to identify such objects.
