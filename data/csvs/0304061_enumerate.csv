\item First, express the quantities ${\rm Tr}(\Phi^{m+1})$ in terms of
the $s_i$ that appear in (\ref{defP}).
\item Next, determine the submanifold of the ${\cal N}=2$ theory on
which there are at least $N-k$ mutually local massless monopoles/dyons. On this
submanifold, the Seiberg-Witten curve degenerates and can be written in
the form
\begin{equation} \label{pcollapse}
y^2 = P_N^2(x)- 4 \Lambda^{2N} = H^2_{N-k}(x) T_{2k}(x)
\end{equation}
for some polynomials $H,T$ of degrees $N-k$, $2k$ respectively. As can
be seen from (\ref{pcollapse}), $N-k$ one-cycles have collapsed.
\item Minimize the classical superpotential, expressed in terms of the $s_i$,
on this submanifold. The resulting extrema are the quantum vacua.
\item One can then show that the quantum vacua are in one-to-one
correspondence with points on the moduli space where in addition to
(\ref{pcollapse}) we also have
\begin{equation} \label{wcollapse}
G^2_{n-k}(x) T_{2k}(x) = W'(x)^2 + f_{n-1}(x)
\end{equation}
for some polynomials $G,f$ of degrees $n-k,n-1$, and where $T$ is the same
polynomial that appears in (\ref{pcollapse}). Equation (\ref{wcollapse}) can
be viewed as a degeneration of the matrix model curve.
\item Finally, we need to check that the classical limit
of $P_N(x)$ is indeed $\prod_i (x-a_i)^{N_i}$, so that it indeed is a quantum
vacuum corresponding to the appropriate classical vacuum.
