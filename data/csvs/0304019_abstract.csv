We study geometric engineering of four-dimensional  
$N=1$ gauge  models from M-theory on a seven-dimensional manifold 
with $G_2$ holonomy. The manifold is constructed as a K3 fibration over a
three-dimensional base space with $ADE$ geometry. The resulting
gauge theory is discussed in the realm of $(p,q)$ webs.
We discuss how the anomaly cancellation condition translates into 
a condition on the associated affine $ADE$ Lie algebras.
