A set of brackets for  classical dissipative systems, subject to
external random forces, are derived. The method is inspired to the
old procedure found by Peierls, for deriving the canonical
brackets of conservative systems, starting from an action
principle. It is found that an adaptation of Peierls' method is
applicable also to dissipative systems, when the friction term can
be described by a linear functional of the coordinates, as is the
case in the classical Langevin equation, with an arbitrary memory
function.  The general expression for the brackets satisfied by
the coordinates, as well as by the external random forces, at
different times, is determined, and it turns out that they all
satisfy the Jacobi identity. Upon quantization, these classical
brackets  are found to coincide with the commutation rules for the
quantum Langevin equation, that  have been obtained in the past,
by appealing to microscopic conservative quantum models for the
friction mechanism.
