\medskip
Recently, in a series of papers \cite{1} a new class of
topological gauge theories in two dimensions was presented which
is neither of Witten type nor of Schwarz type (for a review of
topological quantum field theories (TQFT), see, e.g., \cite{2}).
Rather, they show some of the characteristic features of both
types of TQFT, namely, the form of the action turns out to be of
Witten type whereas the underlying supersymmetries are reminiscent of
Schwarz type.

The aim of this Letter is to reveal these rather unusual
properties of a TQFT. Thereby, we focus on the simplest of the
models considered in \cite{1}, namely the Euclidean Maxwell theory
in two dimensions in the Feynman gauge. Their action is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{1.1}
S = \int_E d^2x\, \Bigr\{
\hbox{$\frac{1}{4}$} F^{\mu\nu}(A) F_{\mu\nu}(A) +
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} \partial^\mu A_\mu \partial^\nu A_\nu +
\partial^\mu \bar{C} \partial_\mu C \Bigr\}\,,
\end{equation}
with $F_{\mu\nu}(A) = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$, where
$A_\mu$ is the Abelian gauge field and $C$, $\bar{C}$ are the gauge
(anti)ghost fields, respectively.

In \cite{1} it has been shown that the action (\ref{1.1}) is not
only invariant under the BRST symmetry, generated by $\Omega$, but
also under a co--BRST symmetry, generated by $^\star \Omega$,
which, together with the BRST Laplacian $W$, obey the following
BRST--complex:
\begin{equation}
\label{1.2}
\Omega^2 = 0,
\qquad
^\star \Omega^2 = 0,
\qquad
W = \{ \Omega, \,^\star \Omega \} \neq 0,
\qquad
[ \Omega, W ] = 0,
\qquad
[ \,^\star \Omega, W ] = 0.
\end{equation}

Representations of this superalgebra for the first time have been
considered in \cite{3}. Since $\Omega$ and $^\star \Omega$ are
nilpotent hermitian operators they are realized in a Krein space
$\cal K$ \cite{4} whose non--degenerate indefinite scalar product
$\langle \chi | \psi \rangle := (\chi, J \psi)$ is defined by the
help of a self--adjoint metric operator $J \neq 1$, $J^2 = 1$.
With respect to the inner product $(\,\,, \;)$ the operators
$\Omega$ and $^\star \Omega = \pm J \Omega J$ are adjoint to each
other, $(\chi, \,^\star \Omega \psi) = (\Omega \chi, \psi)$, but
with respect to the scalar product $\langle \,\, | \; \rangle$
they are self--adjoint.

From these definitions one obtains a remarkable correspondence
between the BRST cohomology and the de Rham cohomology \cite{5}:
\begin{alignat*}{4}
&\hbox{BRST operator}
&\quad&
\Omega,
&\qquad\qquad&
\hbox{differential}
&\quad&
d,
\\
&\hbox{co--BRST operator}
&\quad&
^\star\Omega = \pm J \Omega J,
&\qquad\qquad&
\hbox{co--differential}
&\quad&
\delta = \pm \star d \star,
\\
&\hbox{duality operation}
&\quad&
J,
&\qquad\qquad&
\hbox{Hodge star}
&\quad&
\star,
\\
&\hbox{BRST Laplacian}
&\quad&
W = \{ \Omega, \,^\star\Omega \},
&\qquad\qquad&
\hbox{Laplacian}
&\quad&
\Delta = \{ d, \delta \}.
\end{alignat*}
Hence, the action (\ref{1.1}) provides a Hodge type field
theoretical model in two dimensions. However, owing to the absence
of a shift and co--shift symmetry, the action is not of Witten
type and, because the Maxwell action in a gravitational background
is not metric independent, it is also not of Schwarz type.
Differently, the topological nature of that model is a consequence
of the fact that in two dimensions there are no propagating
degrees of freedom associated with the gauge field. On the other
hand, since there is no topological supersymmetry, on--shell, the
BRST Laplacian vanishes. This is, in fact, an unsatisfactory
property of a Hodge type theory because their physical states
should lie entirely in the set of harmonic states, i.e., the set
of the zero modes of the BRST Laplacian. Therefore, in order to
improve the topological nature of that model, it will be shown
that it can be regarded as part of a more complex topological
model of Witten type, namely the twisted $N = 16$, $D = 2$ super
Maxwell theory with global symmetry group $SU(4)$, whose {\it
basic} cohomology \cite{6} possesses actually a Hodge--type
structure.

The Letter is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, as a first step,
we substitute in (\ref{1.1}) the Maxwell action by the
cohomological action of twisted $N = 16$, $D = 2$ super Maxwell
theory with global symmetry group $SU(4)$. And we show that the
BRST complex of the $8$ twisted scalar supercharges, i.e., the
generators of the shift and co--shift symmetries, is really of
Hodge type. In Sect. 3, as a second step, we complete the
cohomological action by introducing the ordinary gauge fixing
terms and verify that the basic cohomology, i.e., the BRST complex
including also the ordinary gauge symmetry, preserves the
underlying Hodge--type structure.

\medskip
As mentioned above, in order to avoid the vanishing of the BRST
Laplacian of the topological model proposed in \cite{1} we view
the Maxwell action in (\ref{1.1}) as the classical part of the
twisted action of $N = 16$, $D = 2$ super Maxwell theory with
global symmetry group $SU(4)$ (see, e.g., \cite{7} where the
non--Abelian extension of that action has been constructed),
\begin{align}
\label{2.1}
S_T^{(N_T = 8)} = \int_E d^2x\, \Bigr\{&
\hbox{$\frac{1}{4}$} F^{\mu\nu}( A + i V ) F_{\mu\nu}( A - i V ) +
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} \partial^\mu V_\mu \partial^\nu V_\nu
\nonumber
\\
& + \hbox{$\frac{1}{8}$} \partial^\mu M_{\alpha\beta}
\partial_\mu M^{\alpha\beta} -
\epsilon^{\mu\nu} \bar{\zeta}_\alpha \partial_\mu \psi_\nu^\alpha -
\bar{\eta}_\alpha \partial^\mu \psi_\mu^\alpha \Bigr\}.
\end{align}
Here, $V_\mu$ is a co--vector field which is combined with $A_\mu$ to
forms the complexified gauge fields $A_\mu \pm i V_\mu$, i.e., the
action (\ref{2.1}) localizes onto the moduli space of complexified
flat connections. Furthermore, we have introduced a
$SU(4)$--quartet of Grassmann--odd vector fields
$\psi_\mu^\alpha$, two $SU(4)$--quartets of Grassmann--odd scalar
fields, $\bar{\eta}_\alpha$ and $\bar{\zeta}_\alpha$, which
transform as the fundamental and its complex conjugate
representation of $SU(4)$, respectively, and a $SU(4)$--sextet of
Grassmann--even complex scalar fields $M_{\alpha\beta} =
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} \epsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}
M^{\gamma\delta}$, which transform as the second--rank complex
selfdual representation of $SU(4)$, where $\alpha = 1,2,3,4$
denotes the internal group index of $SU(4)$. $\epsilon_{\mu\nu}$
is the antisymmetric Levi--Civita tensor in $D = 2$.

Let us notice that the action (\ref{2.1}) can be obtained from the
Euclidean $N = 16$, $D = 2$ super Maxwell theory with R--symmetry
group $SU(4) \otimes U(1)$ by twisting the Euclidean rotation
group $SO_E(2) \sim U_E(1)$ in $D = 2$ by the $U(1)$ of the
R--symmetry group (by simply putting together both $U(1)$
charges), thereby leaving the group $SU(4)$ intact \cite{8}.

The action (\ref{2.1}) is invariant under the following discrete
Hodge--type $\star$--symmetry, defined by the replacements
\begin{equation}
\label{2.2}
\varphi \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
\partial_\mu & A_\mu & V_\mu &
\\
\psi_\mu^\alpha & \bar{\eta}_\alpha & \bar{\zeta}_\alpha & M^{\alpha\beta}
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\star \varphi = \begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{\mu\nu} \partial^\nu & \epsilon_{\mu\nu} A^\nu &
- \epsilon_{\mu\nu} V^\nu &
\\
- i \psi_\mu^\alpha & - i \bar{\zeta}_\alpha & i \bar{\eta}_\alpha &
- M^{\alpha\beta}
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
with the property $\star (\star \varphi) = \pm \varphi$.

Let us now describe the full set of twisted supersymmetry transformations
which leave the action (\ref{2.1}) invariant. The transformation rules for
the {\it on--shell} shift symmetries $Q^\alpha$ are
\begin{align}
\label{2.3}
&Q^\alpha A_\mu = \psi_\mu^\alpha,
\nonumber
\\
&Q^\alpha V_\mu = - i \psi_\mu^\alpha,
\nonumber
\\
&Q^\alpha M_{\beta\gamma} = 2 i \delta^\alpha_{~[\beta}
\bar{\zeta}_{\gamma]},
\nonumber
\\
&Q^\alpha \psi_\mu^\beta = - i \epsilon_{\mu\nu} \partial^\nu M^{\alpha\beta},
\nonumber
\\
&Q^\alpha \bar{\eta}_\beta = - i \delta^\alpha_{~\beta}
\partial^\mu V_\mu,
\nonumber
\\
&Q^\alpha \bar{\zeta}_\beta = \hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$}
\delta^\alpha_{~\beta} \epsilon^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu}(A - i V).
\end{align}
From combining $Q^\alpha$ with the above displayed Hodge--type
$\star$--symmetry one gets the corresponding transformation rules
for the {\it on--shell} co--shift symmetries $^\star Q^\alpha$,
i.e., $^\star Q^\alpha \varphi = \pm \star Q^\alpha \star
\varphi$, where the signs are the same as in the relation $\star
(\star \varphi) = \pm \varphi$.

Furthermore, by making use of the identity $\epsilon_{\mu\nu}
\partial_\rho + \epsilon_{\nu\rho} \partial_\mu +
\epsilon_{\rho\mu} \partial_\nu = 0$, one simply verifies that
(\ref{2.1}) is also invariant under the following {\it on--shell}
vector supersymmetries $\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha}$:
\begin{align}
\label{2.4}
&\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} A_\nu = \delta_{\mu\nu} \bar{\eta}_\alpha -
\epsilon_{\mu\nu} \bar{\zeta}_\alpha,
\nonumber
\\
&\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} V_\nu = - i \delta_{\mu\nu} \bar{\eta}_\alpha -
i \epsilon_{\mu\nu} \bar{\zeta}_\alpha,
\nonumber
\\
&\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} M^{\beta\gamma} = 2 i \epsilon_{\mu\nu}
\delta_\alpha^{~[\beta} \psi^{\nu \gamma]},
\nonumber
\\
&\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} \psi_\nu^\beta = i \delta_\alpha^{~\beta}
\delta_{\mu\nu} \partial^\rho V_\rho -
\delta_\alpha^{~\beta} \partial_\mu ( A_\nu + i V_\nu ) +
\delta_\alpha^{~\beta} \partial_\nu ( A_\mu - i V_\mu ),
\nonumber
\\
&\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} \bar{\eta}_\beta = i \epsilon_{\mu\nu}
\partial^\nu M_{\alpha\beta},
\nonumber
\\
&\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} \bar{\zeta}_\beta = i \partial_\mu M_{\alpha\beta}.
\end{align}
In principle, owing to the Hodge--type $\star$--symmetry, one can
also introduce {\it on--shell} co--vector supersymmetries $^\star
\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha}$, namely, similar as before, according to
$^\star \bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} \varphi = \pm \star \bar{Q}_{\mu
\alpha} \star \varphi$. However, they become $i$ times the {\it
on--shell} vector supersymmetries $\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha}$, i.e.,
$^\star \bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} = i \bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha}$. Hence, it
holds
\begin{equation*}
( Q^\alpha, \,^\star Q^\alpha, \bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha} ) S_T^{(N_T = 8)} = 0,
\end{equation*}
and the total number of (real) supercharges is actually $N = 16$.

By an explicit calculation one establishes that the $8$ scalar
supercharges $Q^\alpha$ and $^\star Q^\alpha$, being interrelated
by the $\star$--operation, together with the $8$ vector
supercharges $\bar{Q}_{\mu \alpha}$, obey the following
topological superalgebra {\it on--shell},
\begin{equation*}
\{ Q^\alpha, Q^\beta \} \doteq 0,
\qquad
\{ Q^\alpha, \,^\star Q^\beta \} \doteq - 2 \delta_G(M^{\alpha\beta}),
\qquad
\{ \,^\star Q^\alpha, \,^\star Q^\beta \} \doteq 0,
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\{ Q^\alpha, \bar{Q}_{\mu \beta} \} \doteq
- 2 \delta^\alpha_{~\beta} (
\partial_\mu - \delta_G(A_\mu - i V_\mu) ),
\qquad
\{ \,^\star Q^\alpha, \bar{Q}_{\mu \beta} \} \doteq
- 2 \delta^\alpha_{~\beta} (
\partial_\mu - \delta_G(A_\mu + i V_\mu) ),
\end{equation*}
where the field--dependent gauge transformations $\delta_G(\varphi)$,
with $\varphi = (M^{\alpha\beta}, A_\mu \pm i V_\mu)$, are defined by
$\delta_G(\varphi) A_\mu = \partial_\mu \varphi$, and zero otherwise.

Finally, let us show that the twisted action (\ref{2.1}) is
actually of Witten type, i.e., that a $SU(4)$ transformation can
be performed in such way that this action spits into a topologial
term ($Q$--cocyle) and a $Q$--exact term, where $Q$ is a certain
linear combination of the scalar supercharges $Q^\alpha$ and
$^\star Q^\alpha$. This is precisely what we need in order to put
the theory on a two--dimensional Riemannian manifold.

For that purpose let us consider the following $N_T = 1$ topological
action in five dimensions,
\begin{align}
\label{2.5}
S_T^{(N_T = 1)} = \int_E d^5x\, \Bigr\{&
\hbox{$\frac{1}{4}$} F^{ab}( A + i V ) F_{ab}( A - i V ) +
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} \partial^a V_a \partial^b V_b
\nonumber
\\
& - \hbox{$\frac{1}{8}$} i \epsilon^{abcde} \chi_{ab} \partial_c \chi_{de} -
i \chi^{ab} \partial_a \psi_b - i \psi^a \partial_a \eta \Bigr\},
\end{align}
which is build up from the Abelian gauge field $A_a$, the co--vector field
$V_a$ and the Grassmann--odd antisymmetric tensor, vector and scalar fields
$\chi_{ab}$, $\psi_a$ and $\eta$, respectively. Here, the space index $a$
runs from $1$ to $5$ and $\epsilon_{abcde}$ is the complete antisymmetric
Levi--Civita tensor in $D = 5$.
This action can be obtained from the Euclidean $N = 2$, $D = 5$ super Maxwell
theory with R--symmetry group $SO(5)$ by twisting the Euclidean rotation group
$SO_E(5)$ in $D = 5$ by the R--symmetry group (for details, see \cite{7}).

Let us now group the components of the$5$--dimensional fields
$A_a$, $V_a$, $\chi_{ab}$, $\psi_a$, $\eta$ into those of the
$2$--dimensional fields $A_\mu$, $V_\mu$, $M_{\alpha\beta}$,
$\psi_\mu^\alpha$, $\bar{\eta}_\alpha$, $\bar{\zeta}_\alpha$
according to
\begin{alignat*}{2}
&M_{1 \alpha} = \begin{cases}
A_3 + i V_3 \\ - A_4 - i V_4 \\ A_5 + i V_5 \end{cases},
&\qquad
&M^{1 \alpha} = \begin{cases}
A_3 - i V_3 \\ - A_4 + i V_4 \\ A_5 - i V_5 \end{cases},
\qquad
\alpha = 2,3,4,
\\
&\bar{\eta}_\alpha = \begin{cases}
i \eta \\ i \chi^{45} \\ - i \chi^{53} \\ i \chi^{34} \end{cases},
&\qquad
&\bar{\zeta}_\alpha = \begin{cases}
i \chi^{12} \\ - i \psi_3 \\ i \psi_4 \\ - i \psi_5 \end{cases},
\qquad
\psi_\mu^\alpha = \begin{cases}
\psi_\mu \\ \epsilon_{\mu\nu} \chi^{\nu 3} \\
- \epsilon_{\mu\nu} \chi^{\nu 4} \\
\epsilon_{\mu\nu} \chi^{\nu 5} \end{cases},
\end{alignat*}
where $(A_a, V_a)$ agrees with $(A_\mu, V_\mu)$ for $a = 1,2$.
Then, it is easily seen that by squeezing the action (\ref{2.5}) into two
dimensions one arrives precisely at the $N_T = 8$ topological action
(\ref{2.1}).

On the other hand, on--shell, upon using the equation of motion
for $\eta$, the action (\ref{2.5}) can be written as a sum of a
topological term ($Q$--cocycle) and a $Q$--exact term,
\begin{equation}
\label{2.6}
S_T^{(N_T = 1)} \doteq - \int_E d^5x\, \Bigr\{
\hbox{$\frac{1}{8}$} i \epsilon^{abcde} \chi_{ab} \partial_c \chi_{de}
\Bigr\} + Q \Psi,
\qquad
Q^2 \doteq 0,
\end{equation}
with the gauge fermion
\begin{equation*}
\Psi = \int_E d^5x\, \Bigr\{
\hbox{$\frac{1}{4}$} i \chi_{ab} F^{ab}( A + i V ) -
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} \eta \partial^a V_a \Bigr\}.
\end{equation*}
The topological supersymmetry transformations, generated by $Q$, are given by
\begin{align*}
&Q A_a = \psi_a,
\\
&Q V_a = - i \psi_a,
\\
&Q \psi_a = 0,
\\
&Q \eta = - \partial^a V_a,
\\
&Q \chi_{ab} = - i F_{ab}(A - i V).
\end{align*}
Notice that the $Q$--invariance of the first term in (\ref{2.6}) is
a consequence of the Bianchi identity.

Hence, by squeezing also (\ref{2.6}) in the same way as above into
two dimensions we get exactly the decomposition of the action
(\ref{2.1}) we are looking for, consisting of a topological term
($Q$--cocycle) and of a $Q$--exact term. Obviously, because the
maximal number of scalar supercharges of twisted $N = 16$, $D = 2$
super Maxwell theory is $N_T = 8$, the generator $Q$ must be a
certain linear combination of $Q^\alpha$ and $^\star Q^\alpha$.
This proves that the action (\ref{2.1}) is actually of Witten
type.

Up to now we have shown that the BRST complex of the twisted $N =
16$, $D = 2$ super Maxwell theory possesses actually a Hodge--type
structure. Moreover, we have verified that the cohomological
action is of Witten type and that it corresponds to the case with
the maximal number $N_T = 8$ of scalar supercharges and the
largest possible global symmetry group $SU(4)$. On the other hand,
we could also perform a topological twist of $N = 8$, $D = 2$
super Maxwell theory, whose underlying BRST complex possesses a
Hodge-type structure, too. In that case we would get the minimal
number of $N_T = 4$ scalar supercharges and the lowest possible
global symmetry group $SU(2)$ \cite{9}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\medskip
The topological action (\ref{2.1}) has still an ordinary gauge
symmetry, which we have not considered yet. Now, we want to show
that by adding to (\ref{2.1}) the usual gauge fixing and
(anti)ghost dependent terms the Hodge--type structure of the
underlying {\it basic} cohomology, i.e., the BRST complex
including also the ordinary gauge symmetry, is preserved. To this end
we introduce two $SU(4)$--quartets of Grassmann--odd
scalar ghost and antighost fields, $C^\alpha$ and
$\bar{C}_\alpha$, which transform as the fundamental and its
complex conjugate representation of $SU(4)$, respectively.

Then, the complete gauge--fixed action reads
\begin{equation}
\label{3.1}
S^{(N_T = 8)} = S_T^{(N_T = 8)} + \int_E d^2x\, \Bigr\{
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} \partial^\mu A_\mu \partial^\nu A_\nu +
\partial^\mu \bar{C}_\alpha \partial_\mu C^\alpha \Bigr\},
\end{equation}
where the topological action $S_T^{(N_T = 8)}$ is given in (\ref{2.1}).
This action, in spite of the fact that the gauge symmetry is fixed, exhibits
still an invariance under the following bosonic symmetry,
\begin{align}
\label{3.2}
&W^{\alpha\beta} A_\mu = - 2 \partial_\mu M^{\alpha\beta},
\nonumber
\\
&W^{\alpha\beta} M_{\gamma\delta} = - 4 \delta^\alpha_{~[\gamma}
\delta^\beta_{~\delta]} \partial^\mu A_\mu,
\nonumber
\\
&W^{\alpha\beta} \psi_\mu^\gamma = 2 i \epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}
( \partial_\mu \bar{\zeta}_\delta +
\epsilon_{\mu\nu} \partial^\nu \bar{\eta}_\delta ),
\end{align}
where we have written down only the non--vanishing transformation
rules. However, below it will be shown that the generator
$W^{\alpha\beta}$ of that symmetry is just the BRST Laplacian.
%i.e., the Casimir operator of the BRST complex.

Furthermore, in order to ensure the nilpotency of the BRST and
co--BRST operators, we introduce a set of auxiliary fields,
namely, the $SU(4)$--singlets of Grassmann--even scalar fields
$B$, $\bar{B}$ and $Y$, $\bar{Y}$. By the help of these additional
fields the action (\ref{3.1}) can be cast into the form
\begin{align}
\label{3.3}
S^{(N_T = 8)} = \int_E d^2x\, \Bigr\{&
\hbox{$\frac{1}{4}$} i \epsilon^{\mu\nu} B F_{\mu\nu}( A + i V ) -
\hbox{$\frac{1}{4}$} i \epsilon^{\mu\nu} \bar{B} F_{\mu\nu}( A - i V ) -
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} B \bar{B}
\nonumber
\\
& + \hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} i Y \partial^\mu ( A_\mu + i V_\mu ) -
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} i \bar{Y} \partial^\mu ( A_\mu - i V_\mu ) -
\hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} Y \bar{Y}
\phantom{\frac{1}{2}}
\nonumber
\\
& + \hbox{$\frac{1}{8}$} \partial^\mu M_{\alpha\beta}
\partial_\mu M^{\alpha\beta} -
\epsilon^{\mu\nu} \bar{\zeta}_\alpha \partial_\mu \psi_\nu^\alpha -
\bar{\eta}_\alpha \partial^\mu \psi_\mu^\alpha +
\partial^\mu \bar{C}_\alpha \partial_\mu C^\alpha \Bigr\},
\end{align}
and the Hodge--type $\star$--symmetry (\ref{2.2}) must be
supplemented by the following replacements,
\begin{equation}
\label{3.4}
\varphi \equiv \begin{bmatrix}
C^\alpha & \bar{C}_\alpha & &
\\
B & \bar{B} & Y & \bar{Y}
\\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\star \varphi = \begin{bmatrix}
- i C^\alpha & i \bar{C}_\alpha & &
\\
- \bar{B} & - B & - \bar{Y} & - Y
\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where, again, two successive $\star$--operations on $\varphi$
yield $\star (\star \varphi) = \pm \varphi$.

Let us now give the transformations rules for the generators of the basic
cohomology, which, just as in (\ref{1.2}), will be denoted by
$\Omega^\alpha$ (BRST operator), $^\star \Omega^\alpha =
\pm \star \Omega^\alpha \star$ (co--BRST operator) and $W^{\alpha\beta} =
\{ \Omega^\alpha, \,^\star \Omega^\beta \}$ (BRST Laplacian). Thereby,
$\Omega^\alpha$ and $^\star \Omega^\alpha$ include besides the shift and
co--shift symmetries, $Q^\alpha$ and $^\star Q^\alpha$, the
ghost--dependent ordinary gauge symmetries $\delta_G(C^\alpha)$ as well.
%
The transformation rules for the {\it off--shell} BRST symmetries
$\Omega^\alpha$ are
\begin{align}
&\Omega^\alpha A_\mu = \psi_\mu^\alpha +
\partial_\mu C^\alpha,
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha V_\mu = - i \psi_\mu^\alpha,
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha C^\beta = 0,
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha M_{\beta\gamma} = 2 i \delta^\alpha_{~[\beta}
\bar{\zeta}_{\gamma]},
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha \psi_\mu^\beta = - i \epsilon_{\mu\nu}
\partial^\nu M^{\alpha\beta},
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha \bar{\zeta}_\beta = i \delta^\alpha_{~\beta} B,
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha B = 0,
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha \bar{\eta}_\beta = i \delta^\alpha_{~\beta} Y,
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha Y = 0,
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha \bar{C}_\beta = \hbox{$\frac{1}{2}$} i
\delta^\alpha_{~\beta} ( Y - \bar{Y} ),
\nonumber
\\
&\Omega^\alpha \bar{B} = 0.
\end{align}
From combining $\Omega^\alpha$ with the Hodge--type
$\star$--symmetry (\ref{2.2}) and (\ref{3.3}) one gets the
corresponding transformation rules for the {\it off--shell}
co--BRST symmetries $^\star \Omega^\alpha$.

Then, for the non--vanishing transformations generated by the BRST Laplacian
$W^{\alpha\beta}$ one obtains
\begin{align*}
&W^{\alpha\beta} A_\mu = - 2 \partial_\mu M^{\alpha\beta},
\\
&W^{\alpha\beta} M_{\gamma\delta} = - 2 i \delta^\alpha_{~[\gamma}
\delta^\beta_{~\delta]} ( Y - \bar{Y} ),
\\
&W^{\alpha\beta} \psi_\mu^\gamma = 2 i \epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}
( \partial_\mu \bar{\zeta}_\delta +
\epsilon_{\mu\nu} \partial^\nu \bar{\eta}_\delta ),
\end{align*}
which, after elimination of $Y$ and $\bar{Y}$ through their
equations of motion, agree, as promised, with (\ref{3.2}). Let us
emphasize, that the BRST Laplacian $W^{\alpha\beta}$, in contrast
to \cite{1}, does {\it not} vanish on--shell. This is a
consequence of the fact that the topological nature of our model
is actually encoded in the shift and co--shift symmetries
$Q^\alpha$ and $^\star Q^\alpha$, and not in the vanishing of the
BRST Laplacian as in \cite{1}.

Furthermore, by a straightforward calculation it can be verified
that $\Omega^\alpha$ and $^\star \Omega^\alpha$ actually leave the
action (\ref{3.3}) invariant, i.e., it holds $(\Omega^\alpha,
\,^\star \Omega^\alpha) S^{(N_T = 8)} = 0$. Both operators,
together with $W^{\alpha\beta}$, satisfy the following BRST
complex,
\begin{gather*}
\{ \Omega^\alpha, \Omega^\beta \} = 0,
\qquad
W^{\alpha\beta} = \{ \Omega^\alpha, \,^\star \Omega^\beta \} \neq 0,
\qquad
\{ \,^\star \Omega^\alpha, \,^\star \Omega^\beta \} = 0,
\\
[ W^{\alpha\beta}, \Omega^\gamma ] \doteq 0,
\qquad
[ W^{\alpha\beta}, \,^\star \Omega^\gamma ] \doteq 0.
\end{gather*}
Obviously, this basic cohomology is analogous to the de Rham
cohomology: The both nilpotent BRST and co--BRST operators,
$\Omega^\alpha$ and $^\star \Omega^\alpha = \pm \star
\Omega^\alpha \star$, being interrelated by the duality
$\star$--operation, correspond to the exterior and the
co--exterior derivatives, $d$ and $\delta = \pm \star d \star$,
respectively, and the BRST Laplacian $W^{\alpha\beta} = \{
\Omega^\alpha, \,^\star \Omega^\alpha \}$ is the analogue of
$\Delta = \{ d, \delta \}$, so that we have indeed a perfect
example of a Hodge--type cohomological theory in two dimensions.

Summarizing, we have shown that, on--shell, the vanishing of the
BRST Laplacian of the Hodge theory proposed in \cite{1} can be
avoided, if we view the Maxwell action as the classical part of a
more involved cohomological action, which is obtained by a $N_T =
8$ topological twist of $N = 16$, $D = 2$ super Maxwell theory
with global symmetry group $SU(4)$. Then, the complete
gauge--fixed cohomological action is of Witten type and the
underlying basic cohomology is really of Hodge type. The non--Abelian case
will be presented elsewhere.
