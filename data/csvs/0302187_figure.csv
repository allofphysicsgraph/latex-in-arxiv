\caption{Integration contours in (\ref{B:eq:I3}) if $t_{23}>0$, indicated as 
oriented full lines. 
The thick black lines indicate the fixed cuts on the negative real axis 
and the grey lines indicate the moving
cuts which occur for $u-u'+\II v$ real negative. 
On the left the contour is shown
when one first integrates over $u$, with $\alpha =\frac{r_{13}^2}{2t_{13}}$
and $\beta=\frac{r_{23}^2}{2t_{23}}-v$. On the right one integrates first 
over $u'$, with $a=\frac{r_{23}^2}{2t_{23}}$ and 
$b=\frac{r_{13}^2}{2t_{13}}+v$.
