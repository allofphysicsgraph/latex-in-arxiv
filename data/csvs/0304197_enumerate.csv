$\zeta \rightarrow \infty$ as ${V_0 \rightarrow 0}$.
The kink
anti-kink separation tends to infinity, and as $R \rightarrow
\infty$, equation (\ref{ra}) can be satisfied with $n=1$ --- a
single kink. From equation (\ref{rel}) we see that
the energy goes to $2\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} V(T) dT$
if and only if $\zeta V_0\rightarrow 0$.

\item $\zeta \rightarrow$ const $\neq 0$ as ${V_0 \rightarrow 0}$.
Now the kink anti-kink distance tends to a constant (independently
of $R$) and one can never get an isolated kink.  As $R \rightarrow
\infty$, equation (\ref{ra}) can only be satisfied if $n
\rightarrow \infty$.  In this case (\ref{ener}) shows that that
are no finite energy solutions in the decompactified limit. For a
given finite $R$, $E$ is however finite. \item $\zeta \rightarrow
0$ as $V_0\rightarrow 0$.  For a fixed $R$, the limit
$V_0\rightarrow 0$ now leads to an array of infinitely many
singular kinks and anti-kinks (since their separation is $2
\zeta(0)$).  From (\ref{epsdef}) the energy (even for finite $R$)
is infinite. This is a rather problematic (and not very
meaningful) limit, but we will see that this behaviour occurs for
many potentials considered in the literature; for example $V(T) = v e^{-T^2}$.
