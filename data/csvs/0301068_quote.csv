We present a simple group representation analysis of massive, and 
particularly ``partially massless'', fields of arbitrary 
spin in de Sitter spaces 
of any dimension. 
The method uses bulk to boundary propagators to relate 
these fields to Euclidean conformal ones at one dimension lower.
These results are then used to revisit an old question:
can a consistent de Sitter supergravity be 
constructed, at least within its intrinsic horizon?
