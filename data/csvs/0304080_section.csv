\section{Generalities on one-dimensional wave equations} \label{appendix-generalities}

The notions of transmission and reflection coefficient for a one-dimensional wave equation are well known, at
least for real frequencies.  However, there are some subtleties associated with analytic 
continuation to complex frequencies.  Under fairly general conditions this analytic continuation does
exist; the questions are what its singularities are and whether we can construct it in a way which facilitates
explicit computation.

Suppose given a wave equation on the real line $-\infty < x < \infty$
with the form of \eqref{wave-equation},
\begin{equation} \label{wave-equation-repeated}
\left[ - \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x) - \omega^2 \right] \psi(x) = 0,
\end{equation}
where $V(x) \to 0$ faster than $1/\lvertx\rvert$ as $x \to \pm \infty$.
We can then define $T(\omega), R(\omega)$ for waves of real frequency $\omega \neq 0$
by fixing the boundary conditions 
\begin{equation}
\psi(x) \sim
\begin{cases}
T(\omega) e^{+i \omega x}  \label{transmission-boundary} & \textrm{\ as\ } x \to -\infty, \\
e^{+i \omega x} + R(\omega) e^{-i \omega x} & \textrm{\ as\ } x \to +\infty. 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The boundary conditions 
\eqref{transmission-boundary} also suffice to extend
$T(\omega)$ and $R(\omega)$ to 
complex-analytic functions on the lower half-plane $\textrm{Im\ } \omega < 0$.  Furthermore these functions
are nonsingular; there cannot be any poles because they would imply the existence 
of a normalizable solution to \eqref{wave-equation-repeated}
with complex $\omega$, which is impossible because of the self-adjointness of $- d^2/dx^2 + V(x)$.\footnote{This 
self-adjointness fails for non-normalizable $\psi(x)$, which formally explains the existence of quasinormal modes,
i.e. poles of $T(\omega)$ and $R(\omega)$ in the upper half-plane.}

It is not straightforward to define
$T(\omega)$ or $R(\omega)$ 
for $\omega$ in the upper half-plane, because in that case the boundary condition 
\eqref{transmission-boundary} as $x \to +\infty$ 
does not give a constraint on the solution; the solution $e^{+i \omega x}$ 
is exponentially small compared to $e^{-i \omega x}$ as $x \to +\infty$, so adding $e^{+i \omega x}$ 
with an arbitrary coefficient does not affect the asymptotics as $x \to +\infty$, and there is no way to
define what we mean by requiring this coefficient to be $1$.  In some cases we
can nevertheless analytically continue $T(\omega)$ to the upper half-plane; 
the existence and singularity structure of such a
continuation depend on the properties of $V(x)$.  We now turn to some examples.

The simplest possibility is $V(x) = 0$ for all $x$.  In this case
the prescription above gives simply $T(\omega) = 1, R(\omega) = 0$ for 
all $\omega$ in the lower half-plane, which has the obvious analytic 
continuation $T(\omega) = 1, R(\omega) = 0$ for all $\omega$.

Another possibility is that $V(x) \neq 0$ but $V(x)$ strictly vanishes as $x \to \pm \infty$ (e.g. a finite 
square well).  In that case, for any $\omega$, the solutions of \eqref{wave-equation-repeated} near $\pm \infty$ 
are strict 
linear combinations of $e^{\pm i \omega x}$.  Therefore $T(\omega)$ can be uniquely defined for any $\omega$ 
just by replacing the asymptotic relation $\sim$ by exact equality in \eqref{transmission-boundary}.  
This prescription defines $T(\omega)$ and $R(\omega)$ univalently for any $\omega \neq 0$, so $T(\omega)$ 
and $R(\omega)$ are single-valued, although they can have isolated singularities at $\omega = 0$ and in 
the upper half-plane.

A third possibility is that $V(x)$ admits analytic continuation to complex $x$ and furthermore 
$V(x) \to 0$ faster than $1 / \lvertx\rvert$ as $x \to \infty$ in any direction (e.g. $V(x) = 1/(x^2+1)$.)  
Note that this case and the one
just considered are mutually exclusive.  In this case we can define $T(\omega)$ by
setting our boundary conditions on the line $\omega x \in {\mathbb R}$ rather than $x \in {\mathbb R}$:
\begin{equation}
\psi(x) \sim \begin{cases}
T(\omega) e^{+i \omega x}  \label{transmission-boundary-complex} & \textrm{\ as\ } \omega x \to -\infty, \\
e^{+i \omega x} + R(\omega) e^{-i \omega x} & \textrm{\ as\ } \omega x \to +\infty. 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The advantage of \eqref{transmission-boundary-complex} over \eqref{transmission-boundary}
is that the solutions are oscillatory on the line $\omega x \in {\mathbb R}$ and hence the asymptotics \eqref{transmission-boundary-complex} determine $T(\omega)$ and $R(\omega)$.  
There is one additional complication:  if $V(x)$ has singularities along the line 
$\omega x \in {\mathbb R}$, then $\psi(x)$ will generally be 
multivalued, so we have to specify the contour along which we travel from one side of the line $\omega x \in {\mathbb R}$
to the other.  To make $T(\omega)$ and $R(\omega)$ holomorphic in $\omega$ the only option is to continuously
deform the contour by ``Wick rotation'' from the real axis; but then after a full $2 \pi$ rotation
the contour will hang on the singularities, so $T(\omega)$ and $R(\omega)$ are potentially 
multivalued.

Finally we come to the case which actually occurs for black hole transmission coefficients, say for $d=4$ Schwarzschild.
Here the analytic structure of $T(\omega)$ and $R(\omega)$ has been extensively studied because it is relevant for
the long time behavior of black hole perturbations; see in particular \cite{leaverbranchcut}.
In this case $V(x) = V[r(x)]$, with $r(x)$ defined implicitly by \eqref{tortoise-definition},
and while $V(r)$ is manifestly single-valued all over the complex $r$-plane,
$r(x)$ generally has multiple branches (because of the logarithm in \eqref{tortoise-definition}).
  So the analytic continuation of $V(x)$ is a multivalued 
function of $x$.  Nevertheless, since the only singularity of $V(r)$ occurs 
at $r=0$, the singularities of $V[r(x)]$ can only occur at
$x$ for which some branch of $r(x)$ has $r(x) = 0$, namely at $x = 2\pi i n$.  So $T(\omega)$, $R(\omega)$ can be
defined by Wick rotation of the $x$-plane contour to any $\omega$ with $\textrm{Re\ } \omega \neq 0$.  However, at $\textrm{Re\ }
\omega = 0$ we encounter an infinite chain of singularities and we have to choose which way to go around them;
our choice will depend on which way we made the Wick rotation (i.e. whether we are coming from $\textrm{Re\ } \omega > 0$ 
or $\textrm{Re\ } \omega < 0$).  $T(\omega), R(\omega)$ therefore have branch cuts at positive imaginary $\omega$.
In the body of the paper we compute these functions for $\omega$ on the right side of the cut, 
i.e. $\textrm{Re\ } \omega$ infinitesimally positive; in that case, after performing the Wick rotation in the $x$-plane, 
\eqref{transmission-boundary-complex}
corresponds to (see Figure \ref{r-plane} in Section \ref{section-transmission-schwarzschild-4d})
\begin{equation}
\psi(r) \sim
\begin{cases}
T(\omega) e^{+i \omega x} & \textrm{\ as\ } r \to r_H, \\
e^{i \omega x} + R(\omega) e^{-i \omega x} & \textrm{\ as\ } r \to \ensuremath{\bigstar}\xspace. \label{imaginary-transmission-boundary-repeated}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
If we had assumed $\textrm{Re\ } \omega < 0$ instead, we would have put \ensuremath{\bigstar}\xspace at the north of Figure \ref{r-plane} instead
of the south.



\section{Asymptotics of solutions to the wave equation} \label{appendix-asymptotics}

In our analysis of the solutions of \eqref{wave-equation} along the line $\textrm{Re\ } x = 0$ we need to 
know their asymptotics in the limit $\omega \to i \infty$.  In this limit the term $\omega^2$ dominates
the potential everywhere except 
near $r=0$, so we expect that the interesting behavior will occur there.
Near $r=0$ we have from \eqref{tortoise-definition}
\begin{equation}
x/r_H = r/r_H + \log (1-r/r_H) = -\ensuremath{\frac{1}{2}}(r/r_H)^2 - \frac{1}{3}(r/r_H)^3 + {\mathcal O}\left((r/r_H)^4\right)
\end{equation}
which can be inverted to obtain
\begin{equation}
r/r_H = \pm i \sqrt{2x/r_H} + 2x/3r_H + {\mathcal O}\left((x/r_H)^{3/2}\right)
\end{equation}
Substituting this in \eqref{wave-equation}, \eqref{schwarzschild-4d-potential} we obtain
the leading-order behavior of \eqref{wave-equation} near the $r=0$ singularity together
with its first correction:
\begin{equation} \label{wave-equation-singularity-corrected}
\left[ -\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \frac{j^2-1}{4x^2} \pm i \frac{\eta}{x^{3/2} \sqrt{r_H}} + {\mathcal O}\left((x r_H)^{-1}\right) - \omega^2) \right] \psi = 0,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation} \label{eta-definition}
\eta = \frac{(j^2 - 1) - 3l(l+1)}{6 \sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}
Further setting $\rho = \omega x$,
\begin{equation} \label{wave-equation-rho}
\left[ -\frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} + \frac{j^2-1}{4 \rho^2} \pm i \frac{\eta}{\rho^{3/2}\sqrt{\omega r_H}} + {\mathcal O}\left(\frac{1}{\rho \omega r_H}\right) - 1 \right] \psi = 0
\end{equation}
Integrating the subleading terms twice in $\rho$ shows they can at
worst give corrections where $\delta \psi / \psi$ scales as a power of $\rho/\omega r_H$.
Then in the $\omega \to i \infty$ limit with
$\rho \ll 1$, one may neglect this term as well as the constant term $1$
and write simply
\begin{equation}
\left[ \frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} + \frac{1-j^2}{4 \rho^2} \right] \psi = 0.
\end{equation}
So when $\rho \ll 1$ there are two possibilities for the asymptotics: 
\begin{equation} \label{small-rho-power-law}
\psi(\rho) \sim \rho^{(1 \pm j) /2}.
\end{equation}
It turns out that both possibilities occur and 
we can pick two linearly independent solutions $\psi_\pm$ by fixing their
rotation properties (at least for non-integer $j$):
\begin{equation} \label{solution-rotation}
\psi_\pm(e^{i \theta} \rho) = e^{(1 \pm j) i \theta / 2} \psi_\pm(\rho).
\end{equation}
On the other hand, for $1 \ll \rho$,
\eqref{wave-equation-rho} is simply
\begin{equation}
\left[ \frac{d^2}{d\rho^2} + 1\right] \psi = 0
\end{equation}
and so the solutions are asymptotic to free waves $e^{\pm i \rho}$.  The issue is now to
interpolate between these two regions.  To leading order in $\omega$ this
can be done by neglecting the $1/\sqrt{\omega}$ term in \eqref{wave-equation-rho};
one then finds that $\psi_\pm$ are asymptotic to $\sqrt{\rho} J_{\pm j/2}(\rho)$ in the region
$\rho \ll \lvert\omega\rvert r_H$, and since this region overlaps with the region 
$1 \ll \rho$ in the limit of large $\omega$, one can match the known 
asymptotics of Bessel functions to the free wave propagation.  
This was the approach taken in \cite{Motl:2003cd} and it gives for $1 \ll \rho$
\begin{equation} \label{solution-asymptotics}
\psi_\pm(\rho) \sim \cos(\rho - (1 \pm j)\pi / 4) + \ensuremath{{\mathcal O}\left(1/\sqrt{\lvert\omega\rvert r_H}\right)}\xspace.
\end{equation}
From \eqref{eta-definition}, \eqref{wave-equation-rho} we see that the \ensuremath{{\mathcal O}\left(1/\sqrt{\lvert\omega\rvert r_H}\right)}\xspace correction to
\eqref{solution-asymptotics} should be proportional to $(j^2-1) - 3l(l+1)$; in the case
$j=2$ this dependence 
was also found in \cite{MaassenvandenBrink:2003as}, where in addition the exact numerical coefficient
was evaluated.
