\item In the case of the single brane model by Randall \& Sundrum, 
the homogeneous cosmological evolution is well understood. An 
unsolved issue in this model, however, is a  complete understanding 
of the evolution of cosmological perturbations. The effects of the 
bulk gravitational field, encoded in the  projected Weyl--tensor, on  
CMB physics and Large Scale Structures are not known. The problem 
is twofold: first, the bulk equation are partial, non--linear differential 
equations and second, boundary conditions on the brane have to be imposed. 
The current formalism have not yet been used in order to tackle these problems
(for perturbations in brane world theories, see 
\cite{perturbationsfirst}-\cite{perturbationslast}; a short review on 
brane world perturbations is given in \cite{nathaliereview}).

\item Models with bulk scalar fields: Although we have presented some 
results on the cosmological evolution of a homogeneous brane, we assumed 
that the bulk scalar field does not strongly vary around the brane. Clearly, 
this needs to be investigated in some detail through a detailed investigation 
of the bulk equations, presumably with the help of numerical methods. Furthermore, 
for models with two branes, the cosmology has to be explored also in the high 
energy regime, in which the moduli--space approximation is not valid. Some exact 
cosmological solutions have been found in 
\cite{boundaryinflation} and \cite{skinner}.

\item Both the bulk scalar field as well as the interbrane distance in 
two brane models could play an 
important role at least during some part of the cosmological history. Maybe one 
of the fields plays the role of dark energy. In that case, it is only natural 
that masses of particles vary, as well as other parameter, such as the fine 
structure constant  $\alpha_{em}$ \cite{varyour}. Details of this interesting 
proposal have yet to be worked out.

\item The bulk singularity, which was thought to be shielded away with the help 
of a second brane, seems to play an important role in a cosmological setting. 
We have seen in section 5 that the negative tension brane moves towards 
the bulk singularity and eventually hits it. Therefore, cosmology forces us 
to think about this singularity, even if it was shielded with a second brane. 
Cosmologically, the brane might be 
repelled, which might be described by a potential. 
Alternatively, one might take quantum corrections into account in form of 
a Gauss-Bonnett term in the bulk \cite{gbfirst}-\cite{gblast}.

\item Brane collisions provide a different singularity problem in brane cosmology. 
String theory has to make progress in order to understand this singularity as well. 
From the cosmological point of view, the question is, if a transition between the 
brane collision can provide a new cosmological era and how cosmological perturbations 
evolve before and after the bounce \cite{bcpertfirst}-\cite{bcpertlast}.
