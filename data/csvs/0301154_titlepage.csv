{\large Abstract}

\vspace*{.8cm}

Recently it has been demonstrated by Dienes and Mafi that the physics of
toroidal compactified models of extra dimensions can depend on the shape 
angle of the torus.  Toroidal compactification has also recently been used 
as a regulator for numerical solutions of supersymmetric field theories in 
2+1 dimensions. The question is: does the shape angle of the torus also 
affect the physics in this situation?  Clearly a numerical solution should 
be independent of the shape of the space on which we compactify, at least
when the regulator is removed. We show that, for standard discrete light-cone
quantization with transverse parity invariance, toroidal compactification is
only allowed for a specific set of shape angles and for that set of shape 
angles the numerical solutions are unchanged.
