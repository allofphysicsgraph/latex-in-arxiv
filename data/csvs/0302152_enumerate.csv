\item A set of principal $U(1)$-bundles $T^g$, one for each
$g \in G$, and each possessing a flat $U(1)$ connection $\Lambda(g)$.
\item Connection-preserving maps $\omega^{g_1, g_2}: T^{g_2} \otimes g_2^* T^{g_1} \rightarrow
T^{g_1 g_2}$, such that the following diagram\footnote{
In writing diagram~(\ref{omegacocycle}), we refer to tensor products
of principal $U(1)$ bundles, which the reader has almost certainly
not seen before.  More properly, we can think about this as a tensor
product of abelian torsors, or, if the reader prefers, we can replace
the principal $U(1)$ bundles with line bundles with hermitian fiber metrics.
In either case, the result is the same:  the transition functions of
such a tensor product are the product of the transition functions of the
factors, and a connection can be formed on the tensor product via the
sum of the connections on either factor.
