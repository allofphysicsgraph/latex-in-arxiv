We discuss realizations of the $SL(2,R)$ current algebra in the 
hyperbolic basis using free scalar fields. It has been previously 
shown by Satoh how such a realization can be used to describe 
the principal continuous representations of $SL(2,R)$. We 
extend this work by introducing another realization that corresponds 
to the principal discrete representations of $SL(2,R)$. We show 
that in these realizations spectral flow can be interpreted 
as twisting of a free scalar field. Finally, we discuss how these 
realizations can be obtained from the BTZ Lagrangian.
