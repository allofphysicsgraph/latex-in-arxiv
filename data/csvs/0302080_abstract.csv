Traditional derivations of the Planck mass
ignore the role of charge and spin in general relativity. From the
Kerr-Newman null surface and horizon radii, quantized charge and spin dependence 
are introduced in an extended Planck scale of mass. Spectra emerge with 
selection rules dependent upon the choice of Kerr-Newman radius to link with the 
Compton wavelength. The appearance of the fine structure
constant suggests the possibility of a variation in time of the extended
Planck mass, which may be much larger than the variation in the
traditional one. There is a suggestion of a connection with the $\alpha$ value 
governing high-energy radiation in Z-boson production and decay.
