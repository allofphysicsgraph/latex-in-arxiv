0,"\begin{proof} Let $\alpha \in \mathfrak{G},$\ and consider the mapping 
$\gamma \longmapsto \gamma ^{\alpha }\equiv \alpha \gamma \alpha^{-1}$ of 
$\mathfrak{G}$\ onto itself. It is easily seen that this mapping is
bijective. Since $\mathcal{G}$\ is an invariant system ($a^{b}\in \mathcal{G}
$\ for every $a\in \mathcal{G}, b \in \mathfrak{G}$) $\mathcal{G}$\ will 
be mapped onto
itself, and if $P$\ is a point, so that $P=gh$\ with $g|h,$\ then 
$P^{\alpha}=g^{\alpha }h^{\alpha }$\ and $g^{\alpha }|h^{\alpha }$, so that 
$P^{\alpha }$ is also a point. Thus, $g\longmapsto g^{\alpha }$, 
$P\longmapsto P^{\alpha }$\ are one-to-one mappings of the set of lines and
the set of points, each onto itself in the group plane.

1,"\begin{proof} Since each line $d$\ of the metric plane is incident with at
least three points (Theorem 5 in \cite{BBPW}) and a point is of the form $ab$
with $a | b$, it follows that each $x\in\mathcal{G}$ is the axis of a 
pencil. From the uniqueness of perpendiculars (Theorem 4 \cite{BBPW}), 
each $x\in \mathcal{G}$\ corresponds in a one-to-one manner with the 
pencils $G(x)$. Hence, each $x\in \mathcal{G}$ corresponds in a one-to-one 
manner with the exterior points of the hyperbolic projective--metric plane.
\"
2,"\begin{proof} By Theorem 23 of \cite{BBPW}, any two pencils of lines of the
metric plane have at most one line in common. By A.6, each line belongs to at
least two pencils of parallels and by Theorem 13 of \cite{BBPW} and A.6 
again, each line $g\in \mathcal{G}$\ belongs to precisely two such pencils. 
Thus, a proper ideal line contains two points on the absolute, interior 
points, and exterior points. Hence, a proper ideal line is a secant line. 
A secant line is the set \newline
$g(c)=\{G(P),G(x),G(ab)_{\infty }:x,P\ |c$\ and $abc\in 
\mathcal{G}$\ where $a\parallel b\}$.
\"
3,"\begin{proof} Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the set of all points of $\Pi$ and 
$\mathcal{L}$ the set of all lines of $\Pi$. From the remarks above
it follows that $\Phi$ is a well-defined one-to-one point--to--line mapping
of $\mathcal{P}$ onto $\mathcal{L}$ and a well-defined one-to-one
line--to--point mapping of $\mathcal{L}$ onto $\mathcal{P}$. 

     Next, it is shown that $\Phi$ is a correlation and for this it 
suffices to show that $\Phi$ preserves incidence. Let 
$g(c)=\{G(P),G(x),G(ab)_{\infty }:x,P|c$ and $abc\in \mathcal{G}$
where $a\parallel b\}$ be a secant line. Let 
$G(A),G(B),G(d),G(ef)_{\infty }\in g(c),$ where 
$G(ef)_{\infty }=\{x\in \mathcal{G}:xef\in \mathcal{G}$ and 
$e\parallel f\}.$ Then $A,B,d|c$ and $cab\in \mathcal{G}.$ Now 
$\Phi(G(A))=g(A)=\{G(x):x|A\},$ $\Phi(G(B))=g(B)=\{G(x):x|B\},$ 
$\Phi(G(d))=g(d)$, and $\Phi(G(ef)_{\infty })= g(ef)_{\infty }=\{G(ef)_{\infty
}\}\cup \{G(x):efx\in \mathcal{G}\}.$ Thus, it follows that 
$\Phi(g(c))=G(c)\in g(A)\cap g(B)\cap g(d)\cap g(ef)_{\infty },$ so that 
$\Phi(g(c))\in \Phi(G(A)),\Phi(G(B)),\Phi(G(d)),\Phi(G(ef)_{\infty })$ 
and $\Phi$ preserves incidence on a secant line.

     Consider an exterior line $g(P)=\{G(x):x|P\}$, and let 
$G(a),G(b)\in g(P)$. Then $a,b|P$ and it follows that 
$G(P)\in g(a)\cap g(b)$, {\it i.e.} 
$\Phi(g(P))\in \Phi(G(a))\cap \Phi(G(b))$ and $\Phi$ preserves incidence
on an exterior line.

     Finally, let $g(ab)_{\infty }=\{G(ab)_{\infty }\}\cup \{G(x):abx\in 
\mathcal{G}$ where $a\parallel b\}$ be a tangent line. Clearly, since 
$\Phi(G(ab)_{\infty })=g(ab)_{\infty }$, one has 
$G(ab)_{\infty }\in g(ab)_{\infty }$. 
Now suppose that $G(d)\in g(ab)_{\infty }.$ Then $abd\in \mathcal{G}$ and
$\Phi(G(d))=g(d)=\{G(A),G(x),G(ef)_{\infty}:A,x|d$ and $def\in \mathcal{G}$ 
where $e\parallel f\}.$ Thus, $G(d)\in G(ab)_{\infty }\cap G(ef)_{\infty}$ 
and $G(ef)_{\infty }\in g(d)$, which implies that $G(d)\in g(ef)_{\infty}$ 
and $\Phi(g(ef)_{\infty })\in \Phi(G(d))$. Hence, $\Phi$
preserves incidence and is a correlation.
\"
4,"\begin{proof} Declaring a perpendicularity with respect to the
polarity defined above, one has, on the one hand, $g(c) \perp g(a)$ 
if and only if $\Phi(g(c))= G(c) \in g(a)$ and, on the other, 
$\Phi(g(a))= G(a)\in g(c)$ if and only if $a | c$. Similarly, one has
$g(c) \perp g(P)$ if and only if $\Phi(g(c))= G(c) \in g(P)$ if and
only if $c | P$. In addition, $g(P) \perp g(Q)$ if and only if 
$\Phi(g(P))=G(P)\in g(Q)$ if and only if $P | Q$. In fact, this is
excluded by Theorem 2.1(c) in \cite{BBPW}, in conformity with hyperbolic 
geometry, since two interior points cannot be conjugate under the 
hyperbolic polarity.

     Further, one sees that $G(C) \perp G(p)$ if and only if 
$G(C)\in \Phi(G(p))=g(p)$ and $G(p)\in \Phi(G(C))=g(C)$ if and only if 
$P | c$. Finally, one also has $G(c) \perp G(x)$ if and only if 
$G(c)\in \Phi(G(x))=g(x)$ and $G(x)\in g(c)=\Phi(G(c))$ if and only if
$x | c$.
\"
5,"\begin{proof} This follows from the earlier observation that the motions
of the group plane map pencils onto pencils preserving the ``$|""$\ relation.
\"
6,"\begin{proof} Recall that $g(b)=\{G(A),G(x),G(cd)_{\infty }:x,A$ $|b$
and where $b$ lies in the pencil $G(cd)_{\infty }\}$. For any $G(A)$
and $G(x)$\ in $g(b)$ one has $A^{b}=A$ and $x^{b}=x$, since $A,x$\ $|b$
and if $G(A),G(x)\notin g(b)$\ then 
$A,x \nmid b$ and $A^{b}\neq A,$\ $x^{b}\neq x,$ and 
$A^{b},x^{b}\nmid b$. Thus, $G(A)^{b},G(x)^{b}\notin g(b)$.

   Recall also that $G(cd)_{\infty} = \{f \mid fcd\in \mathcal{G},$
where $c$ and $d$ have neither a common point nor a common perpendicular $\}$. 
Now $g(b)$ is a secant line, so that it contains two such distinct points, 
$G(mn)_{\infty}$ and $G(pq)_{\infty }$, say, on the absolute. Since the
motions of the group plane map pencils onto pencils preserving the ``$|$''
relation it follows that if $c,d\in G(mn)_{\infty}$ then 
$c^{b},d^{b}\in G(mn)_{\infty }$ and hence, 
$G(mn)_{\infty}^{b}=G(mn)_{\infty }$ and $G(pq)_{\infty }^{b}=G(pq)_{\infty}$.
Moreover, if $G(rs)_{\infty }\notin g(b)$, then it follows that 
$G(rs)_{\infty }^{b}\notin g(b)$. Thus, $\Psi_{b}$ leaves $g(b)$
pointwise invariant.

     Let $g(d), g(Q)$, and $g(rs)_{\infty }$\ be a secant line,
exterior line, and tangent line, respectively, containing $G(b).$ For 
$G(e)\in g(d)$ one has $e$\ $|d$\ and $e^{b}\mid d^{b}=d$, since $b\mid d$,
thus $G(e)^{b}\in g(d)$. For $G(A)\in g(d)$, $A^{b}$\ $|d^{b}=d$, so 
$G(A)^{b}\in g(d)$. Similarly, it follows that if $G(ef)_{\infty }\in g(d)$
then $G(ef)_{\infty }^{b}\in g(d)$, and $g(d)^{b}=g(d)$. One easily
sees that $g(Q)^{b}=g(Q)$ and $g(rs)_{\infty }^{b}=g(rs)_{\infty }$.
Thus, $\Psi _{b}$ leaves every line through $b$ invariant and $\Psi_{b}$
is a perspective collineation for each $b\in \mathcal{G}$.
\"
7,"\begin{proof} Since $A^{b}$\ is again a point in the original group plane
and since $d^{b}$\ is again a line in the original group plane, 
it follows that, for each 
$b\in\mathcal{G}$, $\Psi _{b}$\ maps interior points to interior points,
exterior points to exterior points, points on the absolute to points
on the absolute, secant lines to secant lines, exterior lines to
exterior lines, and tangent lines to tangent lines.  Moreover, since
$(\xi^{b})^{b} = \xi$ for any $\xi \in \mathfrak{G}$, $\Psi_{b}$\ is
involutory for each $b\in \mathcal{G}$. But in a projective plane in
which the theorem of Pappus holds, the only collineations which are
involutory are harmonic homologies \cite{BK}. Thus $\Psi_{b}$ is a
harmonic homology for each $b\in \mathcal{G}$.
\"
8,"\begin{proof} Arguing in a similar manner, one sees that for each 
interior point $G(A)$, $\Psi_{A}$ is a harmonic homology with center 
$G(A)$ and axis $g(A)$, where $g(A)$ is the polar of $G(A)$,
$G(A)\notin g(A)$, and where $\Psi_{A}$ is defined analogously to 
$\Psi_{b}$. Thus, each $\Psi_{A}$ is a point reflection, and since 
$A$ is the product of two exterior points, one sees that point reflections 
about interior points are generated by reflections about exterior points.
\"
9,"\begin{proof} Consider a line reflection in the hyperbolic plane, {\it i.e.}
the harmonic homology with axis $g(b)$ and center $G(b)$. Let $G(A)$
be an interior point and $g(d)$ a line through $G(A)$ meeting $g(b)$.
Since $G(b)\in g(d)$, one has $b | d$ and $g(d)$ is orthogonal to $g(b)$.
Let $G(E)$ be the point where $g(b)$ meets $g(d)$. Since $G(E)\in g(b)$,
then $E | b$ and $Eb=f$ for some $f\in \mathcal{G}$. It follows
that the reflection of $G(A)$ about $g(b)$ is the same as the reflection
of $G(A)$ about $G(E)$. Since $b | d$ and $E|d$, then $bd=C$ and
one has $E,C | b,d$ with $b\neq d$. Thus, by A.2, $E=C=bd$. Hence,
$A^{E}=A^{db}$ and $A|d$ as $G(A)\in g(d) = A^{b}$.
\"
10,"\begin{proof} Since any motion in Minkowski space can be generated by a
suitable product of plane reflections, it suffices to show that reflections
about exterior points generate plane reflections.

     Let $\alpha$ be any Minkowski plane or spacelike plane (note that
reflections about characteristic planes and lightlike lines do not exist
since they are self-perpendicular or see \cite{BK}). Let $P$ be any point in
Minkowski space. Let $l$ be the line through $P$ parallel to $\alpha$.
Let $\alpha_{\infty }$ denote the section of $\alpha$ at infinity.
Applying the polarity to $\alpha_{\infty }$, one obtains a point 
$g_{\infty} \perp \alpha_{\infty }$. Let $g$ be a line through $P$ whose 
section at infinity is $g_{\infty}$, so that $g$ is a line through $P$
orthogonal to $\alpha$. Since each line in the plane at infinity contains
at least 3 points, there exists a line $l$ in $\alpha$ which is
orthogonal to $g$ as $g_{\infty} \perp \alpha_{\infty}$. Now let 
$m$ be a line through $P$ not in $\alpha$ which intersects $l$. It
follows that the reflection of $P$ about $\alpha$ is the same as
reflecting $m$ about $l$ and taking the intersection of the image of $m$
under the reflection with $g$. By the construction of the affine space and
the definition of orthogonality in the affine space, it follows that $l$ and 
$m$ must act as their sections at infinity act. Since any point reflection
in the hyperbolic projective--metric plane can be generated by reflections
about exterior points, it follows that the reflection of $P$ about $\alpha$
is generated by reflections of $P$ about spacelike lines.

11,"\begin{proof} In light of the assumed isotony of 
$\{ \Rs(\chi(i)) \}_{i \in I}$ and the Haag duality from 
Theorem \ref{mainqft}, it follows that if 
$\chi(j) \subset \chi(i)'$, then 
$\Rs(\chi(j)) \subset \Rs(\chi(i)') = \Rs(\chi(i))'$, {\it i.e.} the
net is local. The fact that the CGMA is
satisfied by $(\omega,\{ \Rs(\chi(i)) \}_{i \in I})$ is a trivial
consequence of the construction and isotony.
\"
12,"\begin{proof} In Section 5.2 of \cite{BDFS} are given sufficient 
conditions for the adjoint action of the modular unitaries
$\Delta_j^{it}$ upon the net constructed above to be implemented by
the specified Poincar\'e transformations. All of those conditions are
satisfied here with the possible exception that the adjoint action of
all modular unitaries may not act transitively upon the net and that
the conditions (ii) and (iii) of the CGMA in \cite{BDFS} may not
hold. However, in \cite{BFS2,F} it is shown that the former assumption
may be dropped. Furthermore, the role of conditions (ii) and (iii) in
\cite{BDFS} was to assure that the adjoint action of modular objects
was implemented by Poincar\'e transformations --- but this is assured
here by the construction above and the \msc. Hence, here these
assumptions may also be dropped.
