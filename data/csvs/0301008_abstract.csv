In the framework of chiral perturbation theory we demonstrate the
equivalence of the supersymmetric and the replica methods in the
symmetry breaking classes of Dyson index $\beta=1$ and $\beta=4$.
Schwinger-Dyson equations are used to derive a universal differential
equation for the finite volume partition function in sectors of fixed
topological charge, $\nu$. All dependence on the symmetry breaking
class enters through the Dyson index, $\beta$. We utilize this
differential equation to obtain Virasoro constraints in the small mass
expansion for all $\beta$ and in the large mass expansion for
$\beta=2$ with arbitrary $\nu$. Using quenched chiral perturbation
theory we calculate the first finite volume correction to the chiral
condensate demonstrating how, for all $\beta$, there exists a region
in which the two expansion schemes of finite volume chiral
perturbation theory overlap.
