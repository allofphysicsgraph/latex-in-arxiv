\item Only two of the three parameters $\eta_{in},\alpha,\beta$
which determine the  initial conditions are independent.

\item As in Eqs.~(\ref{e:def-theta}, \ref{e:def-z}), two pump
fields $s_1$ and $s_2$ yield the same potential $V_x$ in
Eq.~(\ref{e:x-eqn}). If $\eta_{in}$ is chosen such that the
contributions to the integrals from the lower boundary can be
neglected, changing $s$ from $s_1$ to $s_2$ transforms $\Tcos$
into $k^{-1}\Tsin$ and $\Tsin$ into $k\Tcos$.

\item If $s \propto \eta^\gamma$ is a pure power law and again the
contributions from the lower boundary can be neglected, $\Tcos
\propto \sqrt{k|\eta|}J_\nu(|k\eta|)$ and $\Tsin \propto
\sqrt{k|\eta|}Y_{-\nu}(|k\eta|)$, where $\nu = \gamma-1/2$ and
$J,~Y$ are Bessel functions.

\item  If it can be shown in the ekpyrotic model
\cite{Khoury:2001wf,Khoury:2001zk} where $0<q\ll 1$, that the
Bardeen potential passes regularly through the transition, this
model leads to a nearly scale invariant spectrum with $n=1-2q$.

\item In dilaton-driven string cosmology we have the opposite
situation. There, $q=1/2$ and it has generically been assumed that
$\zeta$ passes regularly through the transition. This has been
shown to be true to first order in $\alpha'$
in~\cite{Cartier:2001is}. Then the spectral index is $n=3+2q=4$
leading to a very blue spectrum of highly suppressed
perturbation~\cite{Brustein:1995kn}. If however $\Psi$ would be
regular, a red spectrum with $n=1-2q$ is obtained. This would mean
a fatal blow for dilaton-driven string cosmology, since the
perturbations then become very large in the radiation dominated
era: Since the Bardeen potential is large at the end of the
pre-big bang phase and since $ |C/R| \simeq (k\eta)^2|\Psi| \simeq
|\Psi|$ at Hubble crossing, the Weyl tensor becomes larger than
the background Riemann tensor at Hubble crossing. Even though the
Weyl tensor has constant amplitude on super-Hubble scales, the
decay of the Riemann tensor during expansion leads to a huge
increase in the ratio $ |C/R|$. This problem only affects red
spectra, since for blue spectra $ |C/R|$ at Hubble crossing is
always smaller than $|\Psi(k_m)| \simeq |C/R|$ evaluated at
$\eta=-\eta_s$ for $k=k_m$.
