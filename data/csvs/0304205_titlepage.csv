\begin{abstract}
In the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method,
we consider a problem of constructing local operators 
for two-dimensional quantum integrable models, 
especially for the lattice versions of 
the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger and sine-Gordon models. 
We show that a certain class of local operators can be
constructed from the matrix elements of the monodromy 
matrix in a simple way. They are closely
related to the quantum projectors
and have nice commutation relations 
with the half of the matrix elements of the
elementary monodromy matrix.
The form factors of these operators
can be calculated by using the standard
algebraic Bethe ansatz techniques.
