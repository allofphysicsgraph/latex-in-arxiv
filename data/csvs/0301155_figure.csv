    \caption{Additional terms to the potential of $F$ can turn the unstable
      potential from the Veneziano-Yankielowicz Lagrangian (left hand side) into
      an acceptable potential for dynamical $F$ (right hand side). If $F$ is
      auxiliary, the ground state is represented by the maximum of the
      Veneziano-Yankielowicz potential, if $F$ is dynamical the latter is
      represented by the minimum of the new potential.}
