Self--dual branes are closed branes with a $2N$--dimensional
worldvolume $M$, coupling in a $(4N+2)$--dimensional space--time
minimally to a chiral boson. More precisely we have the
equations
 \bea
dH&=&gJ\label{magn}\\
H&=&*H
\label{chiral},
 \eea
where the current $J$ is a $(2N+2)$--form, the $\delta$--function on $M$.
The magnetic and electric Maxwell equations are thus identified.

In writing an
action for this system  one has to face two problems; the first regards
the construction of a covariant action for the chiral boson, a problem
which is elegantly solved by the PST--approach \cite{PST}. The second
problem
regards the introduction of a potential $B$. Formally the PST--approach
furnishes the action
 \beq
\label{PST}
  I={1\over 2G}\int\left(H*H-{\cal H}_-*{\cal H}_-\right)-{g\over G}\int_M B,
 \eeq
where ${\cal H}_-=i_v(H-*H)$, and $v$ is the auxiliary
non--propagating PST--vector. This action leads to the equation of
motion $H=*H$, once one has solved the magnetic equation
(\ref{magn}) in terms of a potential. In principle we have now two
ways for doing so.

{\bf 1) Dirac--branes.} We can introduce a Dirac--brane for $M$,
with Poincar\'e--dual $C$,  and write $J=dC$. This gives
 $$
H=dB+gC,
 $$
and $B$ has the known singularities on $M$. Consequently the
Wess--Zumino term in the action $\int_M B=\int BJ$ is ill--defined, even
in this elementary case with only a minimal interaction. But since
formally $I$ gives rise to the correct $B$--equation of motion it may
nevertheless be meaningful to compute its Dirac--anomaly, i.e. its
response under a change of Dirac--brane. One has $C^\prime=C+dW$,
$B^\prime= B-gW$ where (see (\ref{transC})) $W$ is the $\delta$--function
on a manifold $T$ whose boundary is made out of the old and new
Dirac--branes. $I$ changes then by
 $$
 \Delta I={g^2\over G}\int WJ,
 $$
where the integral would count the number of intersections between
$M$ and $T$. But since $M$ is a submanifold of $T$  this integral
is ill--defined.

The situation can be saved by introducing a framing
regularization. We replace the surface $M$ in  $\int_M B$ with a
surface $M_\ve$ (and the current $J$ with $J_\ve$) obtained from
$M$ by displacing each point of $M$ by an amount $\ve$ in an
arbitrary direction. This gives instead of $\Delta I$
 $$
\Delta I_\ve={g^2\over G}\int WJ_\ve,
 $$
where the integral is now well--defined and integer. The
Dirac--brane is then unobservable if the charge is quantized as
$$
{g^2\over G}=2\pi n.
$$

One may ask if this simple regularization procedure could be
invoked also to regularize the self--interactions (\ref{nonlin}) of
a magnetic brane. This is not the case, for two reasons: first,
the terms in (\ref{nonlin}) are non--linear (quadratic) while the
equation of motion for a chiral boson ($H=*H$) is linear and, second, the
equation of motion itself is well--defined,
while the non--linear terms in (\ref{nonlin}) involve $B|_M$ and
are ill--defined.

{\bf 2) Chern--kernels.} We can introduce an odd Chern--kernel
such that $J=dK$ and write
 $$
 H=dB+gK.
 $$
In this case the potential is regular on $M$, the integral $\int_M
B$ is well--defined and we have only to worry about
$Q$--invariance. As we know, the pullback of $B$ changes according
to an $SO(2N+2)$--transformation, $\delta B|_M= -g\chi^1(a)$, and
this implies that $I$ carries the normal bundle gravitational
anomaly
$$
\delta I={g^2\over G}\int_M\chi^1(a),
$$
corresponding to the anomaly polynomial ${g^2\over G }\,\chi(f)$,
i.e. to the $SO(2N+2)$--Euler form. A consistent
dynamics requires then the cancellation of this classical anomaly,
for example by the quantum anomaly produced by chiral fields
localized on $M$.

In conclusion, for self--dual branes both possibilities --
Dirac--branes and Chern--kernels -- are available, and which one
has to be used depends on the physical content of the theory. In
the absence of quantum gravitational anomalies one would use
Dirac--branes together with a framing regularization and impose charge 
quantization, while in their
presence Chern--kernels can play a central role in their
cancellation upon choosing particular values for the charges. The
availability of this second possibility is indeed crucial for the
consistency, at the quantum level, of the situation considered in
the next section.

\section{$M2$--branes ending on $M5$--branes}

The effective action for closed $M5$--branes interacting with
closed $M2$--branes through eleven--dimensional supergravity  has
been constructed in \cite{LMT}; it employs a four--form
Chern--kernel for the $M5$--brane current and realizes the
cancellation of the residual $M5$--brane normal bundle anomaly, which is an
$SO(5)$--anomaly. The $M2$--brane carries an odd--dimensional
worldvolume and entails no anomalies; it is moreover closed, so
the coupling to the $M5$--brane could be performed in a standard
way introducing a Dirac--three--brane, as explained in section two
of the present paper, and the dynamics is quantum mechanically
consistent if charge quantization holds.

But in eleven--dimensional space--time an $M2$--brane can have
also an open worldvolume, under the condition that its boundary
belongs to an $M5$--brane \cite{m2m5}; in this respect
$M5$--branes can be really considered as Dirichlet--branes for
eleven--dimensional membranes, as pointed out in \cite{dbranes}.
The principal differences w.r.t to closed $M2$--branes are the
following; first, for open membranes no natural Dirac--brane can
be defined (and no one is needed); second, the boundary of the
membrane is a string describing a two--dimensional worldvolume and
as such it is plagued by gravitational anomalies \cite{Mourad};
third, since open membranes must end on 5--branes the interaction
between the two surfaces is more intricate then in the closed case
where the relative position of the two surfaces is arbitrary; the
open membrane exhibits instead a contact--interaction with the
5--brane and this leads a priori to additional singularities
located at its boundary. The boundary of the membrane couples,
moreover, minimally to the chiral two--form present on the
5--brane and so it becomes actually a self--dual string.

We will show that all these problematic features are naturally and
elegantly solved by the Chern--kernel approach, if the $M2$--brane
charge $e$ and the $M5$--brane charge $g$ assume their $M$--theory
values
 \beq\label{minimal}
g^3=2\pi G,\quad e=g^2,
 \eeq
leading for the brane tensions to the standard relations
\cite{tensioni1;X8,tensioni2}
 $$
 T_g^3 ={2\pi\over G^2}, \quad T_e=G\,T_g^2.
 $$

The results of the present section are summarized in the
Wess--Zumino action (\ref{l12}), based on an odd and an even
Chern--kernel, which cancels the quantum gravitational anomalies
of the system.



\subsection{Normal bundles and quantum gravitational anomalies}

Calling the $M2$--brane worldvolume $M_3$, its boundary $M_2$ and
the $M5$--brane worldvolume $M_6$ we have
 \beq
 \label{ending}
 \pa M_3=M_2 \subset M_6, \quad \pa M_6=0=\pa M_2.
 \eeq

On the $M5$--brane the eleven--dimensional Lorentz group
$SO(1,10)$ reduces to the structure group
 \beq\label{struct}
SO(1,5)\times SO(5),
 \eeq
where $SO(1,5)$ is its tangent group and $SO(5)$ the invariance
group of its normal bundle. Since there are chiral fields
localized at $M_6$, i.e. the chiral two--form potential $b$ and
the 32--component Green--Schwarz spinor $\vartheta$ of $SO(1,10)$,
the structure group is plagued by gravitational anomalies. The
associated $M5$--brane eight--form anomaly polynomial can be
rewritten as the sum \cite{Witten},
 \beq\label{m5anom}
2\pi\left(I_8|_{M_6}+{1\over 24}P_8\right),
 \eeq
where $P_8(f)$ is the second Pontrjagin form of the normal bundle
$SO(5)$--curvature $f$, and $I_8(R)$ is the polynomial of the
target--space $SO(1,10)$--curvature $R$, which corrects eleven--dimensional
supergravity by the term $\int BI_8$ \cite{tensioni1;X8}. Clearly,
since $I_8|_{M_6}$ can be written in terms of normal and tangent
curvatures, the $SO(1,5)$--tangent bundle is anomalous as well.

On $M_2\subset M_6$ the structure group (\ref{struct}) reduces further
according to
 \bea\nonumber
SO(1,5)&\rightarrow& SO(1,1)\times SO_a(4) \\
SO(5)&\rightarrow & SO_b(4),\nonumber
 \eea
where $SO_a(4)$ is the normal group of $M_2$ with respect to $M_6$, and
$SO(1,1)$ is its tangent group.
The reduction of $SO(5)$ to $SO_b(4)$ occurs along the component normal to
$M_6$ of the {\it unique} direction on
$M_2$ which is normal to $M_2$ and tangent to $M_3$.
In conclusion, the structure group on $M_2$ is
$$
SO(1,1)\times SO_a(4)\times SO_b(4).
$$
The Green--Schwarz spinor reduces on $M_2$ to a set of fermions
which are chiral w.r.t this group and they give therefore
rise to gravitational anomalies; the corresponding four--form
anomaly polynomial has been determined in \cite{Mourad} and reads
\footnote{With respect to reference \cite{Mourad} we added a
factor of 1/2 since the Green--Schwarz fermion is Majorana.}
 \beq\label{m1anom}
\pi\left(\chi_b-\chi_a\right),
 \eeq
where $\chi_{a,b}$ are the Euler--forms of the
$SO_{a,b}(4)$--bundles. Notice in particular that the
$SO(1,1)$--tangent bundle is anomaly free.

A consistent low energy effective action for the system $M2+M5$
must therefore cancel simultaneously the anomaly (\ref{m5anom})
supported on $M_6$, and the anomaly (\ref{m1anom}) supported on
$M_2$.

\subsection{Currents, Chern--kernels and equations of motion}

In this section we have to distinguish target--space forms,
defined in eleven--dimensional space--time, from forms defined
only on $M_6$. Generically we will indicate the former with capital
letters and the latter with small letters. One has to take some care
when considering products of forms which are defined on different
manifolds. Indeed, in general the formal product $\phi_1 \phi_2$
between forms defined on different manifolds does not define a
form, but it defines a form say on $M_2$ if $\phi_2$ is the
$\delta$--function on $M_1$ w.r.t. $M_2$ and $\phi_1$ is a form on
$M_1$, see \cite{LMT,CL}.

We indicate the Poincar\'e--duals of $M_6$, $M_3$ and $M_2$
respectively with $J_5$, $J_8$ and $J_9$, where the subscripts
indicate the degrees of the forms. Since $M_2$ is a submanifold of 
$M_6$ we can also define the Poincar\'e--dual of $M_2$ w.r.t. to $M_6$:
this is a four--form on $M_6$ which we indicate with
$j_4$. Then the relations (\ref{ending}) translate into
 \beq\label{currents}
 dJ_8=J_9,\quad j_4J_5=J_9,\quad dJ_5=0=dj_4.
 \eeq

The starting point for the construction of the bosonic effective
action for $D=11$ supergravity  interacting with $M2$-- and
$M5$--branes is a set of consistent equations of motion for the
physical fields of the system. These are the space--time metric
and a three--form potential $B$ in the target--space $M_{11}$, the
coordinates and a (Born--Infeld like) chiral two--form $b$ on
$M_6$, and the coordinates on $M_3$. Concentrating on the dynamics
of the potentials $b$ and $B$ and calling their field--strengths
$h$ and $H$ respectively we can write their Bianchi identities
(magnetic equations) and equations of motion as
 \bea\label{1}
dH&=&gJ_5\\
d*H&=&{1\over 2}\,HH+g\,h\,J_5+g^2I_8 +eJ_8\label{2}\\
dh&=&dB|_{M_6}+{e\over g}\,j_4\label{3}\\
h&=&*\,h+{\rm (n.l.t.)},\label{4}
 \eea
where the non--linear terms in the self--duality equation for $h$
(\ref{4}) correspond to the Born--Infeld lagrangian, see the next section.
The form of these equations is almost uniquely fixed by the
requirement of generalized charge conservation for $H$, i.e. by
the requirement that the r.h.s. of (\ref{2}) is a closed form
\footnote{Our differential acts from the right: $d(\Phi_m\Phi_n)=
\Phi_md\Phi_n+(-)^nd\Phi_m \Phi_n$.}. However, to check this
closure one must first express $H$ and $h$ in terms of $B$ and
$b$, solving (\ref{1}) and (\ref{3}). According to the strategy
developed in this paper we introduce an even $SO(5)$ four--form
Chern--kernel $K$ for $J_5$, a target--space form, and an odd
$SO_a(4)$ three--form Chern--kernel
$k$ for $j_4$ \footnote{Remember that $SO_a(4)$ is indeed the normal
group of $M_2$ with respect to $M_6$.}, a form on $M_6$:
$$
J_5=dK,\quad j_4=dk.
$$
The $SO(5)$--kernel is written explicitly in (\ref{k4}) and the
$SO_a(4)$--kernel is just the sum of (\ref{omega}) and
(\ref{chernsimons}). The choice of a Chern--kernel for $j_4$,
instead of a Dirac--brane, is advisable because $M_2$ is a
self--dual string plagued by quantum gravitational anomalies, [see
(\ref{m1anom})]. On the other hand, the presence of the products
$hJ_5$ and $HH$ in (\ref{2}) forbids the use of Dirac--branes
also for $J_5$: the first term contains $BJ_5$ and $dbJ_5$, see
(\ref{nonlin}), and the second term, using a Dirac--brane $C_g$
instead of the Chern--kernel $K$, would contain a term $C_gC_g$,
which is the square of a $\delta$--function.

The field strengths read then
 \bea
 H&=&dB+gK\\
 h&=&db+B|_{M_6}+{e\over g}\,k.
 \eea
With these determinations, using (\ref{currents}) and the product
formulae for even Chern--kernels of section three, it is
straightforward to verify that (\ref{2}) closes.

Since $k$ is odd, under an $SO_a(4)$--transformation on $M_2$ we have,
as remnant of the $Q$--transformation of $b$, the anomalous
transformation law
 \beq\label{anomb}
 \delta b|_{M_2}=-{e\over g}\,\chi_a^1.
 \eeq


\subsection{Anomaly free effective action}

We write the effective action for our system as
$$
\Gamma={1\over G}\left(S_{kin}+S_{wz}\right) +\Gamma_q,
$$
where $\Gamma_q$ is the quantum effective action carrying the
anomalies (\ref{m5anom}) and (\ref{m1anom}), and the classical
action $S_{kin}+S_{wz}$ must by definition give rise to the
equations of motion (\ref{2}) and (\ref{4}). The kinetic terms are
the standard ones,
 \beq\label{kin}
 S_{kin}=\int_{M_{11}} d^{11}x\sqrt{-g}\,R-{1\over
2}\int_{M_{11}}H*H -g\int_{M_6}d^6\sigma\sqrt{-g}\,{\cal
L}(h)-e \int_{M_3}d^3\sigma\sqrt{-g},
 \eeq
where ${\cal L}(h)$, made out of the Born--Infeld Lagrangian
(written in a manifestly
covariant way a la PST \cite{dbipst}, see subsection 6.1),
contains the kinetic terms for the $M5$--brane coordinates as well
as for $b$. Here it suffices to know that it depends on $b$
only through the invariant field strength $h$.

The Wess--Zumino term is written usually as the integral of an
eleven--form; here we choose the equivalent alternative to write
it as the integral of a closed twelve--from on a
twelve--dimensional manifold with boundary,
$$
S_{wz}=\int_{M_{11}}L_{11}=\int_{M_{12}}L_{12},\quad\quad
L_{12}=dL_{11}, \quad\quad\pa M_{12}=M_{11}.
$$
We are here assuming the absence of topological obstructions. One
advantage of this procedure is the manifest invariance of $L_{12}$
under all relevant symmetries, while usually $L_{11}$ is invariant
only up to a closed form. This approach requires to extend the
target--space fields to ${\bf R}^{12}$, and in particular to
extend every involved $p$--brane to a $(p+1)$--brane whose
restriction on $M_{11}$ reduces to the $p$--brane \cite{LMT}.
Closed branes extend to closed branes, and the boundary of the
extended $M2$--brane has to belong to the extended $M5$--brane.
This procedure maintains then the degrees of the current--forms
$J_5$, $J_8$ etc. and hence of the Chern--kernels and of the
dimensions of the normal bundles. With an abuse of language we
indicate the extended worldvolumes still with their
eleven--dimensional names, e.g. $M_6$, even if it is now a
six--brane with a seven--dimensional worldvolume.

The crucial ingredient of this construction is then the
twelve--form
 \bea\nonumber
L_{12}&=&{1\over 6}\,HHH+{g\over 2}\,h\,dB J_5+g^2I_8H
      +g^3\left(I_7^0 +{1\over 24}\,P_7^0\right)J_5\\
      && +\,e\,HJ_8+{e\over 2}\left(db+B+g\,\chi_b^0\right)J_9,
\label{l12}
 \eea
where we introduced the canonical Chern--Simons forms: $I_8=dI_7^0$,
$P_8=dP_7^0$, $\chi_b=d\chi^0_b$.
This formula is the unique solution to the following three
requirements:
\par\noindent 1) It must give rise to the equations of motion
(\ref{2}) and (\ref{4}).
\par\noindent 2) It must be closed.
\par\noindent 3) It must be $Q$--invariant in the bulk, i.e. apart from
terms supported on the branes.

The equations of motion fix indeed all terms in $L_{12}$ which depend
on $B$ or $b$. The terms which are independent of these fields are
fixed by the requirements 2) and 3).
The formula is, actually, manifestly invariant under $Q$--transformations
of $B$: this potential shows up in the combination $H$ or as $B|_{M_6}$ and
both are invariant. The potential $b$ shows up as  $h$, which is invariant,
and as $dbJ_9$ which transforms by an $SO_a(4)$--transformation according
to (\ref{anomb}). Eventually, the terms
$g^3\left(I_7^0 +{1\over 24}\,P_7^0\right)J_5$ and ${ge\over 2}\,\chi_b^0J_9$
are needed to make $L_{12}$ a closed form, as can be seen using
-- before differentiation -- the product formulae of section three
\footnote{That $L_{12}$ is closed for $e=0$,
i.e. in the absence of $M2$--branes, has been shown in \cite{LMT}.}.
The unique non trivial point, in checking that $dL_{12}=0$, is to show that
{\it there exists a three--form $X$ on $M_3$} such that \footnote{This relation
requires the consistency condition $d\,(KJ_8)={1\over 2}\,\chi_b\,J_9$, which
is indeed true, but to prove it one can not use naively Leibnitz's rule, see
appendix  $B$.}
\beq
\label{ll11}
KJ_8+{1\over 2}\,\chi_b^0\,J_9=d\,(X J_8).
 \eeq
A proof of this relation, together with an explicit expression for $X$,
are reported in appendix $B$. For our purposes the defining
relation (\ref{ll11}) is sufficient, because it determines all
properties of $XJ_8$ modulo a closed form.

Another important point regarding $L_{12}$ is that the
Chern--Simons forms $P_7^0$ and $\chi_b^0$ appear evaluated
respectively on the worldvolumes $M_6$ and $M_2$, so that no
unphysical extensions of the $SO(5)$-- and
$SO_b(4)$--connections show up.

Eventually we can also give an explicit expression for the
Wess--Zumino action, written in eleven--dimensional space
($dL_{11}=L_{12}$),
 \bea
\label{l11}
 L_{11}&=&{1\over 6}\,BdBdB +{g\over 2}\,BdBK
 -{g\over 2}\,b\left(dB+{e\over g}\,j_4\right)J_5
+g^2B\left(I_8+{1\over 2}KK\right) \nonumber\\
 &&+e\,B\left(J_8+{1\over 2}\,k\,J_5\right)
+ g^3\left(I_7^0+{1\over 24}(P_7^0+Y_7)\right)K +eg\,XJ_8,
 \eea
where the invariant form $Y_7$ is defined in (\ref{y}) -- see
\cite{LMT} for an explicit expression --  and we recall that
$KK={1\over 4}d(P_7^0+Y_7)$.
The $b$--dependence of $L_{11}$ is fixed by the
Bianchi identity (\ref{3}) and by the PST--symmetries or,
equivalently, by the equation of motion (\ref{4}). To derive the
$B$--equation of motion (\ref{2}) from ${1\over
G}\left(S_{kin}+\int_{M_{11}}L_{11}\right)$, the only non trivial
point is the knowledge of the variation of the Born--Infeld action
under a generic variation of $B$; taking advantage from (\ref{4})
one obtains \cite{dbipst},
$$
\delta\int_{M_6}d^6\sigma\sqrt{-g}\,{\cal L}(h)= {1\over 2}
\int_{M_6} h\,\delta B= -{1\over 2} \int_{M_{11}} hJ_5\,\delta B.
$$
The integral $\int L_{11}$ is clearly also invariant under the
ordinary gauge transformations
$$
\delta B=d\Lambda, \quad \delta b=d\lambda -\Lambda|_{M_6}.
$$

\subsection{$Q$--invariance and gravitational anomalies}

The terms in $L_{11}$ which are not fixed by the equations of
motion are the ones multiplying $g^3$ and $eg$ in the second line
of (\ref{l11}); they are indeed crucial to establish
$Q$--invariance of the Wess--Zumino action and they introduce, in
turn, gravitational anomalies.

The invariance under $Q$--transformations for $B$ of the
Wess--Zumino action in its eleven--dimensional form is less
obvious than in its manifestly invariant twelve--dimensional form;
for $e=0$ this invariance has been explicitly verified in
\cite{LMT}, proving the necessity of the $g^3$--terms. The
necessity of the term $eg XJ_8$ is again a consequence of
this invariance; under
 $$
K\rightarrow K+dQ,\quad B\rightarrow B-gQ,
 $$
concentrating on the terms proportional to $e$ in $L_{11}$, one is left
with the $Q$--variation
 $$
\Delta \left(e BJ_8\right)=-eg QJ_8,
 $$
which should cancel against the variation of $eg XJ_8$.
The transformation property of $X$ can be deduced from
its defining relation (\ref{ll11}),
 $$
d \left(\Delta X J_8\right)=dQJ_8=d(QJ_8)-QJ_9=d(QJ_8),
 $$
where $QJ_9$ vanishes because $Q$ vanishes on $M_6$, and hence also
on $M_2$. This gives
 \beq\label{XQ}
\Delta \int_{M_{11}} XJ_8 =\int_{M_{11}}QJ_8,
 \eeq
 and
 $$
\Delta\int_{M_{11}}\left(eBJ_8 +eg XJ_8\right)=0.
 $$
This proves that $XJ_8$ is necessary to restore
$Q$--invariance of $S_{wz}$. On the other hand, (\ref{ll11})
implies also that under $SO_b(4)$--transformations one has
 $$
 d(\delta XJ_8) =-{1\over 2}d(\chi_b^1\,J_9),
 $$
and therefore
 \beq
 \label{anoml11}
 \delta\int_{M_{11}}(egXJ_8) =-{eg\over 2}\, \int_{M_2}\chi_b^1,
 \eeq
which represents a gravitational anomaly.

Under $Q$--transformations of $b$ (see (\ref{anomb}))
 $$
k\rightarrow k+dq,\quad b\rightarrow b -{e\over g}\,q,
\quad q|_{M_2}=\chi_a^1,
 $$
the Wess--Zumino action is invariant up to a gravitational
anomaly, as can be seen by direct inspection,
 \beq\label{anoma}
  \delta \int_{M_{11}}L_{11}={e^2\over 2g}\int_{M_2}\chi_a^1.
 \eeq

Eventually one can compute the gravitational anomalies carried by the
Wess--Zumino action. Using (\ref{l12}) and (\ref{anomb}) (or (\ref{l11}),
(\ref{anoml11}) and (\ref{anoma})) one sees that there are anomalies
supported on $M_6$ and $M_2$,
 \beq\label{anom}
\delta \left({1\over G}\,S_{wz}\right) =-{g^3\over
G}\int_{M_6}\left(I_6^1+{1\over 24}\,P_6^1\right)-{eg\over
2G}\int_{M_2}\left(\chi_b^1-{e\over g^2}\,\chi_a^1\right).
 \eeq
These classical anomalies cancel just against the quantum ones,
(\ref{m5anom}) and (\ref{m1anom}), if the charges satisfy
(\ref{minimal}).

We may rephrase this result as follows. Once we have introduced
the Chern--kernels $K$ and $k$, it is straightforward to write a ``minimal''
classical action which gives rise to the equations of motion
(\ref{2}) and (\ref{4}), since all terms depending on $B$ and $b$ are fixed.
This action is
${1\over G}\left(S_{kin}+\int {\widetilde L}_{11}\right)$,
where ${\widetilde L}_{11}$ is given in (\ref{l11}) but without the terms
in $g^3$ and $eg$. This would lead to the total effective action
(classical + quantum)
$$
{\widetilde \Gamma}={1\over G}\left(S_{kin}+\int {\widetilde L}_{11}\right)
 +\Gamma_q.
$$
Since ${1\over G}\int {\widetilde L}_{11}$ carries already the
$SO_a(4)$--anomaly polynomial $\pi \chi_a$ on $M_2$, the effective action
${\widetilde \Gamma}$ is plagued by the gravitational anomalies
$2\pi\left(I_8+{1\over 24}P_8\right)$ on $M_6$ and $\pi \chi_b$ on $M_2$,
but also by $Q$--anomalies.
What we have shown in this paper is the non--trivial fact that there
exists the counterterm
 $$
2\pi\int_{M_{11}}\left(I_7^0+{1\over 24}(P_7^0+Y_7)\right)K
+2\pi \int_{M_3}X,
 $$
which {\it cancels the gravitational  and $Q$--anomalies simultaneously}.

The values (\ref{minimal}) for the charges,
which ensure anomaly cancellation, satisfy in particular the
Dirac--quantization condition $eg=2\pi nG$ with $n=1$; this is,
actually, a remarkable coincidence since the Dirac--quantization
results in general from an unobservability--requirement of the
Dirac--brane, but in the present case no Dirac--brane at all was
introduced, because the $M2$--brane has a boundary.
The physical meaning of this coincidence can be traced back to the
limiting case in which the open $M2$--brane becomes a closed one
and leaves the $M5$--brane. Since the $M2$--charge remains
unchanged during this process and since a closed $M2$--brane is
consistent if its charge satisfies the Dirac--quantization
condition, one expects that our Wess--Zumino action for an open
membrane reduces to the one of a closed one, if the boundary of
the membrane shrinks to zero. In particular, in this limit a
Dirac--brane for $M2$ should in turn appear. This happens, indeed, as
follows. As the $M2$--brane closes one has to take simultaneously
the limits
$$
j_4\rightarrow 0,\quad J_9=dJ_8\rightarrow 0,\quad k\rightarrow 0.
$$
The field strength $h$ reduces to $db+B|_{M_6}$, and the unique
contribution of order $e$ surviving in (\ref{l12}) is $eHJ_8$. It
contributes to the classical action with
 $$
S_e={e\over G}\int_{M_{12}}HJ_8.
 $$
Since the membrane is now closed, $dJ_8=0$, we can introduce a
Dirac--brane and write $J_8=dC_e$. Using $eg=2\pi G$ the
interaction above can then be rewritten as
 $$
S_e={e\over G}\int_{M_{11}}HC_e+2\pi\int_{M_{12}}J_5C_e.
 $$
The second term is an (irrelevant) integer multiple of $2\pi$ and
the first term reproduces the standard interaction between closed
branes and dual branes, see (\ref{I2}). The integral $\int L_{11}$ reduces
correspondingly to the Wess--Zumino action for interacting closed $M2$--
and $M5$--branes, constructed in \cite{LMT}.

\section{$B_3\leftrightarrow B_6$ duality--invariant action}

In this section we present a classical action, equivalent to the
one constructed in the previous section, which involves the
three--form potential $B$ -- now we call it $B_3$ and the field
strength $H_4=dB_3+gK$ -- and its dual six--from potential $B_6$,
in a duality symmetric and manifestly Lorentz--invariant way. For
the problems regarding such a construction when one uses
Dirac--branes instead of Chern--kernels see reference \cite{bbs}.
The knowledge of a consistent duality--invariant action may be
useful for various purposes, for example for the investigation of
the flux quantization conditions of the dual curvature $H_7$, or
for an analysis of dimensional reductions involving dual branes
and dual potentials. Eventually such an action allows
also a comparison with the $M5$--brane $\sigma$--model action
\cite{prl,schwarz} (where the supergravity  fields are treated
as source--less i.e. they satisfy the equations of motion of pure
supergravity), because also the construction of the $\sigma$--model action
involves necessarily $B_3$ as well as $B_6$.

\subsection{PST--action for $b$}

We rewrite the classical action of the previous section
(disregarding the kinetic terms for the metric and for the
$M2$--brane, which are irrelevant for the present purposes)
 \beq\label{action}
 S_0[B_3,b,c]=-{1\over 2}\int_{M_{11}}H_4*H_4 -g\int_{M_6}d^6\sigma\sqrt{-g}
\,{\cal L}(h)+\int_{M_{11}}L_{11}.
 \eeq
In this subsection
we review briefly the basic ingredients of the PST--approach for the
self--interacting chiral two--form $b$ \cite{dbipst}, specifying 
in particular the lagrangian ${\cal L}(h)$. One introduces
an auxiliary scalar field $c(\sigma)$ on $M_6$, and constructs
the unit vector
 $$
 v_i={\pa_i c\over \sqrt{\pa c\,\pa c}},\quad v^iv_i=1.
 $$
Then one can define two  two--forms on $M_6$, contracting $h$ and $*h$ with
this vector:
 $$
{\cal H}\equiv i_vh,\quad \widetilde {\cal H}\equiv i_v*h,
\quad h=-(v{\cal H}+*v\widetilde {\cal H}),
 $$
where $v$ is the one--form $dc/\sqrt{\pa c\,\pa c}$.
In terms of these data one has
 $$
{\cal L}(h)={\cal L}_{BI}(\widetilde {\cal H}) -
{1\over 4}{\cal H}^{ij}\widetilde {\cal H}_{ij},
\quad
{\cal L}_{BI}(\widetilde {\cal H})=
\sqrt{det(\delta_i{}^j+i\widetilde {\cal H}_i{}^j)},
 $$
and the precise form of the equation of motion (\ref{4}) is
 \beq
\label{precise}
{\cal H}={\cal W}(\widetilde {\cal H})\equiv d\sigma^id\sigma^j\,
{\delta{\cal L}_{BI}\over\delta \widetilde {\cal H}^{ij}}.
 \eeq
Since we have ${\cal W}(\widetilde {\cal H})=\widetilde {\cal H}
+o(\widetilde {\cal H}^3)$, and
${\cal H}=\widetilde {\cal H}$ is the same as $h=*h$, (\ref{precise}) is
indeed a non--linear version of $h=*h$.
After fixing the PST--symmetries, see below, the action $S_0$
gives rise to (\ref{precise}). This equation of motion can indeed
be rewritten in a manifestly Lorentz--invariant way, and the PST--symmetries
ensure correspondingly that $c$ is non propagating.


\subsection{The potential $B_6$ and its curvature $H_7$}

The first step in writing a duality--invariant action consists
in the introduction of a dual potential, i.e. in the solution
of the $B_3$--equation of motion (\ref{2}) in terms of a potential. Once this
is done in a consistent way, the construction of the duality--invariant
action a la PST is almost canonical.

A consistent reconstruction of a potential $B_6$ relies on the fact
that the r.h.s. of (\ref{2}) is a well defined {\it invariant closed} form,
so it can be written as the differential of some seven--form. To make this
seven--form explicit we must introduce a new target--space form $O_7$ whose
existence is guaranteed by
 $$
d(kJ_5+J_8)=-j_4J_5+J_9=0\rightarrow kJ_5+J_8=dO_7.
 $$
This allows to recast the Bianchi identity (\ref{1}) for $B_3$ and its
equation of motion (\ref{2}), in the equivalent system of equations
 \bea
H_4&=&dB_3+gK,\label{H4}\\
H_7&=&dB_6+{1\over 2}B_3\,dB_3+g(d\widehat b +B_3)K+
g^2\left(I_7^0+{1\over 8}(P_7^0+Y_7)\right)+e\,O_7,\label{H7}\\
  H_4&=&*H_7.
 \eea
The dual potential is defined a priori up to a field redefinition;
the choice (\ref{H7}) corresponds to a choice for $B_6$ which is {\it regular
on $M_6$}, as we will see now. The necessity of a regular $B_6$ results from
the fact that the duality--invariant action will contain the minimal coupling
$\int B_6J_5=\int_{M_6}B_6$.

In the formula for $H_7$ we introduced a field $\widehat b$ which represents
an unphysical (holographic) target--space extension of the two--form 
potential $b$ on $M_6$,
 $$
  \widehat b|_{M_6}=b,
 $$
so let us first establish that the extension is unobservable. Changing the
extension we have
 $$
 \widehat b^\prime =\widehat b + \Delta\widehat b,
\quad \Delta\widehat b|_{M_6}=0,
 $$
which leads in $H_7$ to a change $gd(\Delta\widehat b) K
=gd(\Delta \widehat b K)$.
$H_7$ is kept invariant if $B_6$ changes accordingly by
 \beq
 \label{suppl}
 B_6^\prime-B_6 =-g\Delta\widehat b\,K.
 \eeq
Notice that this transformation keeps $B_6|_{M_6}$ invariant
\footnote{There exists an alternative definition of a six--form potential
which avoids the extension of $b$: you can choose the singular potential
$\widetilde B_6= B_6+g\widehat b K$. This gives
 $$
H_7=d\widetilde B_6+{1\over 2}B_3dB_3-gbJ_5+gB_3K+
g^2\left(I_7^0+{1\over 8}(P_7^0+Y_7)\right)+eO_7,
 $$
and no unphysical extension of $b$ shows up. But with this potential
the formula for $H_7$ shows up a $\delta$--like singularity
on $M_6$ (the term $bJ_5$),
which is canceled by the singularity contained in $\widetilde B_6$.
Use of the potential $B_6$ and of an extended $\widehat b$ makes this
cancellation explicit.}.

The field--strength $H_7$ contains necessarily singularities
near $M_6$ and, as in the case of the four--form field--strength $H_4$, these
singularities have to be universal \footnote{The pullback of $H_7$ to
$M_6$ vanishes for dimensional reasons, so the singularities we are speaking
about are considered in the algebraic sense.}.
To make them explicit we should know the singular behaviour of $O_7$ near
the $M5$--brane. From
its defining relation -- which determines it modulo a closed form -- it is
clear that there exists a choice, such that its singular part near $M_6$ is
$kK$. Since $B_6$, $B_3$, $I_7^0$ and $P_7^0$ are regular near $M_6$,
the universal singular behaviours of the curvatures are given by
 \bea
\left[H_4\right]_{sing} &=& gK, \nonumber\\
\left[H_7\right]_{sing} &=& g\,hK+{g^2\over 8}\,Y_7.\nonumber
 \eea

The consistency of this construction requires now that under
$Q$--transformations of $B_3$, $H_7$ is invariant in compatibility with a
{\it regular transformation law} for $B_6$ on $M_6$ \footnote{Since the
r.h.s. of
(\ref{2}) is $Q$--invariant, it is obvious that there exists always a
transformation $\Delta B_6$ which keeps $H_7$ invariant; it is less trivial
that $\Delta B_6$ is finite on $M_6$.}. Due to the presence of the
$SO(5)$--Chern--Simons form $P_7^0$ in $H_7$, one expects that under
$Q$--transformations one has the remnant anomalous $SO(5)$--transformation
 \beq\label{b6trans1}
 \Delta B_6|_{M_6}=-{g^2\over 8}P^1_6|_{M_6}.
 \eeq

Since $O_7$ is $Q$--invariant, to deduce the transformation of $B_6$
one must first determine the transformation law of
 $$
S\equiv P_7^0+Y_7.
 $$
Under $K^\prime =K+dQ$, since $KK={1\over 4}\,dS$, one obtains easily
 \beq
 \label{Strans}
S^\prime=S+8KQ+4Q\,dQ+d\,{\cal P},
 \eeq
for some six--form ${\cal P}$. But we have also
$S^\prime=P_7^{0\prime}+Y_7^\prime$, and since $Y_7^\prime$ and
$Y_7$ have the same (singular) behaviour near $M_6$ we get
$(Y_7^\prime -Y_7)|_{M_6}=0$, and therefore
 $$
 (S^\prime-S)|_{M_6}=(P_7^{0\prime}-P_7^0)|_{M_6}=dP_6^1|_{M_6}.
 $$
Comparing this with (\ref{Strans}) and remembering that $Q|_{M_6}=0$ we get, 
apart from a closed form,
 \beq
 \label{qpull}
{\cal P}|_{M_6}=P_6^1|_{M_6}.
 \eeq
Using (\ref{Strans}) it is  eventually straightforward to show that $H_7$ is
$Q$--invariant under
 \bea
   K^\prime&=&K+dQ,\\
   B_3^\prime&=&B_3-gQ,\\
   B_6^\prime&=&B_6-g\left(d\widehat b+{1\over 2}B_3\right)Q
       -{g^2\over 8}\,{\cal P},
 \eea
which proves also that $B_6$ has a regular transformation law on
$M_6$, given by (\ref{b6trans1}). Under $SO(1,10)$--transformations
one must obviously also have
 \beq\label{b6trans2}
\delta B_6=-g^2 I_6^1.
 \eeq
$H_7$ is also invariant under ordinary gauge transformations,
 \beq
\label{ordinary} \delta B_3=d\Lambda_2,\quad \delta
B_6=d\Lambda_5-{1\over 2}\,\Lambda_2\,dB_3,\quad \delta\widehat
b=d\Lambda_1-\Lambda_2.
 \eeq

\subsection{Duality--invariant action and PST--symmetries}

Once we have introduced a dual potential the construction of a
duality--invariant action, according to the PST--approach, requires the
introduction of an auxiliary target--space scalar field $C(x)$. Due to
the presence of a chiral field on the $M5$--brane, whose action required
already an auxiliary field $c(\sigma)$ on $M_6$, as shown in \cite{bbs}
the consistency of the whole construction demands now that $c$ is the
pullback of $C$,
 $$
 c=C|_{M_6}.
 $$
Apart from this, the construction proceeds as follows. Define the
target--space vector
 $$
V_\mu={\pa_\mu C\over \sqrt{\pa C\,\pa C}},\quad V^\mu V_\mu=1,
 $$
and the target--space three-- and six--forms
 $$
f_3\equiv i_V(H_4-*H_7),\quad f_6\equiv i_V(H_7-*H_4),
 $$
which realize the decomposition
 \beq\label{decomp}
   H_4-*H_7=-(Vf_3+*Vf_6), \quad V=dC/\sqrt{\pa C\,\pa C}.
 \eeq
Then the duality--invariant action is given in terms of (\ref{action}) by
 \beq\label{duinv}
S[B_3,B_6,\widehat b,C]=S_0[B_3,b,c]
+{1\over 2}\int_{M_{11}}f_3*f_3.
 \eeq
In this new framework $H_4$ and $H_7$ are defined in terms of $B_3$ and $B_6$
as in (\ref{H4}) and (\ref{H7}), and the duality relation $H_4=*H_7$ is
promoted to an equation of motion which should be produced by $S$ together
with the $b$--equation (\ref{precise}) 
\footnote {Despite the explicit appearance of $\widehat b$ in $H_7$ the
action $S$ is actually only a functional of $b$, as explained in the previous
subsection.}.

We show now that $S$ entails the same dynamics as $S_0$, i.e. that the two
actions are physically equivalent. The starting point are
the equations of motion for $B_3$, $B_6$, $b$ and $C$; the complete set,
and their derivation, is given in appendix C. For our purposes it is
sufficient to know the equations for $B_6$ and $B_3$, which read
 \bea
 d(Vf_3)&=&0, \label{b6}\\
d(Vf_6)&=&gv({\cal H}-{\cal W})J_5 -Vf_3H_4,\label{b3}
 \eea
where ${\cal H}$ and ${\cal W}$ are defined in subsection 6.1.
Knowledge of these equations is sufficient because the $b$--equation is
implied by the $B_3$--equation (as
a direct consequence of the gauge invariance $\delta B_3=d\Lambda_2$,
$\delta b=-\Lambda_2|_{M_6}$), and the
the $C$--equation is identically satisfied if the other three equations of
motion hold. This is a consequence of the fact that $C$ is a non--propagating
auxiliary field. The action $S$ is in fact invariant 
(see appendix C for the proof) under the
PST--transformations $(I)$ 
 \beq\label{uno}
\delta \widehat b=dC\Psi_1,\quad\delta B_3=dC \Psi_2,
\quad \delta B_6=dC\Psi_5,\quad\delta C=0,
 \eeq
with transformation parameters $\Psi_1$, $\Psi_2$ and $\Psi_5$,
and under $(II)$
 \bea
\delta C&=&\Phi,\\
\delta \widehat b&=&
\Phi\left[{1\over \sqrt{\pa c\pa c}}\,({\cal H}-{\cal W})\right],\\
\delta B_3&=&{\Phi\over\sqrt{\pa C\pa C}}\,f_3,\\
\delta B_6&=&{\Phi\over\sqrt{\pa C\pa C}}\,f_6-{1\over
2}B_3\,\delta B_3 -g\,\delta \widehat b\,K,\label{due}
 \eea
where $\Phi$ is a scalar transformation parameter; with
$\left[{1\over \sqrt{\pa c\pa c}}({\cal H}-{\cal W})\right]$ we indicate an
arbitrary target--space extension of the two--form between brackets.

$\Phi$ being arbitrary, the symmetry $(II)$ ensures that the auxiliary field
$C$ is non propagating, and the symmetries $(I)$
allow to reduce the equations of motion (\ref{b6}) and (\ref{b3}) to
 $$
H_4=*H_7,\quad  {\cal H}-{\cal W}=0,
 $$
which proves that $S$ and $S_0$ are equivalent. To see how this happens
consider the most general solution of (\ref{b6}),
 $$
 Vf_3=dCd\widetilde \Psi_2,
 $$
for some two--form $\widetilde \Psi_2$. Since under a transformation
$(I)$ of $B_3$ we have $Vf_3\rightarrow Vf_3-dCd\Psi_2$, we can use this
symmetry (with $\Psi_2=\widetilde\Psi_2$) to set $Vf_3=0$. This is the same
as
 $$
f_3=0,
 $$
because $i_Vf_3=0$ identically. At this point, taking the differential
of (\ref{b3}) one gets \footnote{The $b$--equation of motion is precisely
obtained by taking the differential of the $B_3$--equation, see appendix C.}
 $$
d(v({\cal H}-{\cal W}))=0,
 $$
and one can use the same procedure as above --
using the symmetry $(I)$ of $\widehat b$ -- to reduce this equation to
 $$
{\cal H}-{\cal W}=0.
 $$
This simplifies eventually the $B_3$--equation to $d(Vf_6)=0$,
and the symmetry $(I)$ of $B_6$ can be used to reduce it further to $f_6=0$.
The identity (\ref{decomp}) completes then the proof.

\subsection{Comparison with the $M5$--brane $\sigma$--model}

The action presented in the present paper describes a fully interacting theory
of dynamical supergravity with dynamical brane--like sources, as is appropriate
to discuss, for example, anomaly cancellation. On the contrary
the $M5$--brane $\sigma$--model action \cite{prl,schwarz}
constrains the supergravity fields to satisfy the (source--less)
equations of motion of pure $D=11$ Sugra, as required by
$\kappa$--symmetry. In the comparison this fundamental difference has to be
taken into account.

The bosonic part of the $\sigma$--model action reads
 $$
   S^\sigma =-g\int_{M_6}d^6\sigma\sqrt{-g}\,{\cal L}(h)+
 g\int_{M_6}\left(B_6-{1\over2}\,b\,dB_3\right),
  $$
where $h=db+B_3|_{M_6}$, since we disregard here the $M2$--brane
($e=0$). The structure of the Wess--Zumino term (the second integral) 
is fixed by invariance
under the ordinary gauge transformations (\ref{ordinary}). Since
the $\sigma$--model action contains as main building block the standard 
minimal coupling term $\int_{M_6} B_6=\int_{M_{11}}J_5B_6$, to make the
comparison we should view our action $S$ from the
$B_6$--point--of--view. This can be done using the identity
 $$
 -{1\over 2}\left(H_4*H_4-f_3*f_3\right)=
{1\over 2}\left(H_7*H_7+f_6*f_6\right)-H_4H_7,
 $$
which is once more a consequence of (\ref{decomp}). This allows to rewrite $S$
as
 \bea
S&=&\widehat S_{kin}+\widehat S_{wz},\nonumber\\
\widehat S_{kin}&=&{1\over
2}\int_{M_{11}}\left(H_7*H_7+f_6*f_6\right)
-g\int_{M_6}d^6\sigma\sqrt{-g}\,{\cal L}(h),\nonumber\\
\widehat
S_{wz}&=&\int_{M_{11}}\left(L_{11}-H_4H_7\right)\nonumber.
 \eea
This form of the action privileges indeed the role of the
potential $B_6$: it appears only through the canonical kinetic
term ${1\over 2}H_7*H_7$ (apart from the square of the six--form
$f_6$ which vanishes on--shell), and through the standard minimal
coupling to the $M5$--brane contained in $H_4H_7$. The kinetic
term for the $M5$--brane in $\widehat S_{kin}$ is already the same
as in $S^\sigma$, and the Wess--Zumino action $\widehat S_{wz}$ can 
be split in the three contributions,
 \bea
\widehat S_{wz}&=&S_{wz}^{sugra}+S_{wz}^\sigma+S_{wz}^{int},\nonumber\\
         S_{wz}^{sugra}&=&-{1\over 3}\int_{M_{11}}B_3dB_3dB_3,\nonumber\\
         S_{wz}^\sigma&=&g\int_{M_6}\left(B_6-{1\over2}\,b\,dB_3\right),
\nonumber\\
         S_{wz}^{int}&=&-g\int_{M_{11}}\left(B_3dB_3K+gB_3KK
             +{g^2\over
             12}\,(P_7^0+Y_7)K\right)+g\int_{M_6}b\,dB_3,\nonumber
 \eea
where all three contributions are separately invariant under the
ordinary gauge transformations (\ref{ordinary}). $S_{wz}^{sugra}$
represents the pure supergravity contribution: the coefficient
$-1/3$ instead of $+1/6$ of the standard $B_3$--based Sugra is due
to the fact that this scheme privileges $B_6$. $S_{wz}^\sigma$ is
indeed the $\sigma$--model Wess--Zumino action showing up in
$S^\sigma$.  Very naively one could have expected that the total
Wess--Zumino action is simply $S_{wz}^{sugra}+S_{wz}^\sigma$, but
the fact is that  while $S_{wz}^\sigma$ is $Q$--invariant (modulo
gravitational anomalies) $S_{wz}^{sugra}$ is not. The additional
interaction terms of $S_{wz}^{int}$  (of order $g$, $g^2$, and
$g^3$) cure this non--invariance. By direct inspection one sees
indeed that
 $$
S_{wz}^{sugra}+S_{wz}^{int}=-2\int_{M_{11}}
\left(L_{11}-g^2H_4\,I_7^0\right),
 $$
which is manifestly $Q$--invariant (modulo gravitational
anomalies). Eventually, it is only the total action, Wess--Zumino
+ kinetic terms, that is invariant under PST--symmetries.

Finally it is instructive to  analyze how the duality--invariant
action realizes the cancellation of the gravitational $M5$--brane
anomalies. $S_{wz}^{sugra}$ is invariant and $S_{wz}^\sigma$
carries the anomaly (see (\ref{b6trans1}) and (\ref{b6trans2})),
 $$
 -\left(I_8+{1\over 8}\,P_8\right),
 $$
but this would not be the right amount to cancel the quantum
anomaly $I_8+{1\over 24}\,P_8$. But also $S_{wz}^{int}$ carries an
anomaly, ${1\over 12}\,P_8$, and it ensures hence the
matching; gravitational anomalies and $Q$--invariance are once
more entangled.

Our duality invariant--action $S$ can be compared also with the 
duality--invariant action $S_{BBS}$ of \cite{bbs}, formula (5.28), 
that is based on 
a Dirac--brane approach. In that action the (ill--defined) products of
$\delta$--functions 
on  Dirac--branes -- like $C_gC_g$ -- are ignored. This implies that $S_{BBS}$ 
contains at most terms linear in $g$ and that it carries no gravitational 
anomalies. Correspondingly one can see that our action (\ref{duinv}) 
(for $e=0$) reduces to $S_{BBS}$ -- after correcting a factor 1/2 -- if 
one neglects all terms of order $g^2$ 
and $g^3$, and replaces the Chern--kernel $K$ with the $\delta$--function
on the Dirac--brane $C_g$.

\section{Concluding remarks and open problems}

There are attempts in the literature to construct low energy effective
actions for $M5$--branes (with or without $M2$--branes) 
relying on potentials $B_3$ which are 
ill--defined on the $M5$--brane worldvolume \cite{bbs,alwis,jussi,xavier};
they are based on Dirac--branes, or something equivalent to them, and 
a consistent treatment of the resulting singularities is still missing 
\footnote{Since in the $M5$--brane effective action the interaction is cubic 
and since products of $\delta$--functions do not define distributions 
the authors think that for this case a consistent
treatment can not be achieved.}. 
These approaches refrain, in particular, from specifying the singular 
behaviour of the field strength $H_4$ near the $M5$--brane and they entail 
correspondingly two main drawbacks:
the dynamics i.e. the action -- but even the equations of motion -- contain 
ill--defined objects, such as the pullback of $B_3$ or -- even worse -- 
of $H_4$ and, moreover, the
(formal) actions which result from these approaches do not cancel the
gravitational anomalies. The Chern--kernel approach solves these
two problems simultaneously.   

In this paper we considered a topologically trivial space--time. 
Nevertheless the Wess--Zumino action
$$ 
S_{wz}=\int_{M_{12}}L_{12},
$$
with $L_{12}$ given in (\ref{l12}), should make sense also in a target--space
$M_{11}$ with non--trivial topological properties. In such a space--time the 
crucial feature is the dependence of $S_{wz}$ on the chosen twelve--manifold
$M_{12}$ with boundary $M_{11}$. In the absence of {\it global} quantum 
anomalies one would require that ${1\over G}S_{wz}$ is independent of the 
chosen 
$M_{12}$ modulo $2\pi$. This would be equivalent to require that
$$
{1\over G}\int_M L_{12}=2\pi n,
$$ 
with $n$ integer, for a generic closed manifold $M$. However, as shown
in \cite{flux1,flux2}, even  in the absence of $M2$-- and $M5$--branes the 
above integral is in general only an integer multiple of $\pi$, meaning that
$exp\left({i\over G}S_{wz}\right)$ carries a residual sign--dependence on 
$M_{12}$. But in \cite{flux1} it is 
then also shown that the quantum effective action carries a global anomaly,
due to the fermionic determinant of the Rarita--Schwinger operator, 
which compensates precisely this sign--ambiguity. 

A similar situation is supposed to arise in the presence of $M2$--
and $M5$--branes. In this case there are additional global quantum
anomalies \cite{Witten,flux2} due to the branes, but one expects again that
the total effective action is well--defined. This conjecture needs still
to be proved, but since the formula (\ref{l12}) is explicit and involves 
only objects with a simple and clear geometrical meaning, we hope to be able
to provide a proof based on that formula.

In the absence of branes the proof of cancellation of global anomalies 
of reference \cite{flux1} relied on the statement that $H$ 
defines a half--integral cohomology class, i.e. $[H]\in {g\over 2}\,{\bf Z}$.
In presence of an $M5$--brane a necessary condition for global anomaly 
cancellation is then that $H$ represents a half--integral
class {\it in the complement of $M5$}. We can check here that 
this minimal condition can be easily satisfied in our construction.
The first step concerns the definition of $H$ in terms of the
Chern--kernel $K$. In a topologically non--trivial space--time the 
form $K$ must have the following defining properties: 1) near $M5$ it 
behaves as in (\ref{even}) and 2) in the complement of $M5$ it amounts
to a closed form. An explicit realization like (\ref{even}) is 
still available  
if there exists a map $y^a(x)$ from  target--space to ${\bf R}^5$, reducing to
normal coordinates in a tubular neighborhood of $M5$ and nowhere vanishing
in its complement. Defining 
$\yh^a=y^a/|y|$ we can then introduce a globally defined four--form $K$ 
according to (\ref{even}) and write
 \beq\label{coho}
H=H_0+gK,
 \eeq
where $H_0$ (locally $dB_3$) is a half--integral cohomology class,  
$[H_0]\in {g\over 2}\,{\bf Z}$, as assumed in \cite{flux1} in absence of
branes. Using the above
realization for $K$ we can now show that also
$$ 
[K]\in {\bf Z}/2\quad {\rm in\,\, the\,\, complement\,\, of}\,\, M5.
$$
Take in each point of target--space an $SO(4)$--basis $n^{ar}(x)$ 
normal to $\yh^a$, $n^{ar}\yh^a=0$, $n^{ar}n^{as}=\delta^{rs}$, 
$r,s=(1,\cdots,4)$.
Construct then the $SO(4)$--connection and curvature 
$W^{rs}\equiv n^{sa}Dn^{ra}$, 
$T=dW+WW$. Since one has 
$T^{rs}=n^{ra}n^{sb}\left(F^{ab}+D\yh^aD\yh^b\right)$
and $\ve^{a_1\cdots a_5}\yh^{a_5}=\ve^{r_1\cdots r_4}n^{r_1a_1}\cdots
n^{r_4a_4}$, it is immediately seen that
$$
K={1\over 2}\,\chi(T),
$$
i.e. one--half of the $SO(4)$--Euler--form of the curvature $T$
\footnote{The frames $n^{ar}$ can not be glued together continuously all over 
the target--space. Even in a space--time with trivial topology they carry 
necessarily a singularity along a seven--manifold $M_7$ whose boundary
 is $M5$. This 
implies that $T$ is singular along $M_7$ while $\chi(T)$, being 
$SO(4)$--invariant i.e. independent of $n^{ar}$, is singular only
on $M5$. This means that we have $d\chi(T)=0$ in the complement of $M5$,
while in the whole target--space we have $d\chi(T)=2J_5$.}.
This implies that $K$ has in general semi--integer integrals over closed 
four--manifolds which do not intersect $M5$. However, its integral over a 
four--sphere linking $M5$ equals unity, since the Euler--characteristics of a 
four--sphere is two: this reflects clearly the fact that the $M5$--brane
carries one unit of magnetic charge.

\section{Regularizations}

Instead of giving general formulae for the ``real algebraic approximation
mode'' \cite{charact}, we present here examples one for an even
and one for an odd current, generalizations being straightforward.

First we approximate our $\delta$--like currents $J$ with smooth ones
$J^\ve$ that preserve $SO(n)$--invariance and depend algebraically
on $F^{ab}$, $y^a$ and $Dy^a$; for $n=5$ and $n=4$  we have
 \bea
J_5^\ve&=&{1\over 4(2\pi)^3}\,{\ve\over \ve^2+y^2}\,\ve^{a_1\cdots a_5}
           Dy^{a_1}\left(F^{a_2a_3}F^{a_4a_5}+
          {4\over 3 (\ve^2+y^2)}\,F^{a_2a_3}Dy^{a_4}Dy^{a_5}\right.
\nonumber\\
&&\phantom{{1\over 4(2\pi)^3}{\ve\over \ve^2+y^2}\,\ve^{a_1\cdots a_5}
           Dy^{a_1}}
\left.+{8\over 15(\ve^2+y^2)^2}\,Dy^{a_2}Dy^{a_3}Dy^{a_4}Dy^{a_5}
          \right),
\label{j5reg}\\
J_4^\ve&=&{1\over8(2\pi)^2}{\ve\over
           \sqrt{\ve^2+y^2}}\,\ve^{a_1\cdots a_4}\left(F^{a_1a_2}F^{a_3a_4}+
           {2\over\ve^2+y^2}\,F^{a_1a_2}
           Dy^{a_3}Dy^{a_4}\right.\nonumber\\
           &&\phantom{{1\over8(2\pi)^2}{\ve\over \sqrt{\ve^2+y^2}}\,
           \ve^{a_1\cdots a_4}}
\left.+{1\over (\ve^2+y^2)^2}\, Dy^{a_1}Dy^{a_2}Dy^{a_3}Dy^{a_4}\right).
\label{j4reg}
 \eea
These currents satisfy
 \bea\nonumber
\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}J^\ve&=& J\\
dJ^\ve&=&0\nonumber\\
\int_{M_n}J^\ve&=&1,\nonumber
 \eea
where the last integral is along an $n$--dimensional manifold at
$\sigma^i=\sigma_0^i$. The currents $J^\ve$ enjoy therefore the following
properties: they are closed and
invariant, they entail the same total charge as $J$ and they are regular at
$M$: we have indeed the pullback formulae
 \bea\label{a1}
J^\ve_4|_M&=&\chi_4(f)\\
J^\ve_5|_M&=&0,\label{a2}
 \eea
where $\chi(f)$ for a generic even $n$ is the $SO(n)$--Euler--form
on $M$. These formulae represent, in particular, an explicit realization of
the Thom--isomorphism \cite{BT}. Regularized Chern--kernels satisfy by
definition
$$
J^\ve=dK^\ve, \quad \lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}K^\ve=K,
$$
and it is not difficult to find explicit expressions. For the even kernel
one gets
 \beq\label{k4reg}
K_4^\ve={1\over 4(2\pi)^3}\,\ve^{a_1\cdots a_5}
           \yh^{a_1}\left(f_1F^{a_2a_3}F^{a_4a_5}+
         f_2F^{a_2a_3}D\yh^{a_4}D\yh^{a_5}
            +f_3D\yh^{a_2}D\yh^{a_3}D\yh^{a_4}D\yh^{a_5}\right),
 \eeq
with
 \bea\nonumber
f_1&=&\arctan{y\over\ve}\\
f_2&=&2\left(\arctan{y\over\ve}-{\ve y\over\ve^2+y^2}\right)\nonumber\\
f_3&=& \arctan{y\over\ve}-{\ve y\over\ve^2+y^2}
          -{2\over 3}{\ve y^3\over (\ve^2+y^2)^2},
\eea
and it is straightforward to see that for $\ve\rightarrow 0$ one obtains
(\ref{even}) for $n=5$. For the odd kernel we get instead
 \beq
K_3^\ve=\Omega_3^\ve+\chi_3^0(A),
 \eeq
where
 \beq
\Omega_3^\ve={1\over 2(4\pi)^2}\,\ve^{a_1\dots
a_4}\yh^{a_1}D\yh^{a_2}\left( g_1 F^{a_3a_4}+
g_2D\yh^{a_3}D\yh^{a_4}\right),
 \eeq
with
 \bea
g_1&=&4\left({\ve\over\sqrt{y^2+\ve^2}}-1\right)\\
g_2&=&{8\over 3}\left({\ve^3+{3\over 2}\ve y^2\over(y^2+\ve^2)^{3/2}}
-1\right).
 \eea
For $\ve\rightarrow 0$ $\Omega_3^\ve$ reduces to (\ref{omega}).
The regularized even kernel is invariant, as $K_4$, and the odd one maintains
the transformation property of $K_3$ since $\Omega_3^\ve$ is invariant. Both
kernels are regular on $M$ and one gets
 \bea
K_3^\ve|_M&=&\chi^0_3(a)\\
K_4^\ve|_M&=&0,\label{k4epull}
 \eea
obviously in agreement with (\ref{a1}), (\ref{a2}).

To illustrate the use of these formulae we provide a simple alternative proof
of (\ref{serve}). Considering the limits in the sense of distributions
we can write
$$
d(YK)=\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}d\left(YK^\ve\right)=\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}
\left(dYK^\ve+YJ^\ve\right),
$$
where we are allowed to use Leibnitz's rule since $K^\ve$ is a regular
distribution. The
first term converges trivially to $dYK$, while the second term is in the limit
necessarily supported on $M$ (as $\ve \rightarrow 0$ only terms with
$y=0$ contribute, see (\ref{j5reg})).
This means that
$$
\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}YJ^\ve= {\cal Y}J,
$$
for some form ${\cal Y}$ which is defined on $M$ \footnote{Notice that the
existence of the limit $\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}YK^\ve=YK$ in the
distributional sense ensures the existence of the limit
$\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}d(YK^\ve)$ in the distributional sense; the same
property does in general not hold in linear spaces of functions, endowed with
stronger topology.}. Moreover, since $Y$ as well as $J^\ve$ are
$SO(n)$--invariant forms, also ${\cal Y}$ must be an invariant form on $M$;
but since ${\cal Y}$ is an odd form it must necessarily vanish, because
there are no invariant odd forms on $M$, made out of the $SO(n)$--connection
$a^{ab}$.

Similarly one can show that for even kernels the product $KK$ is a closed form,
$$
d(KK)=\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}d\left(KK^\ve\right)=\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}
\left(JK^\ve+KJ^\ve\right)=\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}KJ^\ve,
$$
where the last equality follows from (\ref{k4epull}). As above one has
$\lim_{\ve\rightarrow 0}KJ^\ve={\cal K}J$, for some invariant even form
${\cal K}$ which must be also {\it odd under parity of the normal bundle}
i.e. proportional to $\ve^{a_1\cdots a_n}$, as is $K$. But since $n$ is odd
no such form exists, and hence ${\cal K}=0$.

\section{Existence and construction of the three--form $X$}

We begin giving the explicit expression of the $SO(5)$--kernel
 \beq
\label{k4}
K={1\over 4(4\pi)^2}\,\ve^{a_1\cdots a_5}\,\hat
y^{a_1}\left(F^{a_2a_3}+D\yh^{a_2}D\yh^{a_3}\right)
\left(F^{a_4a_5}+D\yh^{a_4}D\yh^{a_5}\right),
 \eeq
and recalling the definition of the Euler--form, the
associated Chern--Simons form  and its descent, for a generic $SO(4)$--bundle
with connection $W$ and curvature $T=dW+WW$,
 \bea
\chi(T) &=&{1\over 2(4\pi)^2}\,\ve^{r_1\cdots r_4}
T^{r_1r_2}T^{r_3r_4},\nonumber\\
\chi^0(W)&=&{1\over 2(4\pi )^2}\,\ve^{r_1\dots r_4}\left(
W^{r_1r_2}dW^{r_3r_4}+ {2\over 3}\,W^{r_1r_2}\left(
WW\right)^{r_3r_4} \right),\nonumber\\
\chi^1(W)&=& {1\over 2(4\pi )^2}\,\ve^{r_1\dots r_4}
L^{r_1r_2}dW^{r_3r_4},\nonumber\\
 \chi(T)&=&d\,\chi^0(W), \quad \delta \chi^0(W)=d\,\chi^1(W),
  \quad \delta W^{rs}=DL^{rs}.
\nonumber
 \eea
We are searching for a form $X$ on $M_3$ such that
 \beq\label{sempre}
KJ_8+{1\over 2}\,\chi_b^0J_9=d(XJ_8),
 \eeq
where $\chi_b^0(w)$ is the Chern--Simons form of the Euler--form,
with $SO_b(4)$--connection $w^{rs}$ on $M_2$. Since
$KJ_8=K|_{M_3}J_8$, what appears really in this formula is the
pullback of $K$ on $M_3$, and we will now show that the pullback
form is a closed form, more precisely that
 $$
K|_{M_3}=dX,
 $$
where $X$ is the form we are searching for. In $K|_{M_3}$ all
objects of (\ref{k4}) are evaluated on $M_3$. If we parametrize
$M_3$ by $x^\mu(\sigma)$ we get in particular $u^a(\sigma)\equiv
\yh^a(x(\sigma))$, which determines in each point of $M_3$ a
particular direction. This allows to define on $M_3$ the reduction
-- along $u^a$ -- of the $SO(5)$--connection $A^{ab}$ down to an
$SO(4)$--connection $W^{rs}(\sigma)$. The reduction procedure is
canonical: define on $M_3$ an $SO(4)$--basis $n^{ra}$ normal to
$u^a$, $r=(1,\cdots,4)$,
 $$
n^{ra}u^a=0,\quad n^{ra}n^{sa}=\delta^{rs},\quad u^au^a=1;
 $$
then the reduced connection and curvature are given by
 $$
W^{rs}=n^{sa}Dn^{ra}, \quad T^{rs}=dW^{rs}+W^{rt}W^{ts}.
 $$
With these definitions it is straightforward to show that one has
the identities
 $$
T^{rs}=n^{ra}n^{sb}\left(F^{ab}|_{M_3}+Du^aDu^b\right),\quad
 \ve^{a_1\cdots a_5}u^{a_5}=\ve^{r_1\cdots r_4}n^{r_1a_1}\cdots
  n^{r_4a_4}.
 $$
Using them in the restriction of (\ref{k4}) to $M_3$, one sees
immediately that this restriction amounts to the Euler--form of
$T$, apart from a factor 1/2,
 $$
 K|_{M_3}={1\over 2}\,\chi(T).
 $$
The three--form $X$ is then simply the Chern--Simons form of $W$,
 \beq
 X={1\over 2}\,\chi^0(W).
 \eeq
To prove that this $X$ satisfies indeed (\ref{sempre}) it remains
to show that the restriction of $W^{rs}$ from $M_3$ to $M_2$
coincides with the $SO_b(4)$--connection $w^{rs}$. This can be
seen as follows.  Since the $y^a$ are normal coordinates on $M_6$
and $u^a=\yh^a|_{M_3}$, we have that the vector $\widetilde
u^a\equiv u^a|_{M_2}$ coincides with the (normalized) component
normal to $M_6$, of the unique vector on $M_2$ which is tangent to
$M_3$ and normal to $M_2$. But by definition (see section 5.1)
$SO_b(4)$ is the subgroup of $SO(5)$ on $M_2$ which leaves
$\widetilde u^a$ invariant. This means, by construction, that
$W^{rs}|_{M_2}=w^{rs}$.

From the explicit construction of $X$ one can deduce its
transformation properties under $Q$--transformations and
$SO_b(4)$--transformations respectively, checking thus (\ref{XQ}) and
(\ref{anoml11}):
 \bea
 \Delta X&=& Q|_{M_3}+d\phi,\nonumber\\
 \delta X&=& {1\over 2}\,d\,\chi^1(W),
\nonumber
 \eea
where $\phi$ is some two--form on $M_3$ with  $\phi|_{M_2}=0$,
and clearly  $\chi^1(W)|_{M_2}=\chi^1_b$.


\section{PST--invariance}

The main work one has to accomplish is to compute the variation of
$S$ under generic variations of the fields $B_3$, $B_6$, $\widehat
b$ and $C$. The result can be cast in the form
 \bea\nonumber
\delta S &=&\int_{M_{11}}\Bigg[\Bigg(d(Vf_6)+Vf_3H_4
 -gv({\cal H}-{\cal W})J_5\Bigg)\left(\delta B_3+d\delta \widehat b\right)\\
 &&-d(Vf_3)
 \left(\delta B_6+{1\over 2}\,B_3\delta B_3+g K\delta\widehat
 b\right)\nonumber\\
&&+dCd\left({g\over 2\pa c \pa c}\,
 ({\cal H}-{\cal W})({\cal H}-{\cal W})J_5
 -{1\over\pa C\pa C}f_3f_6\right)\delta C\Bigg].\nonumber
 \eea
To arrive at this formula one has to use (\ref{decomp}) and some
standard relations like $i_V*=*V$ and $*\,i_V=V*$; but, most
importantly, one has to use the identity for four--forms
 $$
 {\cal H}{\cal H}={\cal W}{\cal W},
 $$
which holds  because ${\cal W}$ is the functional derivative of
the Born--Infeld lagrangian. It is indeed the qualifying property
for all allowed lagrangians, i.e. those which give rise to a
consistent (Lorentz--invariant) dynamics for a (self--interacting)
chiral boson in six dimensions.

The equations of motion for $B_6$, $B_3$, $\widehat b$ and $C$ can
be read directly from $\delta S$ and are given respectively by,
 \bea
 d(Vf_3)&=&0\label{A}\\
d(Vf_6)&=&gv({\cal H}-{\cal W})J_5 -Vf_3H_4\label{C}\\
gd(v({\cal H}-{\cal W}))J_5&=&-d(Vf_3H_4)\label{B}\\
dCd\left({g\over 2\pa c \pa c}\,
 ({\cal H}-{\cal W})({\cal H}-{\cal W})J_5
 -{1\over\pa C\pa C}f_3f_6\right)&=&0\label{D}.
 \eea
One sees that the $\widehat b$--equation is supported on $M_6$,
because the r.h.s. of (\ref{B}) is proportional to $J_5$, thanks to
(\ref{A}). This is consistent with the fact that the extension
$\widehat b$ is a pure gauge degree of freedom. It is also
immediate to see that the $\widehat b $--equation is a consequence
of the $B_3$--equation, and that the $C$--equation is a
consequence of the other three equations.

Eventually, proving invariance of $S$ under the
PST--transformations (\ref{uno})--(\ref{due}) -- given the above
form of $\delta S$ -- is a simple exercise.
