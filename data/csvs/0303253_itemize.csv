\item The limit $Q \rightarrow 0$ leads to the single D8-brane solution which preserves 1/2 supersymmetry.
\item The limit $m \rightarrow 0$ leads to an (infinite)
F-string with D-particles smeared in the string direction, preserving 
1/4 supersymmetry. The F1- and D0-brane charges are related and therefore 
it is not possible to obtain these as single objects from the 
above solution.

\item
An object with negative tension, corresponding to an O8-plane which 
arises by dividing out by $\mathbb{Z}_2$.
The resulting harmonic function will be 
$H = c + m |y|$ with $c$ and $m$ positive \cite{Chamblin:1999ea, Bergshoeff:2001pv}. 
Indeed $H$ is positive for all values of $y$ and has a minimum at the 
O8-plane.
\item
An object with positive tension, corresponding to a D8-brane. 
Passing through such a domain wall leads to a decrease of the slope of the harmonic function 
\cite{Polchinski:1995df, Chamblin:1999ea, Bergshoeff:2001pv}. The prime example is
$H = c - m |y|$ with $c$ and $m$ positive. It follows that $H$ will vanish for some 
critical value of $y$.

\item 
The $q^r$ are the NS-NS and R-R charges of the $(p,q)$-particle, respectively.
\item
The matrix $M^s{}_r$ characterises the massive background and specifies which of the three gauged supergravities it corresponds to.
\item
The $V_s$ are the worldline vectors that correspond to the endpoints of the 
D-string and F-string on the $(p,q)$-particle worldline, respectively.

\item The $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ condition $qr - ps = 1$ should be
satisfied. This condition requires orthogonality of the strings and particle charges. It can be expressed as $q_1{}^r q_0{}_r = 1$.
\item The form of the mass matrix \eqref{mass} is given in 
(\ref{mass}). This mass matrix contains only two independent 
parameters $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ rather than three for an arbitrary but symmetric mass matrix. This restriction corresponds to $q_1{}^r M_{rs} q_0{}^s = 0$.

\item
In the $(p,q)$-particle brane action in a massive 9D background, see \eqref{particleaction}, 
a mass term similar to the coupling of the D-particle Born-Infeld vector to the background 
\eqref{term1} occurs.
\item
The supergravity solution \eqref{9Dsolution} consists of a smeared distribution of $(p,q)$-particles, 
from which $(r,s)$-strings are emanating and ending on the $(m_1,m_2,m_3)$-domain wall. There
are two orthogonality conditions on the seven parameters, as discussed in subsection 
\ref{9Dintersection}.
This is the natural generalisation of the 10D IIA solution \eqref{IIAsolution}.

\item
Two orientifold planes, one at each of the fixed points of the $S^1$, each carrying a charge of $(-16,-16)$ with respect to the two mass parameters $(\mu_1,\mu_2)$.
\item
Sixteen D7-branes and their images, located at arbitrary points between the two O7-planes and each carrying a charge of $(0,1)$.
\item
Sixteen Q7-branes and their images, defined as S-duals of the D7-branes, also distributed between the two O7-planes and each carrying a charge of $(1,0)$.
