We introduce a new map between a $q$-deformed gauge theory defined on a
general $GL_{q}\left( N\right) $-covariant quantum hyperplane and an
ordinary gauge theory \ in a full analogy with Seiberg-Witten map.
Perturbative analysis of the $q$-deformed QED at the classical level is
presented and gauge fixing \`{a} la BRST is discussed.
