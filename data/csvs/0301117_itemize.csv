\ben
r_+( t) = a(t) \int ^\infty _t { dt^\prime  \over a(t^\prime )} < \infty,
\een
there will be a {\it future event horizon}, that is a null hypersuface
separating events
which the observer at $r=0$ will see from those he or she  will
never see. In this case the future boundary at $t=\infty$ is spacelike
.The standard example of a cosmological spacetime with
a future horizon is de-Sitter spacetime. In this case the
(observer dependent) horizon
is also  Killing horizon  and its area $A_+(t)= 4 \pi a^2(t) r_ + (t)$
is constant with time. In general, if the weak energy condition
 holds,
$A_+(t)$ is non-decreasing. In the static  case
one  has an associated constant temperature $T_+= { 2 \pi \over H}$.
It is reasonable to assume that if $A_+(t)$
does not change too fast one simply replaces $ 1\over H$
in this expression by the instantaneous Hubble radius.
One usually ascribes a non-decreasing  entropy
\ben
S(t) = { 1\over 4 G} A_-(t),

to each co-moving  observer's horizon and interprets it
as  a measure of the total  information lost to he or she
up to time $t$.


\item If the scale factor vanishes at $t=0$, a  {\it Big-Bang }
singularity, and
\ben
r_ -(t) =a(t)  \int _0 ^t  { { dt^\prime}   \over { a(t^\prime )} } <
\infty ,
\een
then there will be a {\it  past  horizon }, that is a null hypersurface
separating events with which an
observer at $r=0$ can have been in causal contact since the Big Bang
from those he or she
cannot have been. In this case there is a singular spacelike past
boundary at $t=0$.  Events with time coordinate $t$ and radius $r< r_-(t) $
are said to be inside  the {\it particle horizon}. If identified with
the points on co-moving geodesics for which $r$ is independent of time,
the entire past  geodesic is outside the past light cone of the
observer at the origin. Indeed a light ray  starting from $t=0$
and $r=0$  just reaches  the particle horizon at any subsequent time.

\item The natural scale of the model is the Planck or String scale.
 Planck  scale inflation will in general give fluctuations which are
too large.
\item If the mass scale near the local maximum at the origin
 is too large,
 then insufficient inflation will result before the tachyon
field nears the minimum value of the potential.
\item The model requires fine tuning so as to avoid being becoming
matter dominated before there is time for a hot radiation
era  during which nucleosynthesis takes place. Alternatively,
if one wants the tachyon to act as
the cold dark matter apparently seen  at the present time,
again one seems to require an element of fine-tuning.

\item Because the tachyon does not oscillate in a potential well at
the end of rolling, the usual mechanism for reheating does not operate.

Propagation in directions orthogonal to $ {\bf E}$ is suppressed.
