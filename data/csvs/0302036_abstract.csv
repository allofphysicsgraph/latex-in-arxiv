We briefly discuss the twisting procedure applied to the
$\kappa$-defor\-med space-time. It appears that one can consider
only two kinds of such twistings: in space and time directions.
For both types of twisitngs we introduce related phase spaces and
consider briefly their properties. We discuss in detail the
changes of duality relations under the action of twist.
