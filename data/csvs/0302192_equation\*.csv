acts on the coordinates $x^M$ as
%
\begin{eqnarray}

\label{eq:susycomm}
\end{eqnarray}
%
Under this coordinate transformation, the metric $g_{MN}$ changes as
%
\begin{equation}
  g_{MN} \longrightarrow g_{MN} + \epsilon^L \partial_L g_{MN}
    + g_{LN} \partial_M \epsilon^L + g_{ML} \partial_N \epsilon^L.
\end{equation}
%

Now, a global supersymmetry transformation is defined as the 
supersymmetry transformation which leads to $\epsilon^M$ that leaves 
$g_{MN}$ unchanged. Namely, we require $\epsilon^M$ to satisfy
%
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon^L \partial_L g_{MN}
    + g_{LN} \partial_M \epsilon^L + g_{ML} \partial_N \epsilon^L = 0,
\end{equation}
%
or more explicitly
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  && \partial_5 \epsilon^5 = 0,
\label{eq:killingvector1} \\
  && g_{\mu\nu}\partial_5\epsilon^\nu 
     + \partial_\mu\epsilon^5 = 0,
\label{eq:killingvector2} \\
  && -2\sigma' g_{\mu\nu} \epsilon^5 
     + g_{\rho\nu}\partial_\mu\epsilon^\rho
     +g_{\mu\rho}\partial_\nu\epsilon^\rho = 0,
\label{eq:killingvector3}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\sigma' \equiv \partial\sigma/\partial y$.  The vector 
$\epsilon^M$ is called a Killing vector, and the above equations are 
called Killing vector equations.

By replacing $\epsilon^M$ in 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:killingvector1}~--~\ref{eq:killingvector3}) by 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:susycomm}), we find that the Killing vector equations 
are satisfied if $\xi$ (and $\eta$) satisfies certain conditions. 
Such a spinor is called a Killing spinor.  We write these conditions, 
called Killing spinor equations, using the symplectic Majorana 
spinor notation: we express the 5D supersymmetry transformation 
parameter $\xi$ by two Dirac spinors $\xi^1$ and $\xi^2$ obeying 
a single relation.\footnote{
Here, $\xi^1$ and $\xi^2$ {\it together} correspond to a {\it single} 
Dirac spinor $\xi$. They are related as
%
\begin{equation*}
  \xi^1 \equiv \xi, ~~~ \xi^2 \equiv -C\xi^*,
  \quad \mbox{so that} ~~ \xi^i = \epsilon^{ij}C\xi^*_j 
  ~~ \mbox{and} ~~ \xi^*_i = (\xi^i)^*,
\end{equation*}
%
where $C \equiv -\hat{\gamma^2}\gamma^5$ is the 5D charge conjugation 
matrix and has properties, $C^2=-1$ and $C \gamma^M C^{-1} 
= -\gamma^{M*}$. Thus both $\xi^1$ and $\xi^2$ properly transform 
as 5D Dirac spinors, and simultaneously they form a doublet under the 
$SU(2)_R$ automorphism group of the 5D supersymmetry. In terms of more 
familiar two component notation, they are:
%
\begin{equation*}
  \xi^1 = \left(
    \begin{array}{c} 
      \xi_{L\alpha} \\ \bar{\xi}_R^{\dot{\alpha}}
    \end{array} \right), 
~~~ 
  \xi^2 = \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
      -\xi_{R\alpha} \\ \bar{\xi}_L^{\dot{\alpha}}
    \end{array} \right).
\end{equation*}
%
There is one convenient identity for these spinors: 
$\bar{\xi}_i\gamma^M\cdots\gamma^K\eta^j = 
\bar{\eta}^j\gamma^K\cdots\gamma^M\xi_i$, for any 
$\xi^i$ and $\eta^i$.}
In this notation, Eq.~(\ref{eq:susycomm}) simply becomes 
$\epsilon^M=\bar{\eta}_i\gamma^M\xi^i$. First, we find 
that the most general form for the constraint that solves 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:killingvector1}) and is consistent with the 
4D Lorentz invariance is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \partial_5 \xi^i 
    = -\frac{\sigma'}{2} H^i_j \gamma_5\xi^j
      -\frac{i\sigma'}{2} K^i_j \xi^j,
\label{eq:killingspinoransatz1}
\end{equation}
%
where $\xi^i$ represents a general Killing spinor, and $H^i_j$ and 
$K^i_j$ are $2\times2$ arbitrary Hermitian matrices which can even 
depend on positions in spacetime. At this stage, the only constraints 
for these matrices come from differentiating the identity 
$\xi^i=\epsilon^{ij}C(\xi^j)^*$ by $y$, which leads to
%
\begin{equation}
  \mbox{Tr}[H] = \mbox{Tr}[K] = 0.
\end{equation}
%
We next consider Eq.~(\ref{eq:killingvector2}) and find that, in order 
to solve this, we need an equation for $\partial_\mu\xi^i$ as well as 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:killingspinoransatz1}).  The most general form of this is
given by
%
\begin{equation}
  \partial_\mu\xi^i 
    = -\frac{\sigma'}{2} H^i_j\gamma_\mu\xi^j
      -\frac{\sigma'}{2} \gamma_5\gamma_\mu\xi^i
      -\frac{i\sigma'}{2} L^i_j\gamma_\mu\xi^j,
\label{eq:killingspinoransatz2}
\end{equation}
%
where $L^i_j$ is a new arbitrary $2\times2$ Hermitian matrix. Finally, 
we consider the last equation, Eq.~(\ref{eq:killingvector3}). We find 
that this equation is satisfied if and only if
%
\begin{equation}
  L^i_j = 0.
\end{equation}
%
Therefore, we find that the Killing spinor must satisfy the equations
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \partial_5 \xi^i 
  &=& -\frac{\sigma'}{2} H^i_j \gamma_5\xi^j
      -\frac{i\sigma'}{2} K^i_j \xi^j,
\label{eq:naivekillingspinorequ1} \\
  \partial_\mu \xi^i 
  &=& -\frac{\sigma'}{2} H^i_j\gamma_\mu\xi^j
      -\frac{\sigma'}{2} \gamma_5 \gamma_\mu \xi^i,
\label{eq:naivekillingspinorequ2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $H^i_j$ and $K^i_j$ are arbitrary $2\times2$ traceless Hermitian 
matrices.

Let us now examine whether 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:naivekillingspinorequ1},~\ref{eq:naivekillingspinorequ2}) 
have a non-trivial solution or not.  If there exists a non-trivial 
and reasonable $\xi$, it must satisfy
%
\begin{equation}
  [\partial_M, \partial_N] \xi^i = 0.
\end{equation}
%
Evaluating the above commutator for $M=\mu$ and $N=\nu$ gives the 
following constraints on the matrix $H$:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  H^2 &=& {\bf 1},
\label{eq:const-1} \\
  \partial_\mu H &=& {\bf 0},
\label{eq:const-2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where ${\bf 1}$ and ${\bf 0}$ are the unit and zero $2 \times 2$ 
matrices.  On the other hand, $[\partial_\mu,\partial_5]\xi^i=0$ gives
the following constraints on $H$ and $K$:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \partial_\mu K &=& {\bf 0},
\label{eq:const-3} \\
  -i\partial_5 H &=& \left[ -\frac{\sigma'}{2}K, H \right],
\label{eq:const-4}
\end{eqnarray}
%
and the conditions for $\xi^i$:
%
\begin{equation}
  H^i_j(y) \xi^j = \gamma_5 \xi^i \qquad 
  \mbox{at } y=0 \mbox{ and } \pi R.
\label{eq:basicboundarycondition}
\end{equation}
%
Because the form of Eq.~(\ref{eq:const-4}) is identical to the 
Heisenberg equation of motion for the operator $H$ with ``time"" $y$ 
and ``Hamiltonian"" $-(\sigma'/2)K$, we can write the general 
solution as:
%
\begin{equation}
   H(y) = U(y) H(0) U^\dagger(y),
\end{equation}
%
where, having Eqs.~(\ref{eq:const-1},~\ref{eq:const-3}) in mind, $H(0)$ and 
$U(y)$ are given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  H(0) &=& n^a \sigma_a,
\\
  U(y) &=& \hat{\mbox{{\bf Y}}} 
    \exp\left[ -\frac{i}{2} \int^y_0 \sigma' K(y') dy' \right],
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $n^a$ ($a=1,2,3$) is a constant real vector with unit 
length $n^an^a=1$, $\sigma_a$ are the Pauli spin matrices, and 
$\hat{\mbox{{\bf Y}}}$ is the ``time""-ordering operator. We can 
check that this solution solves all the constraints on $H$ and 
$K$, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:const-1}~--~\ref{eq:const-4}).  Note also that
$U(y)$ belongs to $SU(2)$ because $K$ is Hermitian and traceless. 

The above Killing spinor equation contains important information 
about the symmetry structure of the theory.  We consider the 
$SU(2)_R$ automorphism group of the 5D supersymmetry, under which 
$\xi^1$ and $\xi^2$ form a doublet.  In flat space ($\sigma' = 0$), 
this $SU(2)_R$ is a symmetry of the algebra and thus respected 
by the whole theory.  In AdS, however, we find that it 
is broken by the presence of the matrices $H$ and $K$ in 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:naivekillingspinorequ1},~\ref{eq:naivekillingspinorequ2}). 
Now, we consider redefining the fields by a twist inside $SU(2)_R$. 
This results in the redefinition of $\xi^i$ according to
%
\begin{equation}
   \xi^i(y) \longrightarrow \tilde{U}(y)^i_j \xi^j(y),
\label{eq:redef}
\end{equation}
%
where $\tilde{U}(y)$ is a $y$-dependent matrix taking arbitrary 
values in $SU(2)$. Note that, since we are just redefining 
the name of the fields, this does not change any physics. 
Then, substituting Eq.~(\ref{eq:redef}) into 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:naivekillingspinorequ1},~\ref{eq:naivekillingspinorequ2}) 
and choosing $\tilde{U}(y) = U(y)$, we find that $H(y)$ is replaced 
by $H(0)$ and the $K(y)$ term is canceled.  We can further make 
a $y$-independent $SU(2)_R$ rotation and choose $(n^1,n^2,n^3) = (0,0,1)$ 
for $H(0)$. Therefore, we finally obtain the following simple form for 
the Killing spinor equations in AdS$_5$:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  \partial_5 \xi^i 
  &=& -\frac{\sigma'}{2} (\sigma_3)^i_j \gamma_5 \xi^j,
\label{eq:killingspeq-1} \\
  \partial_\mu \xi^i 
  &=& -\frac{\sigma'}{2} (\sigma_3)^i_j \gamma_\mu \xi^j 
     - \frac{\sigma'}{2} \gamma_5 \gamma_\mu \xi^i.
\label{eq:killingspeq-2}
\end{eqnarray}
%
These equations show that a $U(1)_R$ subgroup of $SU(2)_R$ remains 
unbroken in the AdS background.  The constraint on $\xi^i$, 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:basicboundarycondition}), now becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  (\sigma_3)^i_j \xi^j = \gamma_5 \xi^i \qquad 
  \mbox{at } y=0 \mbox{ and } \pi R.
\label{eq:xi-cond}
\end{equation}
%
These three equations define global supersymmetry in the truncated 
AdS$_5$ on $S^1/Z_2$. The form of the bulk Lagrangian is determined by
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:killingspeq-1},~\ref{eq:killingspeq-2}). 
The Killing spinor boundary constraint of Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond}) 
is crucially important when we consider the effect of the boundaries 
in the next sub-section. In particular it requires that 
$\xi_{R\alpha} = 0$ at both boundaries.

Finally, we write down the off-shell bulk Lagrangians (in 
the basis where the Killing spinor equations take the form of
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:killingspeq-1},~\ref{eq:killingspeq-2})).
Effects of boundaries, including Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond}), will be 
considered in the next sub-section.  We begin with a hypermultiplet, 
which consists of two complex scalars, $\phi^1$ and $\phi^2$, and 
a Dirac spinor, $\Psi$, and two complex auxiliary fields, $F^1$ 
and $F^2$. The kinetic part of the action is given by
%
\begin{equation}
  {\cal S}_{\rm hyp.kin.} 
    \equiv \int\!\!d^4x \int\!\!dy \, \sqrt{-g} \, {\cal L}_{\rm hyp.kin.},
\label{eq:def-s}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
  {\cal L}_{\rm hyp.kin.}
    = -g^{MN} \partial_M\phi^*_i \partial_N\phi^i
      -\frac12 \bar{\Psi} \gamma^M \partial_M\Psi
      +\frac12 \partial_M\bar{\Psi} \gamma^M \Psi
      +F^*_iF^i + \frac{15}{4}k^2 \phi^*_i\phi^i,
\label{eq:hyperaction}
\end{equation}
%
where $i=1,2$ and both $\phi^i$ and $F^i$ are doublets under $SU(2)_R$; 
in particular $\phi_i=\epsilon_{ij}\phi^j$, $\phi^*_i=(\phi^i)^*$, 
and so on. This action is invariant under the following global 
supersymmetry transformation:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  && \delta\phi^i 
    = \sqrt2 \epsilon^{ij}\bar{\xi}_j\Psi, 
\nonumber\\
  && \delta\Psi 
    = \sqrt2 \left( \gamma^M \xi^i \partial_M\phi_i 
        - \frac32 \sigma' \xi^i \phi_j (\sigma_3)^j_i 
        + \xi^i F_i \right),
\label{eq:hypertrans}\\
  && \delta F^i 
    = \sqrt2 \epsilon^{ij}\left( \bar{\xi}_j \gamma^M \partial_M\Psi 
        - 2\sigma' \bar{\xi}_j \gamma_5 \Psi \right),
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the global supersymmetry transformation parameter $\xi^i$ 
satisfies Eqs.~(\ref{eq:killingspeq-1},~\ref{eq:killingspeq-2}).
In addition to the above kinetic part, Eq.~(\ref{eq:hyperaction}), 
we can also add a mass to the hypermultiplet:
%
\begin{equation}
  {\cal L}_{\rm hyp.mass} 
  = - c \sigma' \bar{\Psi} \Psi 
    + c \sigma' (F^*_i\phi^i + \phi^*_iF^i)
    - ck^2 (\sigma_3)^i_j \phi^*_i \phi^j,
\label{eq:hypermass}
\end{equation}
%
where $c$ is a dimensionless real constant. This by itself 
is invariant (up to a total derivative) under the global 
supersymmetry transformation, Eqs.~(\ref{eq:hypertrans}) with 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:killingspeq-1},~\ref{eq:killingspeq-2}).

The gauge supermultiplet consists of a vector field $A_M$, a Dirac 
gaugino $\Psi_\lambda$, a real scalar $\Sigma$, and three real 
auxiliary fields $X^a$ ($a=1,2,3$). The Lagrangian is given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  {\cal L}_{\rm gauge}
    &=& \frac{1}{g^2} \biggl[ -\frac{1}{4}g^{ML}g^{NK}F_{MN}F_{KL}
      -\frac12 g^{MN} \partial_M\Sigma \> \partial_N\Sigma
      -\frac12 \bar{\lambda}_i \gamma^M \partial_M\lambda^i
      +\frac12 X^a X^a 
\nonumber\\
  && {} +2k^2 \Sigma^2 
      -\frac14 \sigma' (\sigma_3)^i_j \bar{\lambda}_i \lambda^j \biggr],
\label{eq:gaugelag}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where we have chosen the gauge group to be $U(1)$ for simplicity.
We have also used the symplectic Majorana notation for the gaugino: 
$\Psi_\lambda$ is represented by the two Dirac spinors $\lambda^1$ 
and $\lambda^2$.  Note that the gaugino and the auxiliary fields 
form a doublet and a triplet, respectively, under $SU(2)_R$. 
This Lagrangian is supersymmetric under the following global 
supersymmetry transformation:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  && \delta A_M = -\bar{\xi}_i\gamma_M\lambda^i,
\nonumber\\
  && \delta \Sigma = i \bar{\xi}_i\lambda^i,
\nonumber\\
  && \delta \lambda^i = -i\gamma^M\xi^i \partial_M\Sigma
    -\frac12 \gamma^M\gamma^N \xi^i F_{MN}
    +2i\sigma'\Sigma(\sigma_3)^i_j\xi^j
    -i(\sigma_a)^i_j \xi^j X^a,
\label{eq:gaugetrans}\\
  && \delta X^a = i\bar{\xi}_i\gamma^M\partial_M\lambda^j (\sigma^a)^i_j
    -2i\sigma' \bar{\xi}_i\gamma_5\lambda^j (\sigma^a)^i_j,
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $\xi$ satisfies the condition 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:killingspeq-1},~\ref{eq:killingspeq-2}).
Generalization to a non-Abelian group is fairly straightforward 
(giving the appropriate gauge structure, adding certain 
gaugino-gaugino-scalar interactions, changing the derivatives 
to gauge covariant derivatives, and so on).  These bulk Lagrangians, 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:hyperaction},~\ref{eq:hypermass},~\ref{eq:gaugelag}), 
reproduce the on-shell bulk Lagrangians given in 
Refs.~\cite{Shuster:1999zf}, after integrating out the auxiliary 
fields (assuming no boundaries).

\subsection{Effects of the boundaries}
\label{subsec:boundary}

In this sub-section we consider the effects of the boundaries.
We follow the discussion in section~\ref{sec:defect} and consider 
the symmetry structure of the theory.  A new ingredient compared 
with the previous case is the constraint coming from the Killing 
spinor equation, Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond}).  This additional complication 
arises from the fact that supersymmetry is a spacetime symmetry. 
The other parts of the discussion, however, are quite analogous 
to the previous case.

We begin by considering the boundary conditions on the fields. 
As explained in the previous section, the boundary conditions are 
written as Eq.~(\ref{eq:bc-fields}), where $\varphi$ is a column 
vector collecting all the fields in the theory, including the metric 
$g_{MN}$.  Since the matrices $\mbox{\bf{Z}}$ and $\mbox{\bf{Z}}'$ must 
be representations of the two reflections ${\cal Z}: y \rightarrow -y$ 
and ${\cal Z}': y' \rightarrow -y'$, respectively, they must obey 
the relations:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mbox{\bf{Z}}^{2} = {\bf 1}, \qquad
  \mbox{\bf{Z}}^{\prime 2} = {\bf 1}.
\label{eq:zz-z'z'}
\end{equation}
%
Thus we find that the general boundary conditions are given as 
follows. Under the reflection ${\cal Z}$, the fields obey 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  && \phi^i(y) = P_\Phi U^i_j (\sigma_3)^j_k \phi^k(-y),
\nonumber\\
  && \Psi(y) = P_\Phi \gamma_5 \Psi(-y),
\label{eq:hyperparity}\\
  && F^{i}(y) = P_\Phi U^{i}_j (\sigma_3)_k^j F^k(-y),
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
and
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  && A_\mu(y) = A_\mu(-y), \qquad A_5(y) = -A_5(-y),
\nonumber\\
  && \lambda^i(y) = U^i_j (\sigma_3)^j_k \gamma_5 \lambda^k(-y),
\nonumber\\
  && \Sigma(y) = -\Sigma(-y),
\label{eq:gaugeparity}\\
  && X^a(y) = \frac12{\rm tr}
    [\sigma^aU\sigma^3\sigma^b\sigma^3U^\dagger]X^b(-y),
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $U = \exp[2\pi i(\alpha_1\sigma_1+\alpha_2\sigma_2)]$ with $0 \leq 
\alpha_{1,2} < 1$, and each hypermultiplet can have its own 
parity $P_\Phi = \pm 1$.  The boundary conditions under ${\cal Z}'$ 
is also given similarly, by the replacement $y \rightarrow y'$, 
$U \rightarrow U'$ ($\alpha_{1,2} \rightarrow \alpha'_{1,2}$) 
and $P_\Phi \rightarrow P'_\Phi$ in 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:hyperparity},~\ref{eq:gaugeparity}), 
where $0 \leq \alpha'_{1,2} < 1$ and $P'_\Phi = \pm 1$.\footnote{
Here we have assumed the boundary conditions do not break the gauge
symmetry, although including such breaking is straightforward. The 
procedure is exactly identical to that in flat space.}

Now, we study the supersymmetry structure of the theory: 
a conservation law for the supercurrent. Following the discussion 
in section~\ref{sec:defect}, we consider the Noether procedure 
in the path integral formalism. What position dependence should 
we allow for the supersymmetry transformation parameter, and 
how many supersymmetries are preserved in each point in the extra 
dimension?  First, we can easily see that there are 4D $N=2$ 
supersymmetries in the bulk, because in any local neighborhood 
of the bulk we can solve the Killing spinor equation, 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:killingspeq-1},~\ref{eq:killingspeq-2}), as 
$\xi^1(x^\mu,y) = \exp(-\sigma\gamma_5/2) (1 - \sigma'\exp(\sigma)
\gamma_\mu x^\mu (1-\gamma_5)/2) \xi_0$, which is parameterized by 
an arbitrary constant Dirac spinor $\xi_0$. A non-trivial question 
is the number of supersymmetries on the boundaries.  At the 
boundaries $y=0$ and $\pi R$, the supersymmetry transformation 
parameter must obey the condition Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond}).
On the other hand, the boundary conditions for the fields, 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:hyperparity},~\ref{eq:gaugeparity}) implies that 
the supersymmetry transformation parameter must obey
%
\begin{equation}
  \xi^i(y)  = U^i_j (\sigma_3)^j_k \gamma_5 \xi^k(-y), \qquad
  \xi^i(y') = U^{\prime i}_j (\sigma_3)^j_k \gamma_5 \xi^k(-y'),
\label{eq:orbixi}
\end{equation}
%
to preserve the boundary conditions of the fields. The number of 
supersymmetries on the boundaries is then determined by these two 
conditions, Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond},~\ref{eq:orbixi}).

Let us focus on the $y=0$ boundary (the discussion for the $y=\pi R$ 
boundary is identical).  We first consider the case $\alpha_1 
= \alpha_2 = 0$.  In this case, Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond}) and 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:orbixi}) become identical; in other words, the Killing 
spinor equation does not give an additional constraint on the 
transformation parameter $\xi^i$ beyond the one arising from the 
boundary conditions, Eq.~(\ref{eq:orbixi}).  This situation 
is similar to the $SU(5)$ example discussed in 
sub-section~\ref{subsec:type1-defect}.  In fact, we find 
that the $y=0$ brane is supersymmetry breaking defect of 
type~I, on which the 4D $N=2$ supersymmetry in the bulk is 
broken to 4D $N=1$. The number of supersymmetries can easily be 
understood from Eq.~(\ref{eq:orbixi}): $\xi^i(y) = (\sigma_3)^i_j 
\gamma_5 \xi^j(-y)$ requires half of $\xi^i$ to vanish at $y=0$. 
A defect of type~I implies that the symmetries can be consistently 
gauged, {\it i.e.} the theory can be embedded into supergravity. 
In supergravity, the gravitino $\psi_{3/2}$ obeys the boundary 
conditions analogous to Eq.~(\ref{eq:orbixi}). Thus, when expanded 
into 4D modes, the number of $\psi_{3/2}$'s and the number of 
$\xi$'s are the same (there is no need to impose any extra constraint 
on the gravitino field), ensuring the consistency of the theory with 
local supersymmetry.  In particular, if we choose $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 
= \alpha'_1 = \alpha'_2 = 0$, the resulting theory possesses unbroken 
4D $N=1$ supersymmetry, whose transformation parameter is given 
by $\xi^1(x^\mu,y) = \exp(-\sigma/2)\xi_L$ where $\xi_L$ is 
a spinor (dependent on coordinates in supergravity) subject to 
the condition $\gamma_5 \xi_L = \xi_L$.  The explicit realization 
of this case in the context of supergravity has been extensively 
studied~\cite{Altendorfer:2000rr}.

We next consider the case where either $\alpha_1$ or $\alpha_2$ is 
non-zero. In this case Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:orbixi}) 
give different conditions, and we find that the solution to both 
equations is only the trivial one, $\xi^i = 0$.  This implies that 
we do not have any supersymmetry on the $y=0$ brane.  Since the 
constraint $\xi^i(y=0) = 0$ is an extra condition imposed on $\xi$, 
additional to the one arising from the boundary conditions, 
the situation is similar to the $U(1)$ example discussed in 
sub-section~\ref{subsec:type2-defect} with $\xi^i(y=0)=0$ 
corresponding to Eq.~(\ref{eq:u1-gtp-const}). The defect is type~II 
and does not allow gauging of the supersymmetry of the theory.
The argument is similar to the previous $U(1)$ case. When we gauge 
supersymmetry, we must introduce the gravitino field and impose 
boundary conditions like Eqs.~(\ref{eq:orbixi}). Since the 
gravitino is a dynamical field, we cannot impose any additional 
constraint by hand.  This implies that the number of $\xi$'s is one 
smaller than that of $\psi_{3/2}$'s (in the 4D picture) due to 
the extra constraint $\xi^i(y=0)=0$. Since the consistent treatment 
of a spin-$3/2$ field requires a supersymmetry, this leads to 
an inconsistency; for instance, in such theories ghosts can be 
physically produced and certain scattering amplitudes lead to negative 
probabilities (the presence of such ghosts was also noted in 
Ref.~\cite{Gherghetta:2002nr}).

Why do we insist on gauging supersymmetry?  If supersymmetry were 
not a spacetime symmetry, we would be able to consider only global 
supersymmetry. We would be able to use arbitrary values for 
$\alpha_{1,2}$ and $\alpha'_{1,2}$ to construct models, in 
which supersymmetry is broken by boundary conditions.  However, 
supersymmetry {\it is} spacetime symmetry.  When we include gravity, 
we have to consider supergravity, in which supersymmetry is gauged.
This means that the boundaries at $y=0$ and $\pi R$ must be symmetry 
breaking defects of type~I: $\alpha_{1,2}$ and $\alpha'_{1,2}$ must 
be zero.  Therefore, we arrive at the following conclusion. 
{\it In AdS$_5$ the compactification on $S^1/Z_2$ is unique: 
we cannot use boundary conditions to break all bulk supersymmetries 
in a warped extra dimension}.

Nevertheless, in the next section we consider models on the truncated 
AdS$_5$ in which supersymmetry is broken by boundary conditions. 
As mentioned at the end of sub-section~\ref{subsec:type2-defect}, 
we do this because some theories can mimic certain properties of the 
theory with boundary condition supersymmetry breaking.  For instance, 
consider a theory with $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha'_1 = \alpha'_2 
= 0$ and break supersymmetry spontaneously by the expectation value 
for the $F$-component of a brane-localized chiral superfield $Z$ 
at $y=\pi R$. Then, if this expectation value is large (we formally 
take $F_Z \rightarrow \infty$), we find that some properties of 
the boundary condition breaking, such as strict relations between 
supersymmetry breaking masses and the KK mass scale, are 
recovered~\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2001mi}. Thus, although the models 
presented in section~\ref{sec:model} do not allow consistent inclusion
of gravity as they are, we think that it is worthwhile constructing some 
representative models and exploring their phenomenology.

We note that the case of supersymmetry breaking by boundary conditions
in flat space is now very simple to analyze. The Killing spinor
equations become trivial, with $\xi^i$ becoming constant for a global
transformation; crucially there is no Killing spinor constraint at the
boundary, such as Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond}).  Therefore, the issue we have 
in AdS space, {\it i.e.} the incompatibility of Eq.~(\ref{eq:orbixi}) 
with Eq.~(\ref{eq:xi-cond}), does not exist in flat space.  Thus, 
any choices for the matrices $U^i_j$ and $U^{\prime i}_j$ in 
Eq.~(\ref{eq:orbixi}) yield type~I defects at both boundaries, where 
each boundary preserves a single 4D supersymmetry, with the orientation 
of the supersymmetry in $SU(2)_R$ space depending on the parameter 
$\alpha$ relevant at that boundary. The entire system preserves 
a supersymmetry in 4D only if the two boundaries preserve the same 
supersymmetry, $\alpha = \alpha'$, otherwise supersymmetry is completely 
broken by the boundary conditions. If either boundary is allowed to 
have a Lagrangian which is not invariant under any supersymmetry, the 
resulting $N=0$ defect is of type~II, so that the resulting theories 
are inconsistent with supergravity. 

Finally in this section, we complete the Lagrangian in the case of 
$\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = \alpha'_1 = \alpha'_2 = 0$.  The bulk Lagrangian 
of Eqs.~(\ref{eq:hyperaction},~\ref{eq:hypermass},~\ref{eq:gaugelag}) 
is not invariant under the supersymmetry transformation at $y=0$ 
and $\pi R$.  For instance, when we vary the hypermultiplet action 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:def-s},~\ref{eq:hyperaction}), we find that the terms 
that spoil invariance appear from $\partial_y$ acting on $\sigma'$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{-g}\delta{\cal L}_{\rm hyp.kin.} 
    = \sqrt{-g}\left[\cdots 
    + \frac32 \sigma''\sqrt2 \bar{\Psi}\xi^i\phi_i + \mbox{h.c.} \right],
\end{equation}
%
where $\sigma'' = 2k(\cdots+\delta(y)-\delta(y-\pi R)+\cdots)$. 
However, these terms can be canceled if we add brane mass terms 
for the scalars:
%
\begin{equation}
  {\cal L}_{\rm hyp.kin.} \rightarrow 
  {\cal L}_{\rm hyp.kin.} - \frac32 \sigma'' \phi^*_i \phi^i.
\end{equation}
%
This gives the correct supersymmetric Lagrangian on AdS$_5$ 
compactified on $S^1/Z_2$. A similar analysis for 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:hypermass},~\ref{eq:gaugelag}) leads to 
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  && {\cal L}_{\rm hyp.mass} \rightarrow 
  {\cal L}_{\rm hyp.mass} + c \sigma'' (\sigma_3)^i_j \phi^*_i \phi^j,
\\
  && {\cal L}_{\rm gauge} \rightarrow
  {\cal L}_{\rm gauge} - \frac{1}{g^2} \sigma'' \Sigma^2.
\end{eqnarray}
%
After integrating out the auxiliary fields, these Lagrangians agree 
with the on-shell Lagrangian given in Ref.~\cite{Gherghetta:2000qt}.

\subsection{Warped constrained standard model}
\label{subsec:wcsm}

Consider an $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ supersymmetric gauge
theory on truncated AdS$_5$ space. Each 4D boundary is necessarily a
defect in the space of supersymmetries, since the two bulk supersymmetries
cannot coexist on a 4D boundary. In the last section we have shown that 
if both defects are of type~I, then the supersymmetries preserved at 
each boundary must align with each other, so that the entire system
preserves a 4D supersymmetry.  To break supersymmetry by boundary
conditions, we must consider supersymmetry breaking by means of 
a defect of type~II.  Furthermore, we assume that the Planck brane 
located at $y=0$ is a type~I defect preserving one supersymmetry, since, 
if it were type~II, all supersymmetries would be broken at the Planck 
scale.\footnote{
We could instead choose the Planck brane to be a type~II defect, if 
we localize the Higgs fields to the TeV brane. Such a construction 
can lead to theories where there is a little hierarchy between the 
electroweak and new physics scales~\cite{Gherghetta:2003wm}.}
Therefore the TeV brane at $y=\pi R$ must be of type~II, so that 
couplings on this brane explicitly break all supersymmetries.

The field content and boundary conditions are chosen to be identical 
to those of the constrained standard model \cite{Barbieri:2000vh}, 
so that gauge, matter, and a single Higgs hypermultiplet all propagate 
in the bulk. Since there is a single zero-mode Higgs boson, we 
expect a Higgs sector far more constrained than that of the MSSM. 
The supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions are those of 
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:hyperparity},~\ref{eq:gaugeparity}) with $\alpha'_2=1/2$, 
$\alpha_{1,2} = \alpha'_1 = 0$ and $P_{\rm matter}=P'_{\rm matter}=+1$, 
$P_{\rm Higgs}=-P'_{\rm Higgs}=+1$.  The mass spectrum for both 
matter-like and Higgs-like boundary conditions are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:spectrum}. While these boundary conditions are identical 
to those of the flat space constrained standard model, we stress 
that in that theory both boundary defects were of type~I preserving 
orthogonal supersymmetries, so that the structure of supersymmetry 
breaking differs greatly in the warped case. We assume that all matter 
hypermultiplets have a bulk mass $c_M=1/2$, ensuring that the quark 
and lepton zero modes are conformally flat. This is analogous to the 
flat space theory in the absence of bulk masses. We expect that 
deviations from $c_M= 1/2$ would be analogous to introducing bulk 
masses in the flat case~\cite{Marti:2002ar}. To obtain a predictive 
theory of electroweak symmetry breaking with a single Higgs boson, 
the Higgs must propagate in the bulk. If we had instead placed the 
Higgs boson on the Planck brane, then 4D supersymmetry on that brane 
would have prevented it from generating down-type masses.  If we had 
placed it on the non-supersymmetric TeV brane, the quartic coupling 
would be arbitrary and there would be no prediction for the physical 
Higgs boson mass.  A bulk Higgs boson, however, is able to generate 
up-type masses at the $y=0$ brane and all masses at the $y=\pi R$ 
brane, and to a large extent radiative corrections are controlled 
by the unbroken bulk supersymmetry.

The bulk mass for the Higgs hypermultiplet, $c$, is still free as 
is the Higgs boson brane mass term at the TeV brane ${\cal L} 
= r'(\phi^{1*}\phi^{1}) 2k\delta(y-\pi R)$, where $\phi^{1}$ is 
the first component of a complex $\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ doublet and gauge 
indices are contracted.  These two parameters in turn determine the 
profile of the Higgs boson KK modes in the bulk, and the tree-level 
mass of the Higgs boson KK modes.  In particular the lightest mode 
mass is approximately given by:
%
\begin{equation}
  m_{\rm tree} 
    \simeq 2 \sqrt{(c^2-1/4)\frac{3/2-r'-c}{5/2-r'+c}}
      \left( \frac{t}{k}\right) ^{c-1/2}t,
\end{equation}
%
for $(t/k)^{c-1/2} \ll 1$, where $t=e^{-k\pi R}k$ is the scale of 
physics at the $y=\pi R$ brane. An important result is that for 
$c>1/2$ the tree-level mass is much smaller than the typical KK mass 
scale $t$ so that the full Higgs mass parameter becomes only weakly 
sensitive to $r'$. This is because the lowest level wavefunction is 
strongly peaked around the $y=0$ brane. Therefore, while we have 
no knowledge of the TeV brane parameters (and radiative corrections 
to some of these parameters are even power divergent), the low energy 
physics is largely insensitive to their values.

Since the tree level mass of the Higgs boson rapidly becomes 
small for $c>1/2$, electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered 
radiatively via the top Yukawa coupling, which we assume to be 
located dominantly on the Planck brane.  As discussed in 
section~\ref{subsec:boundary}, the supercurrent is conserved 
locally in the bulk, so radiative effects must respect supersymmetry 
there.  Therefore, supersymmetry guarantees that the bulk Higgs 
mass is not renormalized. Thus, as in models of boundary condition 
supersymmetry breaking on flat extra dimension, we expect corrections 
to the 4D Higgs boson mass to be finite, except for the contribution 
from the $y=\pi R$ brane, which we have argued is small. Therefore, 
by taking $r'$ to be the renormalized brane mass we are able to 
calculate the physical Higgs mass in terms of $c$ and $r'$. 
We have computed radiative corrections from the top quark Yukawa 
coupling to the Higgs boson effective potential. After minimizing 
this effective potential, the mass scale of the KK modes is 
determined from $M_Z$, and the resulting prediction for the Higgs 
boson mass is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsmass}, for a range of 
$c$ and for three values of $r'$.  The insensitivity to $r'$ as $c$ 
increases above $1/2$ is striking, but not unexpected as in this 
region the tree-level mass effectively vanishes.  For the same reason, 
the physical Higgs boson mass becomes constant for large $c$ at about 
$100~{\rm GeV}$.  One might worry that direct searches rule out 
a single Higgs boson with mass less than $115~{\rm GeV}$, and the 
model requires a large degree of fine tuning to reach such a mass. 
However, since $r'$ is not the only TeV brane operator that affects 
the Higgs mass, we expect that there are $O(15\%)$ corrections 
to our calculation.  For example, there can be additional quartic 
interactions, top Yukawa couplings and terms involving the $F$-fields 
of the matter multiplets, on the TeV brane. Although all of these 
terms are suppressed by the wavefunction overlaps of the various 
fields with the TeV brane and thus introduce only small corrections, 
they can give non-negligible effects on the physical Higgs boson mass; 
for example, a brane-localized quartic coupling is expected to 
introduce a $\simlt 15\%$ correction in the physical Higgs mass in the 
limit of strong coupling. Therefore, taking note of these possible 
corrections, the model is not ruled out for a reasonably wide range 
of parameter space. Notice that for a given $r'$, electroweak symmetry 
is not broken for all $c$.  Below a certain $c$, the radiative 
corrections are unable to overcome the positive tree level mass
squared and electroweak symmetry breaking does not occur. Thus the 
curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsmass} end at these points.

%
Taking $c>1/2$ also leads to light Higgsinos. The lightest Higgsino 
mass is approximately
%
\begin{equation}
  m_{\tilde{h}} \simeq 2\sqrt{c^2 -1/4}\left( \frac{t}{k}\right) ^{c-1/2}t.
\end{equation}
%
Notice that no brane mass term can be written for the Higgsinos because
$\tilde{h}^{1}$ vanishes at $y=\pi R$.  The masses of the lightest
neutralino and lightest chargino therefore place a bound on $c$. 
However, this bound is weak because it depends on the size of the 
brane-localized kinetic term for $\tilde{h}^{2}$
%
\begin{equation}
  S_{4} = -\int d^{4}x
    (k/t)^{-1}Z\bar{\tilde{h}}^{2}\partial_{\mu}\hat{\gamma}^{\mu}
    \tilde{h}^{2}\left( \eta_{\tilde{h}^{2}}(\pi R) \right)^2,
\end{equation}
%
where indices are raised and lowered with $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ and 
$\hat{\gamma}^{\mu}$ are the four dimensional Dirac gamma matrices. 
$\eta_{\tilde{h}^{2}}(y)$ is the wavefunction of the lightest 
right-handed Higgsino. If we consider the dimensionless combination 
$z=Z(k/t)^{-1}\left( \eta_{\tilde{h}^{2}}(\pi R)\right) ^2$ we find 
that the four dimensional kinetic term for the lightest $\tilde{h}^{2}$ 
has a coefficient $\simeq 1+z$ and that going to canonical normalization 
the lightest Higgsino mass is
%
\begin{equation}
  m_{\rm canonical} \simeq \frac{m_{\tilde{h}}}{\sqrt{1+z}}.
\end{equation}
%
Notice that the strong peaking of the wavefunction enhances the effect 
due to the brane kinetic term, so that a correction to the Higgsino 
mass of order unity is expected.  As an example, we show in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:nlsp} the lightest chargino and neutralino for the 
case that $z=-0.75$ and $r'=-1$, though there is only weak sensitivity 
to $r'$.  In this case, the chargino mass is not ruled out by direct 
searches for $c \simlt 0.55$. 

By introducing a type~II supersymmetry breaking defect on a warped 
background, we are able to construct a predictive theory of electroweak 
symmetry breaking with one Higgs doublet. The theory requires 
a moderate peaking of the Higgs boson on the $y=0$ brane, which could 
be the origin of the $m_t/m_b$ ratio. While the Higgs boson is expected 
to be close to its experimental limit of $115~{\rm GeV}$, a precise 
prediction is not possible because of the degree of peaking of the 
Higgs boson wavefunction and the supersymmetry breaking interactions 
on the TeV brane. The lightest chargino and neutralino are also close 
to their experimental bounds.

\subsection{Twisted warped grand unified theory}
%







While the theory just described has logarithmic running of gauge
couplings up to the mass scale of the Planck brane, it is not a
theory of gauge coupling unification, since nothing in the theory
requires the bulk gauge couplings to be unified.  In order to
construct such a theory we must consider a model in which the bulk
Lagrangian is symmetric under some grand unified group.  Here we 
consider an $SU(5)$ supersymmetric gauge theory on a slice of 
$\mathrm{AdS}_5$.  We take the warped supersymmetric grand unified 
theory of Ref.~\cite{Goldberger:2002pc}, with all matter and Higgs 
in the bulk, and break the $SU(5)$ symmetry by boundary conditions 
imposed at the Planck brane.  Each generation contains 
${\cal F}: \{ F(\bar{\bf 5}), F^c({\bf 5}) \} + {\cal F}': 
\{ F'(\bar{\bf 5}), F^{\prime c}({\bf 5})\}$ and 
${\cal T}: \{ T({\bf 10}), T^c(\bar{\bf 10})\} + {\cal T}': 
\{ T'({\bf 10}), T^{\prime c}(\bar{\bf 10})\}$ where 
$\Phi(R)$ represents a chiral supermultiplet in the $R$ 
representation of $SU(5)$. There are, in addition, two Higgs 
hypermultiplets ${\cal H}: \{ H({\bf 5}), H^c(\bar{\bf 5})\}$ and 
$\bar{\cal H}: \{ \bar{H}(\bar{\bf 5}), \bar{H}^{c}({\bf 5})\}$.
In this model, the boundary conditions are given such that each brane 
is a symmetry breaking defect of type~I with respect to supersymmetry.
The Planck brane is additionally a symmetry breaking defect of type~I
with respect to the gauge group, breaking $SU(5) \rightarrow SU(3)_C
\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. The TeV brane respects the full $SU(5)$
group. (The boundary conditions for some of the bulk fields are 
given explicitly in Table~\ref{fig:notwist}.)  The zero-mode particle 
content of the model is the same as in the MSSM, while the KK towers 
consist of $SU(5)$ symmetric particles of masses around TeV.  It was 
shown in \cite{Goldberger:2002pc} that, if all bulk fields carry 
$c \geq 1/2$, only the zero modes contribute to the differential 
gauge coupling running, so that the model leads to the same beta 
functions as in the MSSM.  Therefore, despite the drastic departure 
from the MSSM particle content at the TeV scale, the theory preserves 
logarithmic gauge coupling unification at a high scale.

With the boundary conditions described above, both branes are defects 
of type~I respecting the same 4D $N=1$ supersymmetry, so that there 
exists unbroken $N=1$ supersymmetry in the low-energy 4D theory. 
One way of breaking this remaining supersymmetry is to consider 
a supersymmetry breaking VEV located on the TeV brane. Instead, here 
we consider breaking the remaining supersymmetry by modifying the 
boundary conditions such that the brane at $y=\pi R$ becomes a 
supersymmetry breaking defect of type~II, as in the previous 
sub-section.  This is accomplished by introducing non-zero $\alpha'$ 
parameters in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:hyperparity},~\ref{eq:gaugeparity}). 
Without loss of generality, we can take $\alpha'_1=\alpha_{1,2}=0$.
We here choose the supersymmetry breaking parameter $\alpha'_2=1/2$.
We also choose $P'_{\rm Higgs}=-1$ so that there are light Higgs 
scalars from the Higgs hypermultiplets.

We first consider the effect of the supersymmetry breaking twist, 
$\alpha'_2 \neq 0$, on the matter multiplets.  Here, the net effect 
is that the parity under $y' \rightarrow -y'$, $Z'$, changes sign 
for the $SU(2)_R$ doublet scalars. As a consequence, the MSSM sfermions 
no longer possess a zero mode while their first KK modes appear at 
$O(\mathrm{TeV})$.  However, a new scalar zero mode now appears. 
As shown in Tables~\ref{fig:twist} and \ref{fig:zeromodes}, these 
scalars are related to the standard model fermions by the broken 
generators of $SU(5)$ and by the supersymmetry broken at the Planck 
brane.  We will call these the $SU(5)$, $N=2$ partners of the standard 
model fermions.  Notice that a full generation will possess both a 
fermion and a scalar with conjugate quantum numbers.  Therefore, 
mere observation of quantum numbers and the mass spectrum (before 
electroweak symmetry breaking) could mimic the presence of an unbroken 
supersymmetry.  However, the fermion and scalar originate from 
different hypermultiplets and thus there is no supersymmetry that 
relates the two.  For example, the two fields will not be coupled 
by the gauginos.  The extra bosonic fields can be made heavy by mass 
terms located on the $y=\pi R$ brane.  In order for these fields 
to become sufficiently heavy their wavefunctions must have 
a sizable overlap with the TeV brane.  This translates into 
the requirement that $c_{\rm matter} \geq 1/2$, in accordance 
with the requirement for gauge coupling unification and stability 
of the proton~\cite{Goldberger:2002pc}.  The resulting masses are 
naturally in the TeV region.\footnote{
The extra scalars can also obtain masses through radiative corrections 
from gaugino masses. In the case where these masses are sufficiently 
large, we do not necessarily satisfy the conditions $c_{\rm matter} 
\geq 1/2$ to make these fields heavy, and the scalar mass squareds 
are one-loop smaller than the supersymmetry breaking scale $\sim t^2$.}

In the Higgs sector, because of the change in sign of $P'_{\rm Higgs}$ 
in addition to the supersymmetry breaking twist, the $Z'$ parities of 
the fermions change sign.  As a result, the doublet Higgsino becomes 
heavy. However, as in the matter sector, the $SU(5)$, $N=2$ partners 
of the two Higgs bosons, a pair of color triplet fermions, now possess 
zero modes. Again, as in the matter sector, these unwanted fields can be 
made massive via a TeV brane localized mass term: a Dirac mass for the 
two colored Higgsinos. Again, to give sufficient mass for the undesired 
states, the wavefunction overlaps of these states with the TeV brane 
must be sizable, requiring $c_{\rm Higgs} \geq 1/2$. Note that larger 
values of $c_{\rm Higgs}$, $c_{\rm Higgs} > 1/2$, have the added 
benefit of minimizing the influence of the supersymmetry breaking 
brane on the Higgs bosons as discussed in the previous sub-section. 
We expect electroweak symmetry breaking to proceed much like in the
previous sub-section including the issue of too light Higgsino 
doublets. To illustrate the effects of the supersymmetry breaking
boundary conditions, both the zero and non-zero modes of the $\bf 5$'s 
and $\bar{\bf 5}$'s of the $F$,$F'$ matter and Higgs fields are 
shown in Tables~\ref{fig:notwist} and \ref{fig:twist} both before 
and after the supersymmetry breaking twist.

We finally consider the gauge sector. This sector has a quite similar 
structure to the Higgs sector. The boundary condition twist at $y=\pi R$, 
$\alpha'_2=1/2$, acts on the $SU(2)_R$ doublets, so the $Z'$ parities 
for the gauginos change sign. The MSSM gauginos become heavy while the 
$SU(5)$, $N=2$ partners of the gauge bosons are made light by the 
supersymmetry breaking twist. However, these undesired fields can 
gain masses via a mass term on the TeV brane.  In the case of the 
gauge multiplets the bulk mass is required to be $c_{\rm gauge}=1/2$ 
by gauge invariance, and thus the zero-mode fermions have conformally 
flat wavefunctions, insuring that they have sizable wavefunction 
overlaps with the TeV brane.

Now, we consider the effect of supersymmetry breaking twist, 
$\alpha'_2 \neq 0$, on the gauge coupling unification. A theory 
on the truncated AdS$_5$ space has a different description in terms 
of a 4D quasi-conformal field theory~\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2000ds}. 
In this dual 4D picture, changing the boundary conditions at the 
TeV brane corresponds to changing the TeV physics, so that it can 
be viewed as an IR effect.  Therefore, the boundary condition breaking 
twist at the TeV brane is expected not to change the differential 
running above the TeV scale, and the model is expected to preserve the 
successful prediction for $\sin^2\theta_w$~\cite{Goldberger:2002pc}. 
This expectation can be confirmed by direct calculation of the beta 
functions with the twists, $\alpha'_2 = 1/2$ and $P'_{\rm Higgs} = -1$, 
using the formulae found in Ref.~\cite{Choi:2002ps}. Notice, however, 
that there is no energy range in which our theory mimics the MSSM 
particle content. If the brane mass terms are smaller than the 
KK mass gap, then the first new particles to be created will 
include the $SU(5)$, $N=2$ partners of the standard model particles. 
These include colored Higgsinos and gauginos of the broken $SU(5)$ 
generators. If the brane mass terms are larger than the KK mass gap, 
then the first new particles to be created will be the first KK mode 
which contains many states in addition to those of the MSSM. The model 
makes the same prediction for $\sin^2 \theta_w$ as the MSSM, despite 
these drastic departures from the MSSM particle content at the TeV scale.

We may also wish to maintain the feature of gauge coupling unification 
in the context of a theory with one Higgs doublet. In this case, 
it is easiest to return to the situation before the supersymmetry 
breaking twist was made. We can then imagine removing the 
$\{ \bar{H}(\bar{\bf 5}), \bar{H}^c({\bf 5})\}$, which contained 
the $\bar{H}({\bf 1},{\bf 2})_{-1/2}$ Higgs doublet as a zero mode. 
This change in the zero-mode particle content will change the beta 
function; we therefore also remove the $\{ F(\bar{\bf 5}), 
F^{c}({\bf 5})\}$ that had contained the third generation 
$F(\bar{\bf 3},{\bf 1})_{1/3}$.  The sum of these two zero-mode fields 
contribute to the differential running of the gauge couplings the 
same as a single $\bar{\bf 5}$, and therefore their removal does 
not affect gauge unification.  We will not worry about the missing 
$b_{R}$ at this stage; it will reappear after we break the remaining 
$N=1$ supersymmetry.

Now let us consider the $\bf 5$'s and $\bar{\bf 5}$'s of the third 
generation matter and Higgs fields after breaking supersymmetry. 
Notice that the $SU(5), N=2$ partner of the remaining Higgs
boson ({\it i.e.} the $\psi^c_{++}$ component of the ${\cal H}$ 
hypermultiplet) is a fermion with the same quantum numbers as $b_{R}$. 
We may identify this field as the right-handed bottom quark thereby 
completing the third generation. This identification points out the
fact that there no longer exists any distinction between Higgs-like
and matter-like boundary conditions.  Instead, we have unified matter
and Higgs in the context of an $SU(5)$ model: from the 5D point of 
view the quantum numbers and boundary conditions for the ${\cal H}$ 
hypermultiplet and the two ${\cal F}$ hypermultiplets are the same.
There are three potential Higgs bosons, each one an $SU(5),N=2$ 
partner of a right-handed down-type quark.  However, since the 
${\cal H}$ hypermultiplet has the bulk mass parameter such that 
the zero-mode doublet scalar is localized toward the Planck brane 
while the zero-mode scalars from the ${\cal F}$ hypermultiplets 
are localized to the TeV brane, it is natural that only two of these 
scalars receive $O(\mathrm{TeV})$ masses from the $y=\pi R$ brane, 
leaving one light Higgs doublet. This light Higgs field will develop 
an electroweak breaking expectation value through radiative corrections, 
as in the previous models. Therefore, we can naturally obtain the 
theory with logarithmic gauge coupling unification, which effectively 
has only a single Higgs boson. Note that the Yukawa couplings for the 
up-type quarks can be located both on the Planck and TeV branes but 
those for the down-type quarks (and charged leptons) can be located 
only on the TeV brane.  Thus we naturally understand the origin of 
the $m_t/m_b$ ratio in this theory through a moderate peaking of the 
Higgs wavefunction toward the Planck brane.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper we have studied the properties of boundaries in higher 
dimensional theories that do not respect the full symmetries of 
the bulk.  Such defects break symmetries explicitly, but since all the 
breakings are localized on boundaries, local counterterms in the bulk 
are restricted in exactly the same manner as they would be in the 
absence of the defects.  In particular, the effects of explicit 
breaking are suppressed by the volume of the extra dimensions and/or 
small wavefunction overlaps in the low energy 4D theories. Therefore, 
symmetry breaking by point defects provides an interesting alternative 
to spontaneous symmetry breaking, in which we can systematically 
suppress the size of explicit breaking and can use the symmetry 
to control radiative corrections.

There are two different classes of symmetry breaking defects. 
A type~I defect possesses the maximum symmetry allowed by the boundary
conditions of the fields. Put another way, if the symmetry is made
local the boundary conditions of the gauge parameters and gauge fields
coincide.  The two therefore have the same KK decomposition, and there
exists a gauge transformation corresponding to each gauge field in the
4D theory. Such a theory can therefore be consistently gauged.  If 
a theory possesses a defect of type~II, then the symmetry may not be
gauged.  Type~II defects arise by requiring the brane Lagrangian to
be invariant under a smaller symmetry than that allowed by the
boundary conditions. In order to enforce this, one must impose
additional constraints on the symmetry transformation parameters at 
the boundaries. If one were to attempt to gauge such a theory, the
additional boundary conditions on the gauge parameters, as compared to
the gauge fields, would result in gauge fields without corresponding
gauge transformations.  This will therefore result in inconsistencies
such as states with negative norm. These results apply to any theory in 
which a symmetry is broken by boundary conditions on extra dimensions.

In particular, these ideas may be applied to supersymmetry 
breaking on a slice of $\mathrm{AdS}_5$.  In this case, the Killing
spinor equations result in a non-trivial constraint on the
supersymmetry transformation parameters at the boundaries of 
the space.  If only half of the supersymmetry is broken, reducing 
the four dimensional $N=2$ to $N=1$, then the Killing spinor
condition coincides with the conditions required by the boundary
conditions of the fields, and the boundaries become symmetry 
breaking defects of type~I.  However, if one attempts to break 
all of the supersymmetries, then the Killing spinor equations do 
in fact constitute an additional constraint and at least one boundary 
must be a type~II defect.  As a consequence, unlike flat space, 
breaking supersymmetry by boundary conditions on a warped background 
is not consistent with supergravity.

Despite this difficulty, we argue that a theory with supersymmetry
breaking boundary conditions may approximate a theory that is
consistent with gravity. We therefore presented two models that
make use of this mechanism. First, we constructed a theory of
electroweak symmetry breaking with a single Higgs doublet: a warped
version of the constrained standard model. Supersymmetry greatly
constrains the Higgs potential, while a bulk mass for the Higgs
hypermultiplet reduces the sensitivity to the dynamics of the
supersymmetry breaking brane.  As a result, we have succeeded in
constructing a predictive theory leading to a Higgs boson mass that 
may be close to its experimental lower bound.

In our second model we constructed a theory of gauge coupling
unification in which both the grand unified group and supersymmetry
are broken by boundary conditions on the same extra dimension. While
gauge coupling unification occurs as in the MSSM, the low energy
particle content may deviate drastically from that of the MSSM.
Depending on the mass parameters of the supersymmetry breaking brane,
it is possible that the lowest mass gaugino may be the super partner
of the broken gauge bosons. It is also possible that the lightest
Higgsinos are colored.  We have also shown that it is possible to 
remove the Higgs hypermultiplets from this model and identify the 
Higgs boson as one of the $SU(5), N=2$ partners of the right handed 
down-type quarks and in this way unify the Higgs and matter 
in the context of an $SU(5)$ grand unified theory.
