\caption{\label{fig3} Geometric picture of the areas associated with the quark and the antiquark; each is bounded by a portion of a circle and a straight line between the initial and final positions of the $q\bar{q}$ pair.}  The contributions of the straight lines cancel in the action, so that the action depends on the contour of the overall area.
