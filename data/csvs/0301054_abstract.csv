\baselineskip .4 true cm \noindent Pure gauge representation for
general vacuum background fields (Cartan forms) in the generalized
$AdS$ superspace identified with $OSp(L,M)$ is found. This allows
us to formulate dynamics of free massless fields in the
generalized $AdS$ space-time and to find their (generalized)
conformal and higher spin field transformation laws. Generic
solution of the field equations is also constructed explicitly.
The results are obtained with the aid of the star product
realization of  ortosymplectic superalgebras.
