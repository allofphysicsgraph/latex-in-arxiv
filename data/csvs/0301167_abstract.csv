Calculations of the two-loop $\beta$-function for $N=1$ supersymmetric
electrodynamics are compared for regularizations by higher derivatives
and by the dimensional reduction. The renormalized effective action are
found to be the same for both regularizations. However, unlike the
dimensional reduction, the higher derivative regularization does not
lead to anomaly puzzle, because it allows to perform correct calculation
of diagrams with insertions of counterterms. In particular, using this
method a contribution of diagrams with insertions of counterterms is
calculated exactly to all orders. This contribution appears to be 0 if
the theory is regularized by the dimensional reduction. We argue, that
this result follows from mathematical inconsistency of the dimensional
reduction and is responsible for the anomaly puzzle.
