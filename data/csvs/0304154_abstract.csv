By defining an extended BRST operator that includes the chiral part of N=2 global supersymmetry, it is shown that the
full N=2 off-shell Super Yang Mills Action can be represented as an exact BRST term. The action written in this form
suggests that the fields of the Topological Yang Mills theory can be defined in terms of composite fields of
supersymmetry ghosts and N=2 fields in a natural way. Topological Yang Mills theory is obtained from the ordinary
Euclidean N=2 SYM directly as field redefinitions without using twisting procedure. With the help of these results,
relation between the recent instanton calculations in N=2 Super Yang Mills  and Topological Yang Mills theories is also
discussed.
