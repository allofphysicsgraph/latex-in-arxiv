\item{If $\p \Sigma$ is connected, then there exist a neighbourhood of $\Sigma$ which is
diffeomorphic to an open subset of $n$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""om 
spacetime (extreme or non-extreme).}
\item{If $\p \Sigma$ is not connected ad moreover we have 
fulfilled the following inequality:
\be
\forall_{i, j}~ Q_{i}Q_{j} \ge 0,

where $Q_{i}$ is the charge of the adequate component of 
$\p \Sigma$, that intersects the degenerate horizon, then there is
an open neighbourhood of $\Sigma$ which is diffeomorphic to $n$-dimensional
Majumdar-Papapetrou spacetime.}
