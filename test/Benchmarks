counting Inline expressions
Correct count is 261


the binary can be made in the postings_list directory 
time ./inline_counts.out
	counts:261

real	0m0.005s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.003s


time python texSoup.py
time spent reading file
0.0001423358917236328
count
236

real	0m1.053s
user	0m1.032s
sys	0m0.020s


The time comparision isn't fair in this case, but need to compare the difference in output. Why are there 270 results vs 261. 
latexml sound1.tex
real	0m8.286s
user	0m8.100s
sys	0m0.184s

The difference in counts 
  Comments are parsed as a para in latexml. 
  LaTeXML is has a wide variety of configurations available, so it is likely possible to tokenize the inline math found in comments.

  Another issue related to the counts is in the figure. Seems like the inline math found in the figure starting on line 147 is represented twice in the xml document. 

grep '<Math mode="inline".*?>' output  -oP|sort|uniq|wc -l





yields 270
