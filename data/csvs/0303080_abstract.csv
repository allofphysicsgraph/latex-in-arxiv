    In these lecture notes I give an introduction to deformation
    quantization. The quantization problem is discussed in some detail
    thereby motivating the notion of star products. Starting from a
    deformed observable algebra, i.e. the star product algebra,
    physical applications require to study representations of this
    algebra. I review the recent development of a representation
    theory including techniques like Rieffel induction and Morita
    equivalence. Applications beyond quantization theory are found in
    noncommutative field theories.
