\caption{{\it Typical quiver  diagram.} The bosonic $(\Phi)$ and 
fermionic 
$(\Psi)$ fields corresponding to zero-modes of open strings with ends on 
branes 
are schematically represented by arrows. The figure corresponds to  the 
non-supersymmetric case 
$\tilde a_1\equiv 2a_4\equiv 2a_1,$.}

contours are displayed  as seen in the orbifold plane. The full ($resp.$ dashed) 
curve correspond to the  dominant ($resp.$ first subdominant) contribution 
to the potential (see subsection 4.2).}
