and the set of lines each onto itself is called an \emph{orthogonal
collineation} if it preserves incidence and orthogonality.
\"
1,"\begin{definition} Planes which are representable as an isomorphic
image, with respect to incidence and orthogonality, of the group plane of a
group of motions $(\mathfrak{G},\mathcal{G}),$\ are called metric planes.
\"
2,"\begin{definition} Three lines are said to lie in a pencil if their
product is a line; {\it i.e.}, $a,b,c$\ lie in a pencil if 
%
\begin{equation}
abc=d \in \mathcal{G} \quad . \label{pencil}
\end{equation}
\"
3,"\begin{definition} Given two lines $a,b$\ with $a\neq b,$\ the set
of lines $c$ satisfying equation (\ref{pencil}) is called a pencil of
lines and is denoted by $G(ab)$, since it depends only on the product
$ab.$
\"
4,"\begin{definition} A collineation is a one-to-one map of the set of
points onto the set of points and a one-to-one map of the set of lines onto
the set of lines that preserves the incidence relation.
\"
5,"\begin{definition} A perspective collineation is a collineation which
leaves a line pointwise fixed --- called its axis --- and a point 
line-wise fixed --- called its center.
\"
6,"\begin{definition} A homology is a perspective collineation with
center a point $B$\ and axis a line $b$\ where $B$\ is not incident with $b.$
\"
7,"\begin{definition} A harmonic homology with center $B$\ and axis $b,$\
where $B$\ is not incident with $b$, is a homology which relates each point $%
A$\ in the plane to its harmonic conjugate with respect to the two points $B$%
\ and $(b,[A,B]),$\ where $[A,B]$\ is the line joining $A$\ and $B$\ and $%
(b,[A,B])$\ is the point of intersection of $b$\ and $[A,B].$
\"
8,"\begin{definition} A complete quadrangle is a figure consisting of
four points (the vertices), no three of which are collinear, and of the six
lines joining pairs of these points. If $l$\ is one of these lines, called a
side, then it lies on two of the vertices, and the line joining the other
two vertices is called the opposite side to $l$. The intersection of two
opposite sides is called a diagonal point.
\"
9,"\begin{definition} A point $D$\ is the harmonic conjugate of a point $%
C $\ with respect to points $A$\ and $B$\ if $A$\ and $B$\ are two vertices
of a complete quadrangle, $C$\ is the diagonal point on the line joining $A$%
\ and $B,$\ and $D$\ is the point where the line joining the other two
diagonal points cuts $[A,B].$\ One denotes this relationship by $H(AB,CD).$
