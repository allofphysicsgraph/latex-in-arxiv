The hamiltonian quantum dynamical structures in the Gel'fand triplets
of spaces constructed in preceding installments in this series of
articles are shown to possess strictly
alternative representations by either fermionic or bosonic states.
A covering construction is given explicitly 
in terms of the properties of Clifford algebras appropriate to
different numbers of fields.  The unitary Clifford algebra
is constructed from the intersection of the orthogonal and common
symplectic Clifford (Weyl) algebras of the canonical phase space and
its complexification, establishing a well defined spin geometry for a
subset of the symplectic (dynamical) Clifford algebra. The unitary
Clifford algebra is used as the vehicle to define dynamical gauge
bundles and dynamical gauge semigroups for two, three and four fields.
The canonical dynamical gauge group for four fields is 
$SU(4)\times SU(3)$.  Charmed
quarks are thereby predicted in the fermionic representations of our
four field gauge theory.  An isomorphism  
exists from a subset of the gauge structure for four fields to a
subset of the orthogonal Clifford algebra of a non-trivial spacetime
with $(+,-,-,-)$ local signature, demonstrating probable compatibility
with general relativity.
