 \item The complete degeneracy of the doublet $r-1$ state
 at level $\delta^r_{r-1}=1-4/N$ (see Eq.~(\ref{levelall})).
 Note that we have here supposed that those of the remaining $r-2$ degeneracy
 conditions that act at levels strictly between $0$ and $\delta^r_{r-1}$ are
 such that these levels become empty after factoring out the corresponding
 degenerate submodules (or at least that no indirect ways of descending
 to level $\delta^r_{r-1}$ exist). Under this assumption, there remains
 only the two direct ways of descending to level $\delta^r_{r-1}$:
 \beq
  A^{-1}_{-\delta^r_{r-1}} \Phi^{r} \quad \mbox{and} \quad
  A^{-2}_{-\delta_{r-1}^{r}} \Phi^{-r}. \label{twostat}
 \eeq
 However, the commutation relation $\{\Psi^{-1},\Psi^{-1}\} \Phi^{-r}$
 of Eq.~(\ref{qdif}), with $n=1$ and $m=0$, shows that these two states
 are in fact proportional to one another.
 In order to have degeneracy at level $\delta_{r-1}^{r}$, it thus suffices
 to require that the state
 \beq
  \chi^{r-1}_{-\delta_{r-1}^{r}}\equiv A^{-1}_{-\delta_{r-1}^{r}}\Phi^{r}
  \label{stateD2}
 \eeq
 be primary. This condition then fixes the eigenvalue $h_r$ (see below).
 \item A degeneracy of the doublet $r$ state at level 1. We here suppose
 that those of the remaining $r-2$ degeneracy conditions that act at levels
 strictly between $\delta^r_{r-1}$ and 1 are such that these levels become
 empty after factoring out the corresponding degenerate submodules.
 If this is so, we can produce a degenerate state of a form
 analogous to Eq.~(\ref{Z7chilev1})
 \beq
  \chi^{r}_{-1}=a L_{-1}\Phi^{r}+bA^{-1}_{-1}\Phi^{-r}. \label{chidrlev1}
 \eeq
 Demanding the primarity of this state then fixes
 $\Delta_{\Phi^r}$ (see below).
