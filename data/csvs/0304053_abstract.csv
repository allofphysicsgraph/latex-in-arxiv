We perform a systematic study of the one-loop renormalizability of all 
Poisson-Lie T-dualizable $\si$-models with two-dimensional targets. We 
show that whatever Drinfeld double and whatever matrix of coupling 
constants we consider the corresponding $\si$-model is always one-loop 
renormalizable in the strict field theoretical sense. Moreover, in all 
cases, the RG flow in the space of the coupling 
constants is compatible with the Poisson-Lie T-duality.
