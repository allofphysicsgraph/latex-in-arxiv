\caption{The top figure is a series of snapshots of tachyon time
evolution processes but since time is not explicit, the role of
the S-brane is obscured.  The bottom left figure is essentially
just a redrawing of the top figure.  The bottom right figure
shows the entire dynamical evolution process with the S-branes
outlined.  The $T=0$ regions are drawn in as dashed lines. The
main point is that at late times we have remnants with tachyon
value zero and we can produce them from generic initial
conditions. S-branes are how we ``connect the lines'' from the
initial to final stage.  } \label{Sbrane-spacetimecombo}

\includegraphics[width=10cm]{remnantchart3.eps} \caption{Time
evolution processes characterized by S-branes. The S-branes are
the arrows. The upper three arrows starting from the non-BPS
D$p$-brane will be treated in Sections 3,4 and 6 respectively.
Although the S-branes from the non-BPS brane basically have
counterparts in the D$p$-$\overline{{\rm D}p}$, the arrows
emanating from the D$p$-$\overline{{\rm D}p}$ include processes
previously unknown, especially the ones mediated by tachyonic
S-branes.  All arrows are commonly expected both in type IIA and
IIB string theories.  Finally, to understand the creation of
D-strings, it is necessary to incorporate M-theory effects as
indicated in the bottom figure and discussed in Section 4.

processes characterized by S-branes.  The three pictures on the
left characterize the rolling tachyon picture so the S-brane
appears only when the tachyon crosses the top of the potential.
The second three pictures give a schematic of remnant creation. We
start off with some energy in the tachyon and perhaps in other
fields.  As the tachyon rolls, at some point it starts to create
$T=0$ regions specified by the thick lines which eventually turn
into remnants. At late times, the tachyon does not roll (no
velocity arrow) as all the energy has been transferred into the
remnant kink.} \label{pullingremnant}

\caption{The figure on the right is a schematic cross section of
tachyon values on the non-BPS brane which gives rise to a decaying
S-brane.  To the left we have included snapshots of the tachyon
values at specific times.  At early times the tachyon
configuration is changing but an S-brane has not appeared.  The
S-brane then appears, coming in from infinity, and then slows
down to metamorphose into a D-brane. The tachyon configuration is
not a kink or lump but more like an infinite well. Time dependent
kinks do not necessarily leave spatial kink remnants. Related
discussion can be found in Section \ref{bsas} and \ref{sadi}.}
