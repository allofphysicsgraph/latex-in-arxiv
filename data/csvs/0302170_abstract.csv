Suggested correspondence between a black hole and a highly excited 
elementary string is explored. Black hole entropy is calculated by
computing the density of states for an open excited string.  We identify the
square root of  oscillator number of the excited string with Rindler
energy  of black hole to obtain 
an entropy  formula which, not only agrees at the leading order with the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, but also reproduces the logarithmic 
correction obtained for black hole entropy in the quantum geometry 
framework. This provides an additional supporting evidence for
correspondence between black holes and strings.
