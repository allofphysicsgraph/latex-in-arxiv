The purpose of the ``bootstrap program'' for integrable quantum field theories
in 1+1 dimensions is to construct a model in terms of its Wightman functions
explicitly. In this article, this program is mainly illustrated in terms of
the sine-Gordon and the sinh-Gordon model and (as an exercise) the scaling
Ising model. We review some previous results on sine-Gordon breather form
factors and quantum operator equations. The problem to sum over intermediate
states is attacked in the short distance limit of the two point Wightman
function for the sinh-Gordon and the scaling Ising model.
