We introduce a gauge invariant and string independent two-point fermion correlator 
which is analyzed in the context of the Schwinger model ($QED_2$). We also derive an effective infrared worldline action for this correlator, thus enabling the computation of its infrared behavior. Finally, we briefly discuss possible perspectives for the string independent correlator in the $QED_3$ effective models for the normal state of HTc superconductors.
