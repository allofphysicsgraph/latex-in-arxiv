We derive  equations of motion  for the tachyon field living on an
unstable non-BPS D-brane in  the level truncated  open cubic
superstring field theory in the first non-trivial approximation.
We construct a special time dependent solution to this equation
which describes the rolling tachyon.
It starts from the perturbative vacuum and  approaches   one of
stable vacua  in infinite time.
We investigate conserved energy functional and show that its different parts
dominate in different  stages of the evolution.
We show that the
pressure for this solution has its minimum at zero time and
goes to minus energy at infinite time.
