We construct new intersecting S-brane solutions in
11-dimensional supergravity which do not have 
supersymmetric analogs. They are obtained by letting
brane charges to be proportional to each other. 
Solutions fall into two categories with respect to whether there is a 
non-diagonal term to be cancelled in the field equations or not. In each 
case we show that they can be constructed by using a simple set 
of rules which is similar to the harmonic function rule of the usual 
static 
p-branes. Furthermore, we study an intersection where the Chern-Simons 
term 
makes a non-zero contribution to the field equations. We show that this 
configuration has a singularity like other S-branes.
