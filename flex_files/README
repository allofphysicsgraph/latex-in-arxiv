copy any tex files that you want to parse latex from into this directory.

run make

several csv files will be generated with output from flex

REGENERATE_ALL_FLEX_SCRIPTS.sh
	will generate a small subset of the flex files listed in the bash script. 
	anything that you modidfy from the base template, you will want to exclude from the list or it will be overwritten. 
	but (****hopefully****) should be saved in the folder flex_scripts_backup just in case.
