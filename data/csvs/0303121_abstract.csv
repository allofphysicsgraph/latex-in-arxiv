 We determine ${\cal N}=4$ partition functions
 of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills gauge theory 
 for some $ADE$ gauge groups on $K3$,
 under the assumption that they are holomorphic.
 Our partition functions satisfy the gap condition
 and Montonen-Olive duality at the same time,
 like the $SU(N)$ partition functions of Vafa and Witten.
 As a result we find a close relation between
 Hecke operator and $S$-duality of ${\cal N}=4$
  super Yang-Mills for $ADE$ gauge group
 on $K3$.
