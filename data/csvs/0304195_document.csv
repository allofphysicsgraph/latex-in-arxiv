%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We propose a useful method for deriving the effective theory 
for a system where BPS and anti-BPS domain walls coexist. 
Our method respects an approximately preserved SUSY near each wall. 
Due to the finite width of the walls, SUSY breaking terms arise at tree-level, 
which are exponentially suppressed. 
A practical approximation using the BPS wall solutions is also discussed. 
We show that a tachyonic mode appears in the matter sector 
if the corresponding mode function has a broader profile 
than the wall width.

\section{Introduction}
{\it Supersymmetry} (SUSY) is one of the most promising candidate 
for the solution to the hierarchy problem. 
When you construct a realistic model, however, SUSY must be broken 
because no superparticles have been observed yet. 
Thus, considering some SUSY breaking mechanism is an important issue 
for the realistic model-building. 
However, conventional SUSY breaking mechanisms are somewhat complicated 
in four dimensions \cite{ADS}. 

On the other hand, the {\it brane-world scenario}, which was originally 
proposed as an alternative solution to the hierarchy problem \cite{ADD,RS}, 
has been attracted much attention and investigated in various frameworks. 
It is based on an idea that our four-dimensional (4D) world is embedded 
into a higher dimensional space-time\footnote{The original idea along 
this direction was proposed in Ref.\cite{akama}. 
}. 
The 4D hypersurface on which we live is generally called a {\it brane}, 
and it can be a D brane (a stack of D branes) in the string theory 
or a topological defect in the field theory like a domain wall, 
vortex, monopole and so on. 
Recently, in spite of its original motivation of solving 
the hierarchy problem, the extra dimensions are utilized 
in order to explain various phenomenological problems, 
such as the fermion mass hierarchy \cite{arkani,kaplan}, 
the proton stability \cite{arkani}, 
the doublet-triplet splitting in the grand unified theory \cite{maru} 
and so on. 
In particular, the brane-world scenario can provide some simple mechanisms 
of SUSY breaking. 
One of them is a mechanism where SUSY is broken by the boundary conditions 
for the bulk fields \cite{AMQ}.\footnote{
Its basic idea was first proposed in Ref.\cite{scherk}. }

There is another interesting SUSY breaking mechanism, 
which utilizes {\it BPS objects}. 
They are the states that saturate the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) 
bound \cite{BPS}, and preserve part of the bulk SUSY. 
%BPS objects, such as a D brane, are important because they can naturally 
%realize a dimensinonal reduction to lower dimensions 
%and the partial SUSY breaking to 4D $\cN=1$ SUSY, which is relevant to 
%the phenomenology, simultaneously.  
By using the (BPS) D branes, for example, we can break 
SUSY in a very simple way. 
This mechanism is called {\it pseudo-supersymmetry}~\cite{klein} or 
{\it quasi-supersymmetry}~\cite{cremades}. 
In this mechanism, the theory has two or more sectors 
in which different fractions of the bulk SUSY are preserved, 
and all of it are broken in the whole system. 
One of the simplest examples is a system where parallel D3 brane and 
anti-D3 brane coexist with a finite distance. 
(See Fig.\ref{pseudoSUSY}.) 
Since each brane preserves an opposite half of the bulk SUSY, 
SUSY is completely broken in this system. 
A 4D effective theory for such a system can be derived by using 
the technique of the nonlinear realization for the space-time 
symmetries~\cite{klein}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the field theoretical context, 
there is a similar SUSY breaking mechanism to the pseudo-supersymmetry. 
In this mechanism, SUSY is broken due to the coexistence of 
two {\it BPS domain walls} which preserve 
opposite halves of the bulk SUSY \cite{MSSS2,MSSS,EMSS}. 
Therefore, the corresponding field configuration is non-BPS. 
We will refer to such a non-BPS configuration 
as a {\it wall-antiwall configuration} in this paper. 
One of the main differences from the pseudo-supersymmetry is 
that the BPS walls have a finite width unlike the D-branes. 
Due to this wall width, SUSY breaking terms arise at tree-level 
in contrast to the pseudo-supersymmetry scenario 
where they are induced by quantum effects. 
In general, such a non-BPS configuration is unstable \cite{MSSS2}. 
However, we can construct a stable wall-antiwall configuration 
by introducing a topological winding around the target space 
of the scalar fields \cite{MSSS}. 

When you discuss the phenomenological arguments on the wall-antiwall 
background, we need to derive a low-energy effective theory on it. 
If we eliminate the auxiliary fields of the superfields at the first step, 
the procedure of integrating out the massive modes becomes very complicated 
\cite{HLW}. 
In the case of the BPS-wall background, this complication can be avoided 
by keeping a half of the bulk SUSY preserved by the wall to be manifest, 
{\it i.e.}~by expanding the bulk superfields directly 
into lower-dimensional superfields 
for the unbroken SUSY \cite{sakamura1}.  
In the case of the wall-antiwall background, however, such a way out 
cannot be applied because there is no SUSY preserved in the whole system. 
Therefore, it is difficult to derive the effective theory 
on such a background correctly. 
In Ref.\cite{MSSS}, only mass-splitting between boson and fermion in 
each supermultiplet is calculated 
with the help of the low-energy theorem~\cite{lee,clark}.\footnote{
Some other SUSY breaking terms were also estimated in Ref.\cite{MSSS}, 
but they were only part of the whole terms.}
%should be corrected as we will see in this paper.}

In this paper, we will propose a useful method for 
deriving the effective theory in the wall-antiwall system. 
To avoid inessential complications, we will consider three-dimensional 
(3D) walls in a 4D bulk theory throughout this paper. 
Our method respects the approximately supersymmetric structure 
near the walls, and the resultant Lagrangian is written by 
the 3D superfields and the SUSY breaking terms. 
We can calculate {\it all SUSY breaking parameters} systematically 
in our method. 
%By our method, we can calculate all parameters in the effective theory 
%as overlap integrals involving the background field configuration and 
%the mode functions of the relevant modes. 
Using this method, we will show that a tachyonic mode appears 
in the effective theory from the matter sector 
if the corresponding mode function has a broader profile 
than the wall width. 
We will also provide an approximation method using the BPS wall solutions. 
This approximation is useful as a practical method
because the BPS wall solutions can easily be found than the non-BPS ones. 

In the superstring theory, it is well-known that 
BPS D-branes can be described by the kink solutions 
in the field theory of the tachyon \cite{MZ}. 
In particular, a D$p$ brane and anti-D$p$ brane pair is described 
as a wall-antiwall solution 
in an effective theory on a non-BPS D$(p+1)$ brane \cite{hashimoto}. 
Thus, our method can also be used 
in the discussion of the tachyon condensation \cite{tachyon} 
in the superstring theory. 

This paper is organized as follows. 
In the next section, we will provide useful expressions 
of the 4D bulk action, which respect opposite halves of the bulk SUSY. 
In Sect.\ref{nonBPSsys}, we will consider the wall-antiwall configuration 
and derive the 3D effective theory. 
%the mode-expansion of the bulk fields on it by using the formulae 
%derived in Sect.\ref{BPSformulae}, and derive the effective theory. 
A practical approximation method is provided in Sect.\ref{BPSapx}.  
In Sect.\ref{exmpl_model}, we will demonstrate our method 
in an explicit example of the stable wall-antiwall configuration.  
We will also discuss the gauge interactions in Sect.\ref{gauge_mpt}. 
Sect.\ref{summary} is devoted to the summary and the discussion. 
Notations and some useful properties of the classical background 
are listed in the appendices. 

%In the case that the brane is a topological defect, it is often useful 
%to consider SUSY theories as a fundamental theory. 
%Moreover, SUSY theories in a higher dimensional space-time 
%are a natural possibility in the superstring theory. 


\section{Useful expressions of the bulk action} \label{BPSformulae}
We will consider the following Wess-Zumino model as a 4D ${\cal N}=1$ bulk theory. 
\begin{equation}
 S=\int\!\!{\rm d}^4 x{\rm d}^2\theta{\rm d}^2\bar{\theta}\: \bar{\Phi}\Phi
 +\int\!\!{\rm d}^4 x{\rm d}^2\theta\: W(\Phi)+\int\!\!{\rm d}^4 x{\rm d}^2\bar{\theta}\: \bar{W}(\bar{\Phi}), 
 \label{WZmodel}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
 \Phi(y^\mu,\theta)=A(y^\mu)+\sqrt{2}\theta\Psi(y^\mu)+\theta^2F(y^\mu) \;\;\;\;\;
 (y^\mu\equiv x^\mu+i\theta\sigma^\mu\bar{\theta}) 
\end{equation}
is a chiral superfield. 

Here, we decompose the Grassmann coordinates $\theta$ and $\bar{\theta}$ 
as\footnote{
The notations of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are different from those 
in Refs.\cite{sakamura1}.} 
\begin{equation}
 \theta^\alpha = \frac{e^{iPdelta/2}}{\sqrt{2}}(\theta_2^\alpha+i\theta_1^\alpha), \;\;\;
 \bar{\theta}^{\dot{\alpha}} = \frac{e^{-iPdelta/2}}{\sqrt{2}}(\theta_2^\alpha-i\theta_1^\alpha), 
 \label{tht_decomp}
\end{equation}
where $Pdelta$ is a constant phase. 
Corresponding to this decomposition, we also decompose the 
supercharges~$Q_\alpha$ and $\bar{Q}_{\dot{\alpha}}$ as 
\begin{equation}
 Q_\alpha = \frac{e^{-iPdelta/2}}{\sqrt{2}}(Q_{2\alpha}-iQ_{1\alpha}), \;\;\;
 \bar{Q}_{\dot{\alpha}} = -(Q_\alpha)^* = -\frac{e^{iPdelta/2}}{\sqrt{2}}
 (Q_{2\alpha}+iQ_{1\alpha}).  \label{Q_decomp}
\end{equation}
Then, it follows that 
\begin{equation}
 \theta Q+\bar{\theta}\bar{Q}=\theta_1Q_1+\theta_2Q_2. 
\end{equation}
Under the above decomposition, the 4D ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY algebra can be rewritten as 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left\{ Q_{1\alpha \right\},Q_{1\beta}}\!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \left\{ Q_{2\alpha \right\},Q_{2\beta}}
 =2\left( \gamma_{(3) \right)^m\sigma^2}_{\alpha\beta}P_m, \nonumber\\
 \left\{ Q_{1\alpha \right\},Q_{2\beta}}\!\!\!&=\!\!\!& -\left\{ Q_{2\alpha \right\},Q_{1\beta}}
 =-2i\left( \sigma^2 \right)_{\alpha\beta}P_2. 
\end{eqnarray}
This can be interpreted as the central extended 3D ${\cal N}=2$ SUSY algebra 
if we identify $P_2$ with the central charge. 

Now, if we perform an integration for $\theta_2$ in Eq.(\ref{WZmodel}), 
we can obtain the following expression \cite{sakamura1}. 
\begin{equation}
 S=\int\!\!{\rm d}^3x{\rm d}^2\theta_1{\rm d}x_2 \: 
 \left\{ D_1^\alpha\bar{\varphi \right\}^{(1)}D_{1\alpha}\varphi^{(1)}
 +{\rm Im}\left( 2\bar{\varphi \right)^{(1)}\partial_2\varphi^{(1)}+4e^{-iPdelta}W(\varphi^{(1)})}}, 
 \label{S_vph1}
\end{equation}
where $\partial_2\equiv\partial/\partial x_2$, 
$D_{1\alpha}\equiv \partial/\partial\theta_1^\alpha-i(\gamma_{(3)}^m\theta_1)_\alpha\partial_m$ 
is a covariant spinor derivative\footnote{
Throughout this paper, derivatives for Grassmann variables are regarded as 
left-derivatives.} for $Q_1$-SUSY, and 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \varphi^{(1)}(x^m,x_2,\theta_1)\!\!\!&\equiv\!\!\!& e^{\theta_1Q_1}\times A(x^m,x_2) \nonumber\\
 \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& A+e^{iPdelta/2}(\sigma^2)_{\alpha\beta}\theta_1^\alpha\Psi^\beta
 +\frac{i}{2}\theta_1^2(\partial_2 A+e^{iPdelta}F).  \label{def_vph1}
\end{eqnarray}
Throughout this paper, $m=0,1,3$ denotes the 3D Lorentz index, 
and the $x_2$-direction is chosen as the extra dimension. 
The relation between $\varphi^{(1)}$ and the original chiral superfield~$\Phi$ 
is given by 
\begin{equation}
 \Phi(y^\mu,\theta)=
 e^{-\theta_1\theta_2\partial_2}e^{-i\theta_2D_1+i\theta_2^2\partial_2}\varphi^{(1)}
 (x^m,x_2,\theta_1).  \label{Phi_vph1}
\end{equation}

On the other hand, if we perform an integration for $\theta_1$, Eq.(\ref{WZmodel}) 
becomes 
\begin{equation}
 S=\int\!\!{\rm d}^3x{\rm d}^2\theta_2{\rm d}x_2 \:
 \left\{ D_2^\alpha\bar{\varphi \right\}^{(2)}D_{2\alpha}\varphi^{(2)}
 +{\rm Im}\left( 2\bar{\varphi \right)^{(2)}\partial_2\varphi^{(2)}-4e^{-iPdelta}W(\varphi^{(2)})}}, 
 \label{S_vph2}
\end{equation}
where $D_{2\alpha}\equiv \partial/\partial\theta_2^\alpha-i(\gamma_{(3)}^m\theta_2)_\alpha\partial_m$ 
is a covariant spinor derivative for $Q_2$-SUSY, and 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \varphi^{(2)}(x^m,x_2,\theta_2)\!\!\!&\equiv\!\!\!& e^{\theta_2Q_2}\times A(x^m,x_2) \nonumber\\
 \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& A-ie^{iPdelta/2}(\sigma^2)_{\alpha\beta}\theta_2^\alpha\Psi^\beta
 +\frac{i}{2}\theta_2^2(\partial_2 A-e^{iPdelta}F). 
\end{eqnarray}
The relation between $\varphi^{(2)}$ and $\Phi$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
 \Phi(y^\mu,\theta)=
 e^{\theta_1\theta_2\partial_2}e^{i\theta_1D_2+i\theta_1^2\partial_2}\varphi^{(2)}
 (x^m,x_2,\theta_2).  \label{Phi_vph2}
\end{equation}

From Eqs.(\ref{Phi_vph1}) and (\ref{Phi_vph2}), we can obtain the relation 
between $\varphi^{(1)}$ and $\varphi^{(2)}$ as follows. 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \varphi^{(1)}(x^m,x_2,\theta_1) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \Phi|_{\theta_2=0} = e^{i\theta_1D_2+i\theta_1\partial_2}
 \varphi^{(2)}|_{\theta_2=0} \nonumber\\
 \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \varphi^{(2)}(x^m,x_2+i\theta_1^2,i\theta_1)  \label{rel_vph12}
\end{eqnarray}
In fact, we can explicitly show that 
\begin{eqnarray}
 && \int\!\!{\rm d}^2\theta_1{\rm d}x_2 \: 
 \left\{D_1^\alpha\left( \bar{\varphi \right)^{(2)}(x^m,x_2-i\theta_1^2,-i\theta_1)}
 D_{1\alpha}\left( \varphi^{(2) \right)(x^m,x_2+i\theta_1^2,i\theta_1)} \right. \nonumber\\
 && \hspace{2.5cm} \left.+{\rm Im}\left( 2\bar{\varphi \right)^{(2)}
 (x^m,x_2-i\theta_1^2,-i\theta_1)\partial_2
 \left( \varphi^{(2) \right)(x^m,x_2+i\theta_1^2,i\theta_1)}}\right\} \nonumber\\
 \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \int\!\!{\rm d}^2\theta_2{\rm d}x_2 \:
 \left\{ D_2^\alpha\bar{\varphi \right\}^{(2)}D_{2\alpha}\varphi^{(2)}
 +{\rm Im}\left( 2\bar{\varphi \right)^{(2)}\partial_2\varphi^{(2)}}}, 
 \label{K_vph1-vph2}
\end{eqnarray}
and 
\begin{equation}
 \int\!\!{\rm d}^2\theta_1{\rm d}x_2 \:
 {\rm Im}\left( e^{-iPdelta \right)W(\varphi^{(2)}(x^m,x_2+i\theta_1^2,i\theta_1))} 
 = \int\!\!{\rm d}^2\theta_2{\rm d}x_2 \:
 {\rm Im}\left( -e^{-iPdelta \right)W(\varphi^{(2)})}. 
 \label{W_vph1-vph2}
\end{equation}
Namely, we can derive Eq.(\ref{S_vph2}) by substituting Eq.(\ref{rel_vph12}) 
into Eq.(\ref{S_vph1}). 


\section{Wall-antiwall system} \label{nonBPSsys}
\subsection{Classical field configuration}
Let us assume that the bulk theory~(\ref{WZmodel}) has two supersymmetric 
vacua $A=A_{\rm I}$ and $A=A_{\rm II}$, and that there exists a BPS domain wall 
configuration~$A=A_{\rm cl1}(x_2)$ which interpolates between them. 
That is, 
\begin{equation}
 A_{\rm cl1}(-\infty)=A_{\rm I}, \;\;\; A_{\rm cl1}(\infty)=A_{\rm II},
\end{equation}
and $A_{\rm cl1}(x_2)$ satisfies a BPS equation 
\begin{equation}
 \partial_2 A_{\rm cl1}=e^{iPdelta}\bar{W}'(\bar{A}_{\rm cl1}),  \label{BPS_eq1}
\end{equation}
where a prime denotes a differentiation for the argument, and 
\begin{equation}
 Pdelta\equiv \arg\left( W(A_{\rm II})-W(A_{\rm I}) \right). 
\end{equation}
If we take this value of $Pdelta$ as that in the decompositions~(\ref{tht_decomp}) 
and (\ref{Q_decomp}), $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ correspond to the unbroken and 
broken supercharges respectively. 

When the theory has the BPS domain wall~$A_{\rm cl1}(x_2)$, 
it also has the ``anti-BPS'' domain wall~$A=A_{\rm cl2}(x_2)$. That is, 
\begin{equation}
 A_{\rm cl2}(-\infty)=A_{\rm II}, \;\;\; A_{\rm cl2}(\infty)=A_{\rm I}, 
\end{equation}
and the BPS equation for $A_{\rm cl2}(x_2)$ is 
\begin{equation} 
 \partial_2 A_{\rm cl2}=-e^{iPdelta}\bar{W}'(\bar{A}_{\rm cl2}).  \label{BPS_eq2}
\end{equation}
This anti-BPS wall preserves $Q_2$-SUSY and breaks $Q_1$-SUSY. 

Now we will consider a system in which the above two kinds of BPS walls 
coexist. 
Since the two walls preserve opposite halves of the bulk SUSY, 
All of it are broken in such a system. 
That is, a corresponding field configuration~$A_{\rm cl}(x_2)$ is non-BPS. 
Unlike the BPS wall, such a non-BPS configuration is usually unstable 
\cite{MSSS2}. 
However, we can construct a stable non-BPS configuration 
by introducing the topological winding around the target space of 
the scalar field~$A(x_2)$ \cite{MSSS}. 
We will discuss an explicit example of such a stable configuration 
in Sect.\ref{exmpl_model}. 
In the following, we will assume that the extra dimension ($x_2$-direction) 
is compactified on $S^1$ with radius~$R$. 

Furthermore, to simplify the discussions, we will also assume that 
the superpotential~$W$ has the following symmetric property\footnote{
This assumption is not essential for our method of deriving 
the effective theory. 
It is just a matter of convenience. 
}. 
\begin{equation}
 W'(A-A_{\rm M})=W'(A_{\rm M}-A),  \label{W_assumption}
\end{equation}
where $A_{\rm M}\equiv (A_{\rm I}+A_{\rm II})/2$ is a middle point between 
the two vacua on the target space. 
Under this assumption, the BPS and anti-BPS walls are located 
at antipodal points on $S^1$, and $A_{\rm cl}(x_2)$ has the following property. 
(See Fig.\ref{profile-Acl} in Sect.\ref{exmpl_model}.)
\begin{eqnarray}
 \partial_2A_{\rm cl}(x_2-\pi R) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \pm\partial_2A_{\rm cl}(x_2), \nonumber\\
 W'(A_{\rm cl}(x_2-\pi R)) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \mp W'(A_{\rm cl}(x_2)).  \label{piR_translation}
\end{eqnarray}
The upper signs in R.H.S correspond to 
the case of a stable configuration with the topological winding \cite{MSSS}, 
and the lower signs correspond to the case of an unstable configuration 
with no winding \cite{MSSS2}. 
From now on, we will choose the origin of the coordinate~$x_2$ 
so that the (approximate) BPS wall is 
located at $x_2=0$ and the anti-BPS wall is at $x_2=\pi R$. 


\subsection{Mode-expansion}
First, we will consider the mode-expansion of $\varphi^{(1)}$ in Eq.(\ref{S_vph1}). 
The classical background of $\varphi^{(1)}$ is 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)}(x_2,\theta_1) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& e^{\theta_1Q_1}\times A_{\rm cl}(x_2)
 =A_{\rm cl}(x_2)+\frac{i}{2}\theta_1^2\left( \partial_2A_{\rm cl}(x_2)+e^{iPdelta \right)F_{\rm cl}(x_2)} 
 \nonumber\\
 \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& A_{\rm cl}(x_2)+\frac{i}{2}\theta_1^2\left( \partial_2A_{\rm cl}(x_2)-e^{iPdelta \right)
 \bar{W}'(\bar{A}_{\rm cl}(x_2))}. 
\end{eqnarray}
Here we used the equation of motion for the auxiliary field~$F$ 
in the last equation. 

Similarly, the background of $\varphi^{(2)}$ is 
\begin{equation}
 \varphi_{\rm cl}^{(2)}(x_2,\theta_2) = e^{\theta_2Q_2}\times A_{\rm cl}(x_2) 
 =A_{\rm cl}(x_2)+\frac{i}{2}\theta_2^2\left( \partial_2A_{\rm cl}(x_2)+e^{iPdelta \right)
 \bar{W}'(\bar{A}_{\rm cl}(x_2))}. 
\end{equation}

The superfield equation of motion 
\begin{equation}
 -\frac{1}{4}\bar{D}^2\bar{\Phi}+W'(\Phi)=0 
\end{equation}
can be rewritten in terms of $\varphi^{(1)}$ as \cite{sakamura1}
\begin{equation}
 -\frac{1}{2}D_1^2\bar{\varphi}^{(1)}+i\partial_2\bar{\varphi}^{(1)}
 -ie^{-iPdelta}W'(\varphi^{(1)})=0. 
 \label{EOM_vph1}
\end{equation}
By substituting $\varphi^{(1)}=\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)}+\tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}$ into 
Eq.(\ref{EOM_vph1}) and using the equation of motion for $\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)}$, 
we can obtain the linearized equation of motion 
for the fluctuation field~$\tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}$ as 
\begin{equation}
 -\frac{1}{2}D_1^2\bar{\tilde{\varphi}}^{(1)}+i\partial_2\bar{\tilde{\varphi}}^{(1)}
 -ie^{-iPdelta}W''(\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)})\tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}
 =0.  \label{lin_EOM_vph1}
\end{equation}

Let us denote the component fields of $\tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}$ as 
\begin{equation}
 \tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}=a^{(1)}+\theta_1\psi^{(1)}+\frac{1}{2}\theta_1^2f^{(1)}. 
\end{equation}
Then, we can obtain the following linearized equation of motion 
for $\psi^{(1)}_\alpha$ by picking up linear terms for $\theta_1$ from 
Eq.(\ref{lin_EOM_vph1}). 
\begin{equation}
 -i\left( \gamma_{(3) \right)^m\partial_m\bar{\psi}^{(1)}}_\alpha
 +i\left\{ \partial_2\bar{\psi \right\}^{(1)}_\alpha-e^{-iPdelta}W''(A_{\rm cl})\psi^{(1)}_\alpha}
 =0. 
\end{equation}
Therefore, the mode equation for $\psi^{(1)}_\alpha$ can be read off as 
\begin{equation}
 i\left\{ \partial_2\bar{u \right\}^{(1)}_{(n)}-e^{-iPdelta}W''(A_{\rm cl})u^{(1)}_{(n)}}
 =m_{(n)}\bar{u}^{(1)}_{(n)},  \label{mode_eq1}
\end{equation}
where $m_{(n)}$ are eigenvalues. 
Note that this has a very similar form to that of the BPS-wall case 
\cite{sakamura1}. 
The only difference is that the argument of $W''$ is 
a non-BPS configuration~$A_{\rm cl}$, instead of $A_{\rm cl1}$. 
On the other hand, the mode equation for $a^{(1)}$ receives more corrections 
than that for $\psi^{(1)}_\alpha$ when you change the background 
from the BPS one to the non-BPS one. 
%\footnote{ 
%This is the case even if the K\""{a}hler potential is not minimal.} 
Therefore, it is convenient to use the mode functions of 
$\psi^{(1)}_\alpha$ in the following derivation of the 3D effective theory. 

To simplify the discussion, we will consider a case that 
$A_{\rm cl}(x_2)$ and all parameters of the 4D bulk theory are real. 
In this case, $Pdelta=0$ \footnote{
There is another possibility that $Pdelta=\pi$, but it can be reduced 
to the case of $Pdelta=0$ by the redefinition of the coordinate: 
$x_2\to x_2+\pi R$. 
} and the mode equation~(\ref{mode_eq1}) can be 
rewritten as  
\begin{eqnarray}
 \left\{ -\partial_2+W''(A_{\rm cl}) \right\}u_{{\rm R}(n)} \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& m_{(n)}u_{{\rm I}(n)}, \nonumber\\
 \left\{ \partial_2+W''(A_{\rm cl}) \right\}u_{{\rm I}(n)} \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& m_{(n)}u_{{\rm R}(n)},  \label{mode_eq2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $u_{{\rm R}(n)}(x_2)$ and $u_{{\rm I}(n)}(x_2)$ are defined by 
\begin{equation}
 u^{(1)}_{(n)}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(u_{{\rm R}(n)}+iu_{{\rm I}(n)}). 
\end{equation}
Using these mode functions, $\psi^{(1)}_\alpha$ can be expanded into 
3D fields as 
\begin{equation}
 \psi^{(1)}_\alpha(x^m,x_2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{n=0}^\infty
 \left( u_{{\rm R}(n \right)(x_2)\psi_{{\rm R)}(n)\alpha}(x^m)
 +iu_{{\rm I}(n)}(x_2)\psi_{{\rm I}(n)\alpha}(x^m)}. 
 \label{mode_expd_psi}
\end{equation}

Here, note that the mode equation~(\ref{mode_eq2}) has two zero-modes, 
\begin{eqnarray}
 u_{{\rm R}(0)}(x_2) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& C_0\,e^{\int_0^{x_2}\!{\rm d}y\:W''(A_{\rm cl}(y))}, 
 \nonumber\\
 u_{{\rm I}(0)}(x_2) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& C_0\,e^{-\int_{\pi R}^{x_2}\!{\rm d}y\:W''(A_{\rm cl}(y))}, 
 \label{zero_modes}
\end{eqnarray}
where $C_0$ is a common normalization factor. 
The corresponding fields~$\psi_{{\rm R}(0)}$ and $\psi_{{\rm I}(0)}$ are the goldstinos
for the broken $Q_2$- and $Q_1$-SUSY, and localized on the (approximate) 
BPS and anti-BPS walls, respectively. 
Therefore, it is convenient to introduce the following 3D superfields. 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \varphi^{(1)}_{(0)}(x^m,\theta_1) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& a^{(1)}_{(0)}(x^m)+\theta_1\psi_{{\rm R}(0)}(x^m)
 +\frac{1}{2}\theta_1^2f^{(1)}_{(0)}(x^m), \nonumber\\
 \varphi^{(2)}_{(0)}(x^m,\theta_2) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& a^{(2)}_{(0)}(x^m)+\theta_2\psi_{{\rm I}(0)}(x^m)
 +\frac{1}{2}\theta_2^2f^{(2)}_{(0)}(x^m).  \label{ap_sf1}
\end{eqnarray}

Considering Eqs.(\ref{rel_vph12}) and (\ref{mode_expd_psi}), 
the mode-expansion of the fluctuation field~$\tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}$ 
can be expressed as 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}(x^m,x_2,\theta_1) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
 \left\{ u_{{\rm R}(0 \right\)}(x_2)\varphi^{(1)}_{(0)}(x^m,\theta_1)+u_{{\rm I}(0)}(x_2+i\theta_1^2)
 \varphi^{(2)}_{(0)}(x^m,i\theta_1)} \nonumber\\
 &&+(\mbox{massive modes}).   \label{ap_mode-exp1}
\end{eqnarray}
Strictly speaking, the bosonic component of this expression deviates 
the correct mode-expansion 
because we used the mode functions of $\psi^{(1)}_\alpha$. 
However, this deviation is negligibly small when the distance 
between the walls is large enough\footnote{
In the BPS wall limit, the mode functions of bosonic and fermionic 
zero-modes approach to a common function.} 
On the other hand, the massive modes cannot be well described 
by using 3D superfields 
because they have broadly spread profiles along the $x_2$-direction 
and thus receive large SUSY breaking effects. 


\subsection{Derivation of 3D effective theory}
In the following, we will concentrate ourselves on the low-energy region 
where all massive modes are decoupled, and will drop them from expressions. 
By substituting the expression 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \varphi^{(1)}(x^m,x_2,\theta_1) \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)}(x_2,\theta_1) \nonumber\\
 &&+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left\{ u_{{\rm R}(0 \right\)}(x_2)\varphi^{(1)}_{(0)}(x^m,\theta_1)
 +u_{{\rm I}(0)}(x_2+i\theta_1^2)\varphi^{(2)}_{(0)}(x^m,i\theta_1)} 
\end{eqnarray}
into Eq.(\ref{S_vph1}) and carrying out the $x_2$-integration, 
we can obtain the 3D effective theory. 

A zero-th order term for the fields, {\it i.e.} the cosmological 
constant term, can be calculated as 
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\cal L}_{\rm cc}^{(3)} \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \int\!\!{\rm d}^2\theta_1{\rm d}x_2 \:
 \left\{ D_1^\alpha\bar{\varphi \right\}_{\rm cl}^{(1)}D_{1\alpha}\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)} 
 +{\rm Im}\left( 2\bar{\varphi \right)_{\rm cl}^{(1)}\partial_2\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)}
 +4W(\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)})}} \nonumber\\
 \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& -\int\!\!{\rm d} x_2\: \left\{ (\partial_2A_{\rm cl})^2+\left( W'(A_{\rm cl}) \right\ \right)^2} =-V_0,
 \label{Lcc}
\end{eqnarray}
where $V_0$ is an energy (per unit area) of the background 
field configuration~$A_{\rm cl}(x_2)$. 

Linear terms for the fields are cancelled due to 
the equation of motion for $\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)}$. 

Then, we will calculate quadratic terms for the fields. 
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\cal L}_{\rm quad}^{(3)} \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \int\!\!{\rm d}^2\theta_1{\rm d}x_2\:
 \left\{ D_1^\alpha\bar{\tilde{\varphi \right\}}^{(1)}D_{1\alpha}\tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}
 -2{\rm Im}\left( \tilde{\varphi \right)^{(1)}\left( \partial_2\bar{\tilde{\varphi \right)}^{(1)}
 -W''(\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)})\tilde{\varphi}^{(1)}}}} \nonumber\\
 \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \int\!\!{\rm d}^2\theta_1\:\frac{1}{2}\left( D_1\varphi^{(1) \right)_{(0)}}^2
 +\int\!\!{\rm d}^2\theta_2\:\frac{1}{2}\left( D_2\varphi^{(2) \right)_{(0)}}^2 \nonumber\\
 &&-\eta\left( f^{(1) \right)_{(0)}f^{(2)}_{(0)}
 +\partial^ma^{(1)}_{(0)}\partial_ma^{(2)}_{(0)}}
 -\frac{1}{2}m_0^2\left( a^{(1) \right)_{(0)}-a^{(2)}_{(0)}}^2, 
 \label{L_quad}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\eta \equiv \int{\rm d}x_2\: u_{{\rm R}(0)}u_{{\rm I}(0)}$ is 
a dimensionless number, which is exponentially suppressed 
in terms of the wall distance~$\pi R$, 
and the scalar mass parameter~$m_0^2$ is defined as 
\begin{eqnarray}
 m_0^2 \!\!\!&\equiv\!\!\!& -\int\!\!{\rm d} x_2\: W'''(A_{\rm cl})U_{{\rm I}0}u_{{\rm R}(0)}^2 
 =\int\!\!{\rm d} x_2 \: W'''(A_{\rm cl})U_{{\rm R}0}u_{{\rm I}(0)}^2 \nonumber\\
 \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& \int\!\!{\rm d} x_2\: W'''(A_{\rm cl})U_{{\rm I}0}u_{{\rm R}(0)}u_{{\rm I}(0)} 
 =-\int\!\!{\rm d} x_2\: W'''(A_{\rm cl})U_{{\rm R}0}u_{{\rm R}(0)}u_{{\rm I}(0)}, \label{def_m0}
\end{eqnarray}
Here, we have used the formulae Eqs.(\ref{K_vph1-vph2}) and 
(\ref{W_vph1-vph2}), 
and the functions~$U_{{\rm R}0}(x_2)$ and $U_{{\rm I}0}(x_2)$ are defined as 
\begin{eqnarray} 
 U_{{\rm R}0}(x_2) \!\!\!&\equiv\!\!\!& \partial_2A_{\rm cl}(x_2)+W'(A_{\rm cl}(x_2)), \nonumber\\
 U_{{\rm I}0}(x_2) \!\!\!&\equiv\!\!\!& \partial_2A_{\rm cl}(x_2)-W'(A_{\rm cl}(x_2)),  \label{def_URI}
\end{eqnarray}
which are contained in $\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)}$ and $\varphi_{\rm cl}^{(2)}$ as 
\begin{eqnarray}
 \varphi_{\rm cl}^{(1)}(x_2,\theta_1)\!\!\!&=\!\!\!& A_{\rm cl}(x_2)+\frac{i}{2}\theta_1^2U_{{\rm I}0}(x_2), 
 \nonumber\\
 \varphi_{\rm cl}^{(2)}(x_2,\theta_2)\!\!\!&=\!\!\!& A_{\rm cl}(x_2)+\frac{i}{2}\theta_2^2U_{{\rm R}0}(x_2). 
 \label{U_in_vpcl}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that $U_{{\rm R}0}(x_2)$ and $U_{{\rm I}0}(x_2)$ satisfy the mode equations~(\ref{mode_eq2}) 
with $m_{(n)}=0$, and are related to $u_{{\rm R}(0)}(x_2)$ and $u_{{\rm I}(0)}(x_2)$ as 
\begin{equation}
 U_{{\rm R}0}(x_2)=\sqrt{V_0}\,u_{{\rm R}(0)}(x_2), \;\;\;
 U_{{\rm I}0}(x_2)=\sqrt{V_0}\,u_{{\rm I}(0)}(x_2). \label{rel_U-u}
\end{equation}
Equalities in Eq.(\ref{def_m0}) are followed from 
this relation and Eqs.~(\ref{UR-UI_prdct}) and (\ref{WU_piRtrslt}) 
in Appendix~\ref{Acl_prop}. 

From Eqs.(\ref{Lcc}) and (\ref{L_quad}), 
the bosonic part of the 3D Lagrangian~${\cal L}^{(3)}$ is 
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\cal L}^{(3)}_{\rm bosonic} \!\!\!&=\!\!\!& -V_0-\frac{1}{2}
 (\partial^ma^{(1)}_{(0)},\partial^ma^{(2)}_{(0)})\left( \begin{array \right){cc}1&\eta\\\eta&1\end{array}}
