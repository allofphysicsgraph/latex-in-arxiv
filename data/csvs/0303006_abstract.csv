Minkowski space can be sliced, outside the lightcone, in terms of
Euclidean Anti-de Sitter and Lorentzian de Sitter slices. In this
paper we investigate what happens when we apply holography to each
slice separately. This yields a dual description living on two
spheres, which can be interpreted as the boundary of the light
cone. The infinite number of slices gives rise to a continuum
family of operators on the two spheres for each separate bulk
field.
For a free field we explain how the Green's function and
(trivial) S-matrix in Minkowski space can be reconstructed in terms of
two-point functions of some putative conformal field theory on the
two spheres. Based on this we propose a Minkowski/CFT correspondence
which can also be applied to interacting fields.
We comment on the interpretation of the
conformal symmetry of the CFT, and on generalizations to curved
space.
