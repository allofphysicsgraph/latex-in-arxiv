The definition of a generalised calibration in the embedding space ${\cal M}$
adopted here differs from that in \cite{GenCal}. In order to avoid any
confusion in a comparison of the two papers, let us make this difference explicit. 

A generalised calibration $\Phi_{p+1}$in 11 dimensions is gauge equivalent to the
potential $A_{p+1}$ to which the M$p$-brane couples electrically. We can split this up
into the product of an $l$-form $\lambda_{l}$ (where $l = p+1 -m$) along the 
flat 
directions and an $m$-form $\phi_m$ in ${\cal M}$, such that both are 
generalised calibrations in their own subspaces. The components of these forms 
satisfy the relation:
\be
\Phi_{i_0 \dots i_{p+1}} = \lambda_{i_0 \dots i_{l}} \times \phi_{i_{l+1} \dots i_{p+1}}
\equiv A_{i_0 \dots i_{p+1}}
\ee

In \cite{GenCal}, it is simply the gauge potential restricted to ${\cal M}$ which 
is called the generalised calibration $\tilde{A}_m$ in this subspace. 
While this is of course still an $m$-form, its components differ from those of $\phi_m$,
and can infact be obtained from $A_{i_0 \dots i_{p+1}}$ merely by holding the first
$l$ indices fixed, as follows:
\be
\tilde{A}_{i_1 \dots i_m} = A_{1 2...l,i_1 \dots i_m} 
\ee}}

Formulating the solutions in terms of $H_1, H_2$ and $G_{M {\bar{P}}}$,
we find that the harmonic functions, though related to each other as expected,  
are independent of the determinant, G. Moreover, 
$$\partial_{\alpha} G = \partial_{M} G = \partial_{\bar{N}} G = 0.$$
Though this might seem puzzling at first, it is important to realise that we
are not implying that the Hermitean metric is independent of the spatial coordinates; 
merely that such dependences cancel out in its determinant! That this is infact
to be expected can be seen by looking at a flat M5 brane, trivially
embedded in  $\C^3$.\\

{\bf \sf Example:} For an M5 spanning 01$u {\bar u} v {\bar v}$, 
the supergravity solution is given by
$$ds^2 = H^{-1/3} (- dt^2  +  dx_1^2 + du d{\bar u} + dv d{\bar v}) + 
H^{2/3} ( dw d{\bar w} + dx_7^2 + dx_8^2 + dx_9^2 + dx_{10}^2), $$
enabling us to read off the following: 
\bea
H_1^2 = H^{-1/3} \; , \; H_2^2 = H^{2/3} 
&\Rightarrow& \; \; H_1^2 = H_2^{-1}  \; {\rm and }\; \nonumber \\
2 G_{u {\bar u}} =  2 G_{v {\bar v}} = H^{-1/3}  \; , \; 
2 G_{w {\bar w}} = H^{2/3} \; &\Rightarrow& \; 
{\sqrt G} = G_{u {\bar u}} G_{v {\bar v}} G_{w {\bar w}} = 1/8
\nonumber
\eea
Since the determinant of the Hermitean metric is a constant, its derivatives obviously 
vanish.}}
