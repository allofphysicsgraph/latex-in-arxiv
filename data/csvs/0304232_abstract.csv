We construct a manifestly $SO(4)\times SO(4)$ invariant,
supersymmetric extension of the closed string cubic interaction vertex and dynamical
supercharges in light-cone string field theory on the plane wave space-time.
We find that the effective vertex for states built out of bosonic creation
oscillators coincides with the one previously constructed in the
$SO(8)$ formalism and conjecture that in general the two formulations
are physically equivalent.
Further evidence for this claim is obtained from the discrete
$\Zop_2$-symmetry of the plane wave and by
computing the mass-shift of the simplest
stringy state using perturbation theory.
We verify that the leading non-planar correction to
the anomalous dimension of the dual gauge theory operators is
correctly recovered.
