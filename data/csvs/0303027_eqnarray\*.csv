of the modular group. It should be noted that the matrices $S$ and
$T$ carry much more information than a mere linear representation
of $\Gamma\left(1\right)$, for the individual matrix elements have
an invariant meaning in themselves, in other words the representation
comes equipped with a distinguished basis formed by the genus 1 characters
of the primary fields. The properties of the matrix elements with
respect to this distinguished basis are summarized in Verlinde's theorem
\cite{Ver,MS}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The matrix $T$ is diagonal and of finite order;
\item The matrix $S$ is symmetric;
\item The fusion rules of the primaries are given by Verlinde's formula
\[
N_{pqr}=\sum_{s}\frac{S_{p}^{s}S_{q}^{s}S_{r}^{s}}{S_{0}^{s}}\,,\]
where $0$ labels the vacuum (the conformal block of the identity).
\end{enumerate}
One may show that the modular representation is quite special in many
respects, the basic result being the congruence subgroup property
mentioned in the introduction, i.e. that the kernel $\ker D$ of the
modular representation is a congruence subgroup of level $N$
\cite{CMP}. One may also show that the \emph{conductor} $N$,
which is equal to the order of the matrix $T$, is bounded by a universal
function of the dimension (= number of primary fields). Moreover,
if we denote by $K$ the projective order of $T$, i.e. the smallest
positive integer such that $T^{K}$ is a scalar matrix, then the integer
$e=\frac{N}{K}$ is a divisor of $12$ \cite{CMP}. The integers
$e$ and $K$ are important characteristics of the model.

Because the individual matrix elements have an invariant meaning,
it is meaningful to look at their arithmetic properties, which is
the content of the theory of the Galois action \cite{BG,CG1}. The
basic idea is to look at the field $F$ obtained by adjoining to the
rationals the matrix elements of all modular matrices (it is enough
to adjoin those of the generators $S$ and $T$). It turns out that
the field $F$ equals the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}\left[ \zeta_{N\right] }$, where $N$
is the conductor of the model. By a well known result of algebraic
number theory, the Galois group of the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}\left[ \zeta_{N\right] }$
over $\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the group $\mathcal{G}_{N}=\left(\mathbb{Z}/NZ\right)^{*}$
of prime residues modulo $N$, where to the prime residue $l\in\mathcal{G}_{N}$
corresponds the map $\sigma_{l}$ sending $\zeta_{N}$ to its
$l$-th power $\zeta_{N}^{l}$. As $\sigma_{l}$ maps $F$ into
itself, it is meaningful to consider its action on the matrix elements
of $S$ and $T$. The basic result \cite{BG,CG1}, which follows from
Verlinde's theorem, is \[
\sigma_{l}\left(S_{q}^{p}\right)=\varepsilon_{l}\left(q\right)S_{\pi_{l}q}^{p}\,,\]
where $\pi_{l}$ is a permutation of the primaries - the \emph{Galois
permutation} associated to $l\in\mathcal{G}_{N}$ -, while $\varepsilon_{l}\left(q\right)=\pm1$
is a sign. The above Galois permutations define a permutation action
of $\mathcal{G}_{N}$ on the set of primaries, because they satisfy $\pi_{lm}=\pi_{l}\pi_{m}$.


\section{Galois currents}

According to the traditional definition \cite{sc1,sc2,sc3}, a simple
current is a primary field $\alpha$ whose quantum dimension is $1$,
i.e. such that $S_{0}^{\alpha}=S_{0}^{0}$. From this definition follows
that the fusion product of a simple current $\alpha$ with a primary
$p$ is again a primary field, denoted $\alpha p$, i.e. simple currents
induce permutations of the primaries. Of course, the permutations
arising this way are quite special, and it is a challenging problem
to characterize those permutation groups that may correspond to the
action of simple currents on the primary fields of some RCFT. In any
case, this induced permutation action allows us to consider for each
simple current $\alpha$ the set \[
L_{\alpha}="
