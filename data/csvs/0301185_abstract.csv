We construct a classical mechanics Hamiltonian
which exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking akin
the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, dimensional transmutation,
and asymptotically free self-similarity congruent
with the beta-function of four dimensional Yang-Mills theory.
Its classical equations of motion support
stable periodic orbits and in a
three dimensional projection these orbits are self-linked
into topologically nontrivial, toroidal knots.
