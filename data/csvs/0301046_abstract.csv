Following the work of Kinnersley and Walker for flat spacetimes,
we have analyzed the anti-de Sitter C-metric in a previous paper.
In the de Sitter case, Podolsk\'y and Griffiths have established
that the de Sitter C-metric (dS C-metric) found by Pleba\'nski and
Demia\'nski describes a pair of accelerated black holes in the dS
background with the acceleration being provided (in addition to
the cosmological constant) by a strut that pushes away the two
black holes or, alternatively, by a string that pulls them. We
extend their analysis mainly in four directions. First, we draw
the Carter-Penrose diagrams of the massless uncharged dS C-metric,
of the massive uncharged dS C-metric and of the massive charged dS
C-metric. These diagrams allow us to clearly identify the presence
of two dS black holes and to conclude that they cannot interact
gravitationally. Second, we revisit the embedding of the dS
C-metric in the 5D Minkowski spacetime and we represent the motion
of the dS C-metric origin in the dS 4-hyperboloid as well as the
localization of the strut. Third, we comment on the physical
properties of the strut that connects the two black holes.
Finally, we find the range of parameters that correspond to
non-extreme black holes, extreme black holes, and naked particles.
