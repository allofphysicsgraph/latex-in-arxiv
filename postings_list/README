Generates a Postings List with a fixed vocabulary of words or phrases. 
A posting list is a list of terms, along with their positions in the document. The postings list is used to efficiently retrieve documents that contain specific terms or phrases.

Docker instructions 

run make docker in the latex-in-arxiv directory
then after the docker container is running 

running make scanner inside the docker container, this is required because it takes 3-4 minutes to compile. 


run make scanner 
then scanner.out . 
the '.'  can be any directory with tex files.


should take roughly 3 seconds to process the 1019 files from the 2003 sample dataset
the file name should be printed before the tokens from the file. 

This process previously took ~11 minutes and had far more errors related to matching groups of text like equations, fractions, abstract etc.


if you are interested in the offsets and lengths instead of the 
string uncomment  //	printf("%zd %zd\n", offsets->offset[i],  offsets->length[i]);
in the reader.rl file 

and comment printf("%s▁ ",output);
a few lines below

to add regex or new latex strings edit latex.rl
to add new vocabulary such as new words or phrases
edit vocab.rl 

it's ideal to keep the files around 10k or fewer lines. 
if you need more, add a new vocab file and inlude it in the scanner.rl
