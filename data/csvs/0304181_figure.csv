\caption{The projection to fixed $(t,\theta,\psi)$ plane of a null
geodesic which is tangent to the velocity of light surface at an
instant and spirals in towards the horizon in the future and in the
past. The dotted line is the velocity of light surface and the shaded
region is the region inside the horizon.
