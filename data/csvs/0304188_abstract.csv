Overall, brane inflation is compatible with the recent analysis
of the WMAP data. Here we explore the constraints of WMAP and 2dFGRS data
on the various brane inflationary scenarios. Brane inflation
naturally ends with the production of cosmic strings, which may provide
a way to distinguish these models observationally. We argue that
currently available data cannot exclude a non-negligible contribution
from cosmic strings definitively. We perform a partial statistical analysis
of mixed models that include a sub-dominant contribution from cosmic
strings. Although the data favor models without cosmic strings,
we conclude that they cannot definitively rule out a 
cosmic-string-induced contribution of
$\sim 10 \%$ to the observed temperature, polarization and galaxy density
fluctuations. These results imply that $G\mu\lesssim
1.3\times 10^{-6}\sqrt{B\lambda/0.1}$, where $\lambda\leq 1$ is a measure of the
intercommutation probability of the cosmic string networks, and 
$B$ measures the importance of perturbations induced by cosmic strings.
We argue that, conservatively, the data available currently still permit
$B\lesssim 0.1$.
%, and even more conservatively $B\lesssim 0.025$.
Precision measurements sensitive to the B-mode polarization produced by
vector density perturbation modes driven by the string network could
provide evidence for these
models. Accurate determinations of $n_s(k)$, the scalar fluctuation index,
could also distinguish among various brane inflation models.
