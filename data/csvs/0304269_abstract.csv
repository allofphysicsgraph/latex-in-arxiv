We discuss a new class of brane models (extending both $p$-brane and $Dp$-brane 
cases) where the brane tension appears as an {\em additional dynamical degree of
freedom}~ instead of being put in by hand as an {\em ad hoc}~ dimensionfull scale.
Consistency of dynamics naturally involves the appearence of additional higher-rank
antisymmetric tensor gauge fields on the world-volume 
% (beyond the standard $Dp$-brane world-volume $U(1)$ vector gauge field) 
which can couple to charged
lower-dimensional branes living on the original $Dp$-brane world-volume.
The dynamical tension has the physical meaning of electric-type field strength of
the additional higher-rank world-volume gauge fields. It obeys Maxwell (or 
Yang-Mills) equations of motion (in the string case $p=1$) or their higher-rank
gauge theory analogues (in the $Dp$-brane case). This in particular triggers
a simple classical mechanism of (``color'') charge confinement.
