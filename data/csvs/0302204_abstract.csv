The action and the thermodynamics of a rotating black hole
in the presence of a positive cosmological constant are analyzed.
Since there is no spatial infinity, one must bring in, instead, a platform where
the parameters characterizing the thermodynamic ensemble
are specified. In the present treatment the platform in question is taken to be
one of the two horizons, which is considered as a boundary.
If the boundary is taken to be the cosmological horizon one deals with
the action and thermodynamics of the black hole horizon.
Conversely, if one takes the black hole horizon as the boundary, one deals with
the action and thermodynamics of the cosmological horizon. The two systems are different.
 Their energy and angular momenta are equal in magnitude but have opposite sign.
In either case, the energy and the angular momentum are obtained as surface terms
on the boundary, according to the standard Hamiltonian procedure. The temperature
and the rotational chemical potential are also expressed in terms of magnitudes on the boundary.
If, in the resulting expressions, one continues the cosmological constant to negative values, the black hole
thermodynamic parameters defined on the cosmological horizon coincide with those calculated at spatial infinity in the
asymptotically anti-de Sitter case.
