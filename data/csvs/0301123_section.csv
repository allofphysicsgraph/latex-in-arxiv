\section{$AdS_{(p,q)}$ and its horospheres}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let us recall some elementary facts on horospheric coordinates (\cite{Alvarez}).
 For arbitrary $\pm$ signs, denoted by $\epsilon_{\m} = \pm 1$, the metric induced on the surface
\be\label{def}
\sum_{\m = 1}^{n+1}  \epsilon_{\m} x_{\m}^2 = \pm l^2
\ee
by the imbedding on the flat space with metric
\be
ds^2 =\sum_{\m = 1}^{n+1}  \epsilon_{\m} d x_{\m}^2 
\ee
can easily be reduced to a generalization of Poincar\'e's metric for the half-plane by introducing the coordinates
\bea
&&\frac{l}{z}\equiv x^{-}\nonumber\\
&&y^{i}\equiv z ~x^{i}
\eea
where we have chosen the two last coordinates, $x^{n}$  and $ x^{n+1}$ in such a way that their 
contribution to the metric
is $ dx_{n}^2 - dx_{n+1}^2$ (this is always possible if we have at least one timelike coordinate); and we define
$x^{-}\equiv x^{n+1} - x^{n}$. $ 1\leq i,j\ldots\leq  n-1$.
The generalization of the Poincar\'e metric is:
\be
ds^2 = \frac{\sum \epsilon_{i} dy_{i}^2 \mp l^2 dz^2}{z^2}
\ee
(where the signs are correlated with the ones defined in (\ref{def}), 
and the surfaces ${z=const}$ are called {\em horospheres} in the mathematical literature.
\par
The curvature scalar is given by:
\be
R=\pm \frac{n(n-1)}{l^2}
\ee
It is clear, on the other hand, that the isometry group of the corresponding manifold is
one of the real forms of the complex algebra $SO(n+1)$. The Killing vector fields are
explicitly given (no sum in the definition) by
\be
L_{\m\n}\equiv \epsilon_{\m}x^{\m}\pd_{\n}-\epsilon_{\n}x^{\n}\pd_{\m}
\ee
To be specific, when the metric is given by:
\be
ds^2=\frac{\delta_{ij}dx^i dx^j\mp l^2 dz^2}{z^2}
\ee
then the isometry group is $SO(n,1)$. This is the case for what could be 
 called 
{\em euclidean de Sitter}, $EdS_n$, which in our conventions has got 
all coordinates timelike, and {\em negative} curvature.
\par
The symmetric situation where
\be
ds^2=\frac{-\delta_{ij}dx^i dx^j\mp l^2 dz^2}{z^2}
\ee
enjoys $SO(1,n)$ as isometry group, and includes the ordinary de Sitter
space, $dS_n$. What one would want to call Euclidean anti de Sitter , 
$EAdS_n$, 
has got all its coordinates spacelike, and {\em positive} curvature.
\par
Finally, when the metric is given by
\be
ds^2=\frac{\eta_{ij}dx^i dx^j\mp l^2 dz^2}{z^2}
\ee
(where as usual, $\eta_{ij}\equiv diag(1,(-1)^{n-2})$),then the isometry 
group is $SO(2,n-1)$. This includes the regular Anti de Sitter, $AdS_n$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The Low Energy Limit}\label{Lowenergy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
If we characterize the metric in the $A_{n+2}$ ambient space as
\be
ds^2 = \frac{t^2}{l^2}h_{ij}(x,\rho)dx^i dx^j + \r dt^2 + t dt d\r
\ee\label{hs}
then its Ricci tensor reads
\bea\label{einstein}
&&l^2 R^A_{ij}=\rho [2 h''_{ij} - 2 h'_{il}h^{lm}h'_{mj} + 
h^{kl}h'_{lk} h'_{ij}]+ 
l^2 R_{ij}[h]-
(d-2)h'_{ij} - tr(h^{kl}h'_{kl})h_{ij}]\nonumber\\
&&=l^2 R_{ij}^{Bulk} -\frac{d}{\rho}h_{ij}\nonumber\\
&&R^A_{it}\equiv 0\nonumber\\
&&R^A_{i\rho}=\frac{1}{2}[h^{jl}(\nabla_j h'_{il} - \nabla_i h'_{jl})]
=R_{i\rho}^{Bulk}\nonumber\\
&&R^A_{\rho\rho}=-\frac{1}{2}[(h^{jk}h''_{kj}) -
\frac{1}{2} (h^{il}h'_{lm}h^{mn}h'_{ni})]=R_{\rho\rho}^{Bulk}+\frac{d}{4\rho^2}\nonumber\\
&&R^A_{\rho t}=0\nonumber\\
&&R^A_{tt}=0
\eea
where a prime means $\frac{d}{d\rho}$,and $\nabla_i$ is the covariant 
derivative
of the Levi-Civita connection of the metric $h_{ij}$. Demanding that this 
$(n+2)$-dimensional Ricci tensor vanishes reproduces 
the $(n+1)$-dimensional Einstein's equations
corresponding to a fixed cosmological constant
$\lambda=\frac{n(n-1)}{2 l^2}$ (cf. for example eq. (191) in \cite{Alvarez})


We have indeed represented by a superscript  the corresponding 
quantities in 
the five dimensional bulk space, which is defined as the manifold endowed with a metric:
\be
ds^2=- \frac{l^2}{4\rho^2}d\rho^2+\frac{1}{\rho} h_{ij}dx^i dx^j
\ee
Please refer to \cite{Alvarez} for an expansion in powers of $\e$ of this set of equations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The six-dimensional Ambient Space associated to flat four-dimensional space}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let us work out the simplest possible example, namely, the $A_6$ ambient space 
corresponding to a flat four dimensional space. This  is, expressed in the canonical coordinates
introduced by Fefferman and Graham (FG), (\cite{fefferman})
\be
ds^2=-\frac{t^2}{l^2} d\vec{x}^2+\rho dt^2 + td\rho dt
\ee

In this case, there is a very simple scale and  invariance in the 
ambient space, namely
\bea
&&x\rightarrow\lambda x\nonumber\\
&&t\rightarrow \frac{1}{\lambda} t\nonumber\\
&&\rho\rightarrow \lambda^2 \rho
\eea

\par

Through the  study of  its geodesics, it is not difficult to find a change of 
coordinates which reduces it to flat six-dimensional space, namely,
\bea\label{change}
&& t\equiv \xi_0-\xi_5 \nonumber\\
&&x^i\equiv \frac{l \xi^i}{\xi_0-\xi_5}\nonumber\\
&&\rho\equiv \frac{(\xi^{\mu})^2}{(\xi_0-\xi_5)^2}\nonumber\\
\eea
where $(\xi^{\mu})^2=\xi_0^2-\xi_5^2-\vec{\xi}^2$. The flat space 
$\mathbb{R}^6$ with coordinates $\xi^{\m}\equiv (\xi^0,\vec{\xi},\xi^5)$, reads
\be
ds^2=\eta_{\m\n}d\xi^{\m}d\xi^{\n}
\ee
(where $\eta_{\m\n}=diag(1,(-1)^{5})$).
The inverse change of coordinates is given by:
\bea\label{inverse}
&&\xi^0=\frac{t}{2}(1+\rho+\frac{x^2}{l^2})\nonumber\\
&&\xi^5=\frac{t}{2}(- 1+\rho+\frac{x^2}{l^2})\nonumber\\
&&\xi^i=\frac{x^i}{l}t
\eea
Lorentz transformations enjoy a nonlinear realization in the FG coordinates.
The scale invariance in the FG coordinates, for example, 
 corresponds to a boost in the $\xi^5$ direction in the Minkowskian
 coordinates. If we perform a general Lorentz transformation 
$\xi^{\m}={\Lambda^{\m}}_{\n}\xi^{\n}=({\d^{\m}}_{\n}+{\theta^{\m}}_{\n})\xi^{\n}$
where
\be
\theta_{\m\n}= \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -\omega &  \frac{\vec{\a}+\vec{\b}}{2}  \\
\omega & 0 &   \frac{\vec{\a}-\vec{\b}}{2}  \\
-\frac{\vec{\a}+\vec{\b}}{2}  & -\frac{\vec{\a}-\vec{\b}}{2}  & 
\theta_{ij}\\
\end{array}    \right)
\ee
the corresponding change (linearized) in the FG coordinates reads
\be \begin{array}{l}
\d t= t (\omega+\frac{\vec{\a}\vec{x}}{l}) \\
\d \r= -2\r (\omega+\frac{\vec{\a}\vec{x}}{l})  \\
\d x^{i}= \frac{l}{2}b^i - \omega x^i +{\theta^{i}}_{j}x^{j} 
+\frac{l}{2}(\r +\frac{x^{2}}{l^{2}})a^i-\frac{\vec{\a}\vec{x}}{l}x^i
\end{array}
\ee


\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Horizons}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The corresponding jacobian of the change of coordinates (\ref{change})
reads
\be
|\det{\frac{\pd \xi^{\m}}{\pd (\rho,y, x^i)}}|=\frac{1}{2 l^n}|t^{n+1}|
\ee
This means that 
there is a horizon at $t=0$, and we are only covering one-half of
Minkowski space, namely a {\em Minkowski wedge},
\be
\xi_0>\xi_{n+1}
\ee
There are then two interesting hypersurfaces in our problem:$B\equiv\{\rho=0\}$
(which we will call the {\em boundary}, a null surface, with null normal vector
$n^2=\frac{2\rho}{t^2}=0$), and $\Sigma\equiv\{t=0\}$ (which is the {\em 
horizon}
determining the portion of Minkowski space covered by the standard 
FG coordinates). The horizon is also a null surface, $n^2=0$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{T Dual Forms}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nothing prevents us from assuming that the coordinates $x^i$ live in a torus.
The relationship to the Minkowkski wedge is then lost.
For example, in the simplest case in which all coordinates live in a circle of radius
$L$, there is an equivalent  T-dual formulation (\cite{Giveon}) of the sort
\be
ds^2 = -\frac{l^2 }{t^2}d\vec{x}^2+\rho dt^2 + td\rho dt
\ee
and a dilaton
\be
\Phi=-\frac{n}{2}\log{\frac{t^2}{l^2}}
\ee
Non constant dilatons are notoriously difficult to work with; the original
 representation of the background will be then usually preferred.
