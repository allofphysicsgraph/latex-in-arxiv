\noindent 1.~\textit{Nonabelian field strength}:
The $F_{ab}$ appearing explicitly in both terms
is now nonabelian, of course.
%\item

\noindent 2.~\textit{Nonabelian Taylor expansion}:
The bulk supergravity fields
are again functions of all of the spacetime coordinates, and so
they are implicitly functionals of the nonabelian scalars.
In the action (\ref{finalbi},\ref{finalcs}), these bulk fields are
again interpreted in terms of a Taylor expansion as in eq.~(\ref{slick}),
however the transverse displacements are now matrix-valued.
the D-brane action would be given by a {nonabelian} Taylor expansion

\noindent 3.~\textit{Nonabelian Pullback}:
As was noted in refs.~\cite{hull,dorn}, the pullback of various spacetime tensors
to the world-volume must now involve covariant derivatives of the nonabelian scalars
in order to be consistent with the U(N) gauge symmetry. Hence eq.~(\ref{pull}) is
replaced by
\begin{equation}
P[E]_{ab}=E_{ab}+\lambda\,E_{ai}\,D_{b}\Phi^i+ \lambda\,E_{ib}\,
D_a\Phi^i+ \lambda^2\,E_{ij}D_a\Phi^iD_b\Phi^j\ . \label{pulla}
\end{equation}

\noindent 4.~\textit{Nonabelian Interior Product}:
In the Wess-Zumino term (\ref{finalcs}),
$\hi_\Phi$ denotes the interior product with $\Phi^i$ regarded
as a vector in the transverse space, {\it e.g.}, acting on an $n$-form
$C^{(n)}={1\over n!}C^{(n)}_{\mu_1\cdots\mu_n} dx^{\mu_1}\cdots dx^{\mu_n}$,
we have
\begin{equation}
\hi_\Phi\hi_\Phi C^{(n)}={1\over2(n-2)!}\,[\Phi^i,\Phi^j]\,
C^{(n)}_{ji\mu_3\cdots\mu_n}dx^{\mu_3}\cdots dx^{\mu_n}
\ . \label{inside}
\end{equation}
Note that acting on forms, the interior product is an anticommuting operator
and hence for an ordinary vector ({\it i.e.,}\  a vector $v^i$ with values in
$\mathR^{9-p}$):
$\hi_v\hi_vC^{(n)}=0$. It is only because the scalars $\Phi$ are matrix-valued
that eq.~(\ref{inside}) yields a nontrivial result.
%\item
\vskip 1ex
\noindent 5.~\textit{Nonabelian Gauge Trace}:
As is evident above, both parts of the action
are highly nonlinear functionals of the nonabelian fields, and so
eqs.~(\ref{finalbi})
and (\ref{finalcs}) would be incomplete without a precise definition for the
ordering of these fields under the gauge trace. Above, ${\rm STr}$ denotes the
maximally symmetric trace \cite{arkady}. To be precise, the trace includes a
symmetric average over all orderings of $F_{ab}$,
$D_a\Phi^i$, $[\Phi^i,\Phi^j]$ and the individual $\Phi^k$ appearing in the
nonabelian Taylor expansions of the background fields. This choice matches
that inferred from Matrix theory \cite{wati4}, and a similar symmetrization
arises in the leading order analysis of the boundary $\beta$ functions
\cite{dorn}. However, we should note that
with this definition an expansion of the Born-Infeld term (\ref{biact}) does
agree with the string theory to fourth order in $F$ \cite{arkady,ark2},
but it does not seem to capture the full physics of the nonabelian
fields in the infrared limit at higher orders \cite{wati5}  --- we expand on
this point below.
