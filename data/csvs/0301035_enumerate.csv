 \item We need clarify the building blocks possessing good modular 
properties to describe the massive world-sheet theory for the transverse
sector.
 \item We need integrate out suitably the longitudinal degrees of freedom that
       are not decoupled in the relevant backgrounds.
 \item It is known \cite{Michelson} that the world-sheet Hamiltonian 
       in the light-cone gauge only includes the winding modes and 
       includes no Kaluza-Klein (KK) momenta along the compactified circle. 
       It seems quite puzzling how we can achieve modular invariant 
       amplitudes in this situation.
